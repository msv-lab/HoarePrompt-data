The value of `lmn[i]` is updated to the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `lmn[1]` is now set to the value of `lmn[2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements with `lmn[1]` set to `lmn[2]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `lmn` and `lmx` must have at least 200009 elements.**
