The code snippet `rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]` updates the value of `rmx[200006]` to be the same as `rmx[200007]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 200007
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- If `rmx[200007]` is less than `rmx[200008]`, then `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `rmx[200006]` is updated to the value of `rmx[200007]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200007, and if `rmx[200007]` is less than `rmx[200008]`, then `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`, `rmx[200006]` is equal to `rmx[200007]`.**
