The given code snippet `s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))` updates the list `s` based on the sum of `x` and `y`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive)
   - `i` is 1
   - `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers
   - `s` is `[[], []]` if `x + y` is even, otherwise `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]`
   - `x` is the third element of `dat`
   - `y` is the fourth element of `dat`
   - `n` must be greater than 1

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `x + y & 1` computes the bitwise AND of the sum of `x` and `y` with 1. This will be 0 if `x + y` is even and 1 if `x + y` is odd.
   - `s[x + y & 1]` selects the appropriate sublist in `s` based on whether `x + y` is even or odd.
   - `(-x + y, x + y)` is a tuple containing the values `-x + y` and `x + y`.
   - `s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))` appends this tuple to the selected sublist in `s`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `s` is updated based on the parity of `x + y`.
   - If `x + y` is even, `s[0]` will have the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` appended to it.
   - If `x + y` is odd, `s[1]` will have the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` appended to it.
   - Other variables (`n`, `i`, `dat`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y)], []]`, `x` is the third element of `dat`, `y` is the fourth element of `dat`, `n` must be greater than 1**
