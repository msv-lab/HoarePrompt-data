Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)] > y`, then `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)] < y`, then `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001; `x` is `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`; `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`. If `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)] < y`, then `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y`. Otherwise, `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` remains unchanged.***
