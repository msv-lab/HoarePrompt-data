To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on the variables over all iterations. Let's break down the loop and its impact on the variables step by step.

### Initial State
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `lmx[i]` is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in xrange(200010):
    if lmx[i] > rmx[i]:
        lmx[i] = rmx[i]
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200009 (inclusive), so it runs 200010 times.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `lmx[i]` is greater than `rmx[i]`.
   - If `lmx[i]` is greater than `rmx[i]`, `lmx[i]` is updated to `rmx[i]`.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - After the loop completes, for each index `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmx[i]` will be the minimum of its original value and `rmx[i]`.
   - This means that `lmx[i]` will be updated to the smaller value between `lmx[i]` and `rmx[i]` for each `i`.

### Final Output State
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum of the original maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x` and the corresponding value in `rmx`.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` remains a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
