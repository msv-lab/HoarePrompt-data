To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`, then `lmn[i]` is updated to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 200009.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
- **Check List Length**: The loop condition `i < 200009` ensures that the loop can execute up to 200008 times. Therefore, the lists `lmn` and `lmx` must have at least 200009 elements to avoid an index out of range error.

### Updated State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `lmn` and `lmx` must have at least 200009 elements.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `lmn` and `lmx` must have at least 200009 elements.**
