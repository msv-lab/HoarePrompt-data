To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given code:

### Code Analysis:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Key Points:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range `xrange(200009)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to 200008.
2. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts includes several variables and lists:
   - `a` is a list of tuples representing the coordinates of black tokens.
   - `inf` is 1001001001.
   - `C` is 400010.
   - `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
   - `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

### Requirements for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if the range `xrange(200009)` is valid, which it is because the range is from 0 to 200008 (inclusive).
- The variable `i` must start at 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` should start at 0.
- **Range Validity**: The range `xrange(200009)` is valid as it is a fixed range from 0 to 200008, so no adjustment is needed for this part.

### Final State:
The state needs to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and the range is valid. The other variables and lists do not need to be adjusted as they are already defined correctly.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0**
