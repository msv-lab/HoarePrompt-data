Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (where `x` is transformed from the original x-coordinate using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`) is updated to the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (where `x` is transformed from the original x-coordinate using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`) is updated to the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.**
