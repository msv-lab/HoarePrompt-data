The value of `rmn[i - 1]` is updated to be equal to the value of `rmn[i]`. Given that `i` is 200008, this means `rmn[200007]` is set to the value of `rmn[200008]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with `rmn[200008]` now equal to `rmn[200009]` if `rmn[200008]` was greater than `rmn[200009]`, otherwise `rmn` remains unchanged, `rmn[200007]` is equal to `rmn[200008]`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `i` is 200008.
