The provided code calls `func_1` on two lists of tuples, `s[0]` and `s[1]`, and prints the sum of their results. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the specific values it returns. However, we can infer that `func_1` processes the tuples in `s[0]` and `s[1]` and returns a numeric value for each call.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **`s[0]` and `s[1]`**: These lists contain tuples based on the parity of the sum of `x` and `y`. The content of these lists is not modified by the code.
2. **`func_1(s[0])` and `func_1(s[1])`**: These function calls process the lists and return numeric values. The specific values returned depend on the implementation of `func_1`.
3. **`print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))`**: This line prints the sum of the results from the two function calls.

### Variables Affected:
- The variables `n`, `i`, and `dat` are not directly affected by the code.
- The lists `s[0]` and `s[1]` are not modified.
- The output of the print statement is the sum of the results of `func_1(s[0])` and `func_1(s[1])`.

### Output State:
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `dat` remains a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers.
- `s` remains a list where `s[0]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is even, and `s[1]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is odd.
- The sum of `func_1(s[0])` and `func_1(s[1])` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is `n - 1`, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is a list where `s[0]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is even, and `s[1]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is odd, and the sum of `func_1(s[0])` and `func_1(s[1])` is printed.**
