The value of `lmx[i]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `lmx[2]` is set to the value of `rmx[2]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Specifically:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `lmx[i]` is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`. Now, `lmx[2]` is specifically set to `rmx[2]`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `i` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `lmx[i]` is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, with `lmx[2]` now equal to `rmx[2]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `i` is 2.**
