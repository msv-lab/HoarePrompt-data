To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- For all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i] and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `lmn[1]` is less than `lmx[1]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[1] - lmn[1]) / 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 200008 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1 and remains within the range [0, 200008].

### Adjusting the State:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, incrementing it by 1 gives `i = 2`.
- **Check Range**: The new value of `i` (which is 2) is still within the range [0, 200008], so the loop will execute again.

### Updated State:
- `a` remains a list of tuples.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains a list of 400010 elements as described.
- `lmx` remains a list of 400010 elements as described.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` remains a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is now 2.
- If `lmn[2]` is less than `lmx[2]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[2] - lmn[2]) / 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i]` and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 2. If `lmn[2]` is less than `lmx[2]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (lmx[2] - lmn[2]) / 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
