The code `lmx[i] = lmx[i + 1]` updates the value of `lmx[i]` to be the same as the value of `lmx[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `lmx[1]` is set to the value of `lmx[2]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmx[1]` is equal to `lmx[2]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1.**
