To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- For all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i]` and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `lmn[i]` is less than `lmx[i]`, then `ans` is updated to `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration Variable (`i`)**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `200008` (inclusive), which means `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `200008`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - All other variables (`a`, `inf`, `C`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i]` and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 1. If `lmn[i]` is less than `lmx[i]`, then `ans` is updated to `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
