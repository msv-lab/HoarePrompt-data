To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will iterate over the range from 0 to 200008 (inclusive), which means it will run 200009 times. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:

1. The range `xrange(200009)` must be valid and non-empty.
2. The variable `i` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `ans` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically:

- `i` should start at 0.
- The range `200009` must be valid, which it is since it is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initialization of `i` to 0. The other variables and lists are already in a state that allows the loop to execute without modification.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
