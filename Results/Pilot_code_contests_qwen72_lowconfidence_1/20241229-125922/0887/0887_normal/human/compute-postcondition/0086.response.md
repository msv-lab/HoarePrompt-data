To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `lmx[0]` > `rmx[0]`, then `lmx[0]` is equal to `rmx[0]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 200009 (inclusive). This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 200010.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains unchanged.
- `lmx` remains unchanged.
- `rmn` remains unchanged.
- `rmx` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now 1.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `i` is 1. If `lmx[1]` > `rmx[1]`, then `lmx[1]` is equal to `rmx[1]`.**
