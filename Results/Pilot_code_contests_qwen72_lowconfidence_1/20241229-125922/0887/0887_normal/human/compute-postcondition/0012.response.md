Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is `n - 1`, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is a list where `s[0]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is even, and `s[1]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is odd.**
