Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`. If `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]` and `lmn[1]` is the minimum value between `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`. `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`. `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`. `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`. `i` is 2. If `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, then `lmn[2]` is set to `rmn[2]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]`, and `lmn[1]` is the minimum value between `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`. Otherwise, the lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` remain unchanged.***
