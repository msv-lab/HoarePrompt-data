To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- For all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i] and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `ans` is 0.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200008 (inclusive). This means the loop will execute 200009 times.
2. **Dependencies**:
   - The loop does not depend on any specific initial values of `a`, `inf`, `C`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`, or `ans` other than their existence and the structure of `lmn` and `lmx` as described.
   - The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is since 200009 is a positive integer.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is.
- No specific adjustments to the initial state are required for the loop to execute, as the loop's execution is solely dependent on the range and not on the values of the variables.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i]` and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0**.
