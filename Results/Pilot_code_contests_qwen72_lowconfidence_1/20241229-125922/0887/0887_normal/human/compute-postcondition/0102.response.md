The value of `lmn[i]` is updated to be the same as the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `lmn[2]` is now set to the value of `lmn[3]`.

Other variables and their values remain unchanged. The lists `lmn` and `lmx` still have at least 200009 elements each.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmn[2] = lmn[3]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, and `lmn` and `lmx` must have at least 200009 elements.**
