Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `lmn[i]` is less than the current value of `lmn[i + 1]`***
