To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the parameters and conditions required for the loop to start and continue. The loop in question is:

```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 200009.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.

2. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must initially be 200009.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` remains greater than 0.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - The initial value of `i` must be 200009.
   - The lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` must be properly initialized and have the correct values as described in the state before the loop starts.

### Final State Adjustment:
- The initial value of `i` must be 200009.
- The lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` must be correctly initialized with the specified properties.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
