The given code snippet updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be equal to `lmx[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.

The code `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` means `lmx[3]` is set to the value of `lmx[2]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2, `lmx[3]` is equal to `lmx[2]`.**
