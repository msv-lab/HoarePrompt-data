To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is 200009.
- If `rmx[200008]` is less than `rmx[200009]`, then `rmx[200008]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[200009]`.
- The current value of `rmx[200008]` is now equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `i = 200009` down to `i = 1` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 200009.
   - `rmx[200008]` is updated to be equal to `rmx[200009]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will decrement `i` by 1, so `i` will be 200008.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is decremented by 1, so it becomes 200008.
- The value of `rmx[200008]` remains the same as it was updated in the previous iteration to be equal to `rmx[200009]`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200008, and `rmx[200008]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`**.
