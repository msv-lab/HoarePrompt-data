The given code snippet appends a tuple to one of the two lists within `s`, depending on whether the sum of `x` and `y` is odd or even. The specific list is determined by the bitwise AND operation `x + y & 1`. Here's the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the initial state:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers.
   - `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y)], []]`.
   - `x` is the 5th element of `dat`.
   - `y` is the 6th element of `dat`.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

2. **Evaluate the expression `x + y & 1`:**
   - This expression checks the least significant bit of the sum of `x` and `y`.
   - If `x + y` is odd, `x + y & 1` evaluates to 1.
   - If `x + y` is even, `x + y & 1` evaluates to 0.

3. **Determine which list in `s` to append to:**
   - If `x + y` is odd, the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` is appended to the second list (`s[1]`).
   - If `x + y` is even, the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` is appended to the first list (`s[0]`).

4. **Update the state:**
   - The value of `s` changes based on the condition of `x + y` being odd or even.
   - The values of `n`, `i`, `dat`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions, the output state will be:

- If `x + y` is odd:
  - `s` becomes `[[], [(-x + y, x + y), (-x + y, x + y)]]`.
- If `x + y` is even:
  - `s` becomes `[[(-x + y, x + y), (-x + y, x + y)], []]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `x` is the 5th element of `dat`, `y` is the 6th element of `dat`, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y), (-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y), (-x + y, x + y)], []]`**.
