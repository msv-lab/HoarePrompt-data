The code snippet `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the value of `lmx[2]` to be equal to `lmx[1]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means that `lmx[2]` will now have the same value as `lmx[1]`.

The initial state specifies that if `lmx[1]` was initially less than `lmx[0]`, then `lmx[1]` was updated to be equal to `lmx[0]`. Otherwise, `lmx[1]` remained unchanged. Therefore, `lmx[1]` could be either equal to `lmx[0]` or its original value, depending on the comparison.

Since the exact values of `lmx[0]` and `lmx[1]` are not specified, we can only say that `lmx[2]` will be equal to `lmx[1]` after the code execution.

All other variables and their values remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1, `lmx[2]` is equal to `lmx[1]`**.
