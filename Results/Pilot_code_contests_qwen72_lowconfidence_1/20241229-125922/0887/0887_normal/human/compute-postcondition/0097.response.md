Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0. If `lmn[i] < lmn[i + 1]`, then `lmn[i]` is updated to be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.***
