The value of `lmn[i + 1]` is updated to be equal to the value of `lmn[i]`. Since `i` is 0, this means `lmn[1]` is set to the same value as `lmn[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0, and the element at index 1 of `lmn` is now equal to the element at index 0 of `lmn`.**
