The code `rmx[i - 1] = rmx[i]` updates the value at index `i - 1` of the list `rmx` to be the same as the value at index `i`.

Given:
- `i` is 200008
- `rmx[200008]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`

Step-by-step impact:
1. `i - 1` is 200007.
2. The value at `rmx[200007]` is updated to be the same as the value at `rmx[200008]`.
3. Since `rmx[200008]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`, the value at `rmx[200007]` is now the same as `rmx[200009]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a` is a list of tuples
- `inf` is 1001001001
- `C` is 400010
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`
- `i` is 200008
- `rmx[200008]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`
- `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200008, `rmx[200008]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`, `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`**
