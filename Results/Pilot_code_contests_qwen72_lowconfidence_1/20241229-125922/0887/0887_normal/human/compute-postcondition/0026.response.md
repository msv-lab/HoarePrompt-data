The code snippet `rmx = lmx[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmx` and assigns it to the variable `rmx`. This means that `rmx` now holds a new list that contains the same elements as `lmx`.

- `a` remains a list of tuples representing the coordinates of black tokens.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (transformed from the original x-coordinate) is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx` remains a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (transformed from the original x-coordinate) is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a new list that is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
