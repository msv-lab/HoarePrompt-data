The code snippet `lmx[i + 1] = lmx[i]` updates the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to be the same as `lmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, this means `lmx[1]` is set to the value of `lmx[0]`.

Since the current value of `lmx[i + 1]` (which is `lmx[1]`) was initially less than the current value of `lmx[i]` (which is `lmx[0]`), this update will ensure that `lmx[1]` is now equal to `lmx[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0, and `lmx[1]` is now equal to `lmx[0]`.**
