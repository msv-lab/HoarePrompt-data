The code snippet `s[x + y & 1].append((-x + y, x + y))` modifies the list `s` based on the values of `x` and `y`. Let's break down the changes:

- `x + y & 1` calculates the sum of `x` and `y` and applies a bitwise AND operation with 1. This results in 0 if the sum is even and 1 if the sum is odd.
- Depending on the result of `x + y & 1`, the tuple `(-x + y, x + y)` is appended to either `s[0]` or `s[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers
- `s` is `[[], []]`
- `x` is the first element of `dat`
- `y` is the second element of `dat`

After executing the code:
- The value of `s` will be updated based on the calculation of `x + y & 1`.
- If `x + y & 1` is 0, `s[0]` will be `[(x + y, -x + y)]`.
- If `x + y & 1` is 1, `s[1]` will be `[(x + y, -x + y)]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is `[[], []]` if `x + y` is even, otherwise `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]`, `x` is the first element of `dat`, `y` is the second element of `dat`**.
