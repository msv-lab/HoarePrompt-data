Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of distinct tuples `(x, y)` where each coordinate is an integer within the range -105 to 105. It processes these coordinates to compute the minimum and maximum `y` values for each transformed `x` coordinate (using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`). The function then adjusts these minimum and maximum values to ensure they are non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively, across the range of transformed `x` values. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` from 0 to 200008 where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`. If no such `j` exists, the function returns 0. The input list `a` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function. **

### Detailed Summary:
- **Input Parameters**: The function accepts a single parameter `a`, which is a list of tuples `(x, y)` where each `x` and `y` is an integer within the range -105 to 105, and all tuples are distinct.
- **Transformations**:
  - The function initializes two lists `lmn` and `lmx` with default values (`inf` and `-inf` respectively) to store the minimum and maximum `y` values for each transformed `x` coordinate.
  - For each tuple `(x, y)` in `a`, the `x` coordinate is transformed using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` and the corresponding `y` value is used to update `lmn` and `lmx` at the transformed `x` index.
- **Adjustments**:
  - The function creates shallow copies `rmn` and `rmx` of `lmn` and `lmx` respectively.
  - It ensures that `lmn` is non-decreasing and `lmx` is non-increasing by iterating through the lists and updating the values accordingly.
  - It also ensures that the final `lmn` and `lmx` values are the maximum and minimum of their respective original and adjusted values.
- **Final Calculation**:
  - The function calculates the sum of `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` from 0 to 200008 where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`.
  - If no such `j` exists, the function returns 0.
- **Output**:
  - The function returns an integer `ans` which represents the calculated sum.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case 1**: If the input list `a` is empty, the function will initialize `lmn` and `lmx` with default values and return 0 since there are no tuples to process.
- **Edge Case 2**: If all `y` values for a particular transformed `x` are the same, `lmn` and `lmx` for that `x` will be equal, and the contribution to `ans` will be 0.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not handle cases where the input coordinates might be outside the specified range (-105 to 105). While the problem statement assumes valid input, in a real-world scenario, additional checks could be added to validate the input and handle out-of-range values gracefully.
