To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the loop conditions:

### Current State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `lmx[2]` is less than `lmx[1]`, then `lmx[2]` is updated to be equal to `lmx[1]`. Otherwise, `lmx[2]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200009.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other States**: The other states (`a`, `inf`, `C`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these states.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` (now 2) is less than 200009, which is true.

State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2. If `lmx[3]` is less than `lmx[2]`, then `lmx[3]` is updated to be equal to `lmx[2]`. Otherwise, `lmx[3]` remains unchanged.**
