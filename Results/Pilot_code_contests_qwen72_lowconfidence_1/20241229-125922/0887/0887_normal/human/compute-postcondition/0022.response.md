The code snippet updates the `lmx` list at the index calculated by `x = (x - 1) / 2 + 100005` to the value of `y`, which is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)] > y`, then `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001.
- `x` is `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.
- `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `lmx[x]` is updated to `y`.
- All other elements in `lmx` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)] > y`, then `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmx[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001; `x` is `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`; `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.**
