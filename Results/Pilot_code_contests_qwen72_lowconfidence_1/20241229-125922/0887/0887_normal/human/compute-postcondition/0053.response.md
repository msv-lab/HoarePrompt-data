To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue executing.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Statement**: The loop iterates from `200009` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `200009`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i > 0`.
- **Current Value of `i`**: `i` is currently `200009`.
- **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `200008`.

### Adjusted State:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be `200008`.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`a`, `inf`, `C`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the loop control mechanism.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with `rmn[200008]` now equal to `rmn[200009]` if `rmn[200008]` was greater than `rmn[200009]`, otherwise `rmn` remains unchanged, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `i` is 200008**
