To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is 200008.
- `rmx[200008]` is equal to the current value of `rmx[200009]`.
- If `rmx[200007]` is less than `rmx[200008]`, then `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 200009 down to 1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 200008.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making `i` equal to 200007.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be decremented from 200008 to 200007.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` will be 200007, which is greater than 0, the loop will execute again.

### Final State:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains as described.
- `lmx` remains as described.
- `rmn` remains as described.
- `rmx` remains as described, but `rmx[200007]` may be updated based on the condition.
- `i` is now 200007.

### Condition Check:
- If `rmx[200007]` is less than `rmx[200008]`, then `rmx[200007]` is set to `rmx[200009]`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200007, and if `rmx[200007]` is less than `rmx[200008]`, then `rmx[200007]` is equal to `rmx[200009]`.**
