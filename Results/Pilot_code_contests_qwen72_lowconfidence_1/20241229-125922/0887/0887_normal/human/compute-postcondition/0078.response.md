To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the loop conditions:

### Current State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- If `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `lmn[1]` is less than `rmn[1]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]` and `lmn[1]` is the minimum value between `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`. Otherwise, the lists and variables remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200009 (inclusive).
2. The current value of `i` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to become 2.

### Adjustments:
- Increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.
- No other state changes are necessary based on the provided information.

### Updated State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`. If `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]` and `lmn[1]` is the minimum value between `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`. `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`. `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`. `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`. `i` is 2.**
