The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this initialization.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum of the original maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x` and the corresponding value in `rmx`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmx[i]` is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `ans` is 0.**
