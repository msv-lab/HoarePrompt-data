To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `lmn` is modified such that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to 200008 (inclusive), which means it will run 200009 times.
- For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning it must contain at least one element. This is always true because `xrange(200009)` will generate numbers from 0 to 200008, which is 200009 elements.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is in this case.
- The initial state of `i` should be 0, as it is the first value in the range generated by `xrange(200009)`.
- The lists `lmn` and `lmx` must be initialized and have the required properties as described.

### Final State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 0.

### State:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0**
