The code `lmn[x] = y` updates the value of `lmn` at index `x` to `y`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) represents coordinates of a black token.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, initially set such that if `lmn[int(x)] > y`, then `lmn[int(x)]` is updated to `y`, otherwise it remains 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, initially set such that if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y`, otherwise it remains -1001001001.
- `x` is transformed to `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.
- `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.

Given this, the code `lmn[x] = y` will update the `lmn` list at the calculated index `x` to the value of `y`.

### Output State:
- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001.
- `x` is `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`.
- `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmn[int((x - 1) / 2 + 100005)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001; `x` is `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`; `y` is the second coordinate of the next tuple in the list `a`.**
