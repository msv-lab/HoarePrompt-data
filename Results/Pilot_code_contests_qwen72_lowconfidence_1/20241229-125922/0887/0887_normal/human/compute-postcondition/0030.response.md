Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 0. If `lmn[1]` is greater than `lmn[0]`, then `lmn[1]` is updated to be equal to `lmn[0]`.***
