The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of:
- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) indicating the number of black points.
- Followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105) representing the coordinates of the black tokens.

The function processes this input to create a list `s` which contains two sublists. Each sublist in `s` corresponds to the parity of the sum of the coordinates (x + y):
- The first sublist contains tuples (-x + y, x + y) for coordinates where the sum (x + y) is even.
- The second sublist contains tuples (-x + y, x + y) for coordinates where the sum (x + y) is odd.

The function does not return any value explicitly; it processes the input and populates the list `s`.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes the coordinates of black tokens, and populates a list `s` with two sublists based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates. The first sublist contains tuples (-x + y, x + y) for coordinates with an even sum, and the second sublist contains tuples for coordinates with an odd sum.**
