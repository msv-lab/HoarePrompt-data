To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with `rmn[200008]` now equal to `rmn[200009]` if `rmn[200008]` was greater than `rmn[200009]`, otherwise `rmn` remains unchanged.
- If `rmn[200007]` is greater than `rmn[200008]`, then `rmn[200007]` is updated to be equal to `rmn[200008]`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.
- `i` is 200008.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `200009` down to `1` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 200008.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to 200007.

### Adjustments:
- `i` needs to be updated to 200007.
- No other variables or lists need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on the value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with `rmn[200008]` now equal to `rmn[200009]` if `rmn[200008]` was greater than `rmn[200009]`, otherwise `rmn` remains unchanged. If `rmn[200007]` is greater than `rmn[200008]`, then `rmn[200007]` is updated to be equal to `rmn[200008]`. `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `i` is 200007.**
