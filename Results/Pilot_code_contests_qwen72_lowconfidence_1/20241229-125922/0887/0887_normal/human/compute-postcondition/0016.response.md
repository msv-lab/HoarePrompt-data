The code snippet updates the value of `lmx[x]` to `y`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least two tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int(x)] > y`, then `lmn[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, each element is -1001001001.
- `x` is a value in the range 150030.5 to 150033.

After executing the code snippet `lmx[x] = y`:

- The value of `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y`.
- All other elements in `lmx` remain -1001001001.
- The values of `a`, `inf`, `C`, and `lmn` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least two tuples; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int(x)] > y`, then `lmn[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where `lmx[int(x)]` is `y` and all other elements are -1001001001; `x` is a value in the range 150030.5 to 150033.**
