To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and initial conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in xrange(200010):` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 200009` (inclusive). This means the loop will run exactly 200010 times.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list of tuples.
   - `inf` is 1001001001.
   - `C` is 400010.
   - `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
   - `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
   - `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
   - `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will run as long as the range is defined correctly. The range `xrange(200010)` is fixed and does not depend on any variable, so no adjustments are needed for the loop condition itself.
   - The initial state provided is sufficient for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that the lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` are properly initialized and have the correct properties.

Given the above, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that the loop variable `i` starts at 0 and that the lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` are correctly initialized and have the required properties.

**State:**
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `rmn[i]`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `i` is 0.
