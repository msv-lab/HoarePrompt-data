The code snippet updates the values of `x` and `y` by slicing the `dat` map object starting from the index `i * 2` and taking the next two elements. Given that `i` is 2, the slice will start from the 4th element (index 4, since indexing starts at 0) and take the 5th element (index 5). 

Therefore, the new values of `x` and `y` will be the 5th and 6th elements of the `dat` map object, respectively.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the conditions and values of `n`, `i`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y)], []]`, `x` is the 5th element of `dat`, `y` is the 6th element of `dat`, `n` must be greater than 2**
