To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step:

1. **Current State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers.
   - `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y)], []]`.
   - `x` is the third element of `dat`.
   - `y` is the fourth element of `dat`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `dat`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]` if `x + y` is odd, otherwise `s` is `[[(-x + y, x + y)], []]`, `x` is the third element of `dat`, `y` is the fourth element of `dat`, `n` must be greater than 2**
