Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x` and for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0.**
