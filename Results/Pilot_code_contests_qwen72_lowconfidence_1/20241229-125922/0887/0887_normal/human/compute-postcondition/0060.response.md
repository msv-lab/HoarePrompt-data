To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the loop's conditions and how the state variables affect its execution.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in xrange(200009, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates from `200009` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`200009`) must be greater than the ending value (`0`), which is true in this case.
- The variable `i` starts at `200009`.

### State Variables
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is a large constant value (`1001001001`).
- `C` is `400010`.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`.

### Necessary Adjustments
- The loop will execute as long as `200009` is greater than `0`, which is always true.
- The variable `i` must start at `200009` for the loop to begin.

### Final State
The state variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be set to `200009`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, and `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200009**
