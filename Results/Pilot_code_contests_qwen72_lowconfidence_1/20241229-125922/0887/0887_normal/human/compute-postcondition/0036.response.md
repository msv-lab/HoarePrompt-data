Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2. If `lmn[3]` > `lmn[2]`, then `lmn[3]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `lmn[3]` is set to the value of `lmn[2]`.***
