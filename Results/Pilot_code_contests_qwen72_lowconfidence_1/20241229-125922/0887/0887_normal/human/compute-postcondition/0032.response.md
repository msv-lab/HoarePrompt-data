The code snippet `lmn[i + 1] = lmn[i]` updates the element at index `i + 1` of the list `lmn` to be the same as the element at index `i`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `lmn[2]` is set to the value of `lmn[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmn[2]` is equal to `lmn[1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1**.
