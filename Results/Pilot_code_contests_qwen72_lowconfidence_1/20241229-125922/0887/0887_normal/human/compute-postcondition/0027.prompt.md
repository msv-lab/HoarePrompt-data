You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: The code snippet `rmx = lmx[:]` creates a shallow copy of the list `lmx` and assigns it to the variable `rmx`. This means that `rmx` now holds a new list that contains the same elements as `lmx`.

- `a` remains a list of tuples representing the coordinates of black tokens.
- `inf` remains 1001001001.
- `C` remains 400010.
- `lmn` remains a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (transformed from the original x-coordinate) is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx` remains a list of 400010 elements, where each element at index `x` (transformed from the original x-coordinate) is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `rmn` remains a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a new list that is a shallow copy of `lmx`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.**
```
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
