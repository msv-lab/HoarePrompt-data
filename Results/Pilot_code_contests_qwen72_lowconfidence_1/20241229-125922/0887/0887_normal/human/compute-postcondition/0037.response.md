Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, and `lmn` is modified such that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `lmn[i]` is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.**
