Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmx[i]` is the minimum of the original `lmx[i]` and all subsequent elements up to `lmx[200009]`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `i` is 200009. `ans` is the sum of `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` from 0 to 200008 where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`. If no such `j` exists, `ans` remains 0.**
