The code snippet assigns the value of `lmx[i + 1]` to `lmx[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `lmx[2]` will be set to the value of `lmx[3]`.

Since the initial state specifies that if `lmx[i]` > `lmx[i + 1]`, then `lmx[2]` is equal to `lmx[3]`, this condition is met, and the assignment is valid.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `lmx[2]` and retains all other conditions from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, for all indices `i` from 0 to 200008, `lmn[i]` is the maximum of the original `lmn[i]` and `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `lmx[2]` is equal to `lmx[3]`**.
