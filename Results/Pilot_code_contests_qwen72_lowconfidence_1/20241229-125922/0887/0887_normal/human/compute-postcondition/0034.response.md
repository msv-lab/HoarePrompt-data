To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `lmn[2]` > `lmn[1]`, then `lmn[2]` is set to the value of `lmn[1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200009.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

### Adjustments:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- The condition `i < 200009` must still hold true, which it does since 2 is less than 200009.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 2. If `lmn[2]` > `lmn[1]`, then `lmn[2]` is set to the value of `lmn[1]`.**
