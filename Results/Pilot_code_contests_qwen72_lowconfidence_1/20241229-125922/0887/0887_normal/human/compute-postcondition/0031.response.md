To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`.
- `i` is 0.
- If `lmn[1]` is greater than `lmn[0]`, then `lmn[1]` is updated to be equal to `lmn[0]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200009):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 200009.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is `i < 200009`.
   - Since `i` is 0, it is less than 200009, so the loop will execute again.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The lists `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body (which is omitted).

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `inf`, `C`, `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, `rmx`) remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of `lmx`, `i` is 1**.
