The value of `lmn[i]` is updated to be equal to `rmn[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the specific value of `lmn[2]` is now the same as `rmn[2]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `lmn[2]` is equal to `rmn[2]`, if `lmn[i]` is less than `rmn[i]`, `lmn[0]` is set to `rmn[0]` and `lmn[1]` is the minimum value between `rmn[0]` and `rmn[1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`, `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`, `i` is 2.**
