The code snippet `x, y = dat[i * 2:i * 2 + 2]` updates the values of `x` and `y` by slicing the `dat` map object starting from the index `i * 2` and taking the next two elements.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive)
- `i` is 1
- `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers
- `s` is `[[], []]` if `x + y` is even, otherwise `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]`
- `x` is the first element of `dat`
- `y` is the second element of `dat`
- `n` must be greater than 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `i * 2` evaluates to `2` (since `i` is 1)
- `i * 2 + 2` evaluates to `4`
- `x` and `y` are updated to the third and fourth elements of `dat` respectively

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is `[[], []]` if `x + y` is even, otherwise `s` is `[[], [(-x + y, x + y)]]`, `x` is the third element of `dat`, `y` is the fourth element of `dat`, `n` must be greater than 1**
