Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (`stdin`) to process coordinates of black tokens. It expects the first line to contain an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) representing the number of black tokens, followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105) representing the coordinates of each token. The function populates a list `s` with two sublists based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates (`x + y`). Each sublist in `s` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for the respective parity (even or odd). After processing the coordinates, the function calls `func_1` on both sublists and prints the sum of the results. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully consumed, and the sum of the results from `func_1` for both sublists has been printed to the standard output. Edge cases and potential issues include handling invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of coordinates) and ensuring that `func_1` is defined and behaves correctly. **
