To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(200010):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 200009 (inclusive), which means it will execute 200010 times.
- For the loop to execute, the range must be valid, meaning the upper bound (200010) must be greater than the lower bound (0).

### States to Adjust:
- The loop will execute if the range is valid, which it is (200010 > 0).
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 up to 200009.

### Final State:
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the minimum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmn[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the minimum value of `lmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements where each element at index `x` is the maximum `y` value among all tuples in `a` that map to the same transformed `x`.
- `lmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `lmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn` with the property that for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009, `rmn[i]` is the minimum value of `rmn` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, and `rmx[i]` for all indices `i` from 1 to 200009 is the maximum value of `rmx` from index 0 to index `i`.
- `i` is 0.
