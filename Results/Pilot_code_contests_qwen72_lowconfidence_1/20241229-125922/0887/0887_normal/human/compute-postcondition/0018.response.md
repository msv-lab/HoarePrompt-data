To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(x, y)` consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least two tuples.
- `inf` is 1001001001.
- `C` is 400010.
- `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int(x)] > y`, then `lmn[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001.
- `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001.
- `x` is a value in the range 150030.5 to 150033.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more tuples `(x, y)` in the list `a`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` has at least two tuples.
   - `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the current tuple being processed.
   - `lmn` and `lmx` lists are updated based on the values of `x` and `y`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`a`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least one more tuple to process.
- **`x` and `y`**: These values will change to the coordinates of the next tuple in the list `a`.

### Updated State:
- `a` must have at least one more tuple to process.
- `x` and `y` will be the coordinates of the next tuple in the list `a`.

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` depend on the next tuple in the list `a`, we cannot specify them exactly. However, we know that the next tuple will be processed, and the lists `lmn` and `lmx` may be updated accordingly.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (x, y) consists of integers representing the coordinates of a black token, such that -105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105 and all tuples are distinct, and `a` must have at least one more tuple; `inf` is 1001001001; `C` is 400010; `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmn[int(x)] > y`, then `lmn[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain 1001001001; `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, where if `lmx[int(x)] < y`, then `lmx[int(x)]` is updated to `y` and all other elements remain -1001001001; `x` and `y` are the coordinates of the next tuple in the list `a`.**
