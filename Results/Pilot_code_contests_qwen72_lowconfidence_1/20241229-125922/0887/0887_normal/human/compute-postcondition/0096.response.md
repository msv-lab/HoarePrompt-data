The value of `lmn[i]` is updated to the value of `lmn[i + 1]`. Since the initial condition states that `lmn[i]` is less than `lmn[i + 1]`, after the assignment, `lmn[i]` will now be equal to `lmn[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list of tuples, `inf` is 1001001001, `C` is 400010, `lmn` is a list of 400010 elements where `lmn[i]` is equal to `lmn[i + 1]`, `lmx` is a list of 400010 elements, `rmn` is a shallow copy of the original `lmn`, `rmx` is a shallow copy of the original `lmx`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0.**
