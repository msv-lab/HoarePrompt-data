Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided code. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly reads the input from standard input, processes the number of black tokens, and their coordinates. It ensures that the input is handled according to the constraints specified in the problem description.

2. **Parity Division**: The program divides the black tokens into two sets based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates (`x + y`). This is a crucial step in the algorithm, as it helps in handling the different movement patterns of the tokens based on their parity.

3. **Coordinate Transformation**: The transformation of coordinates using `(-x + y, x + y)` is consistent with the problem's requirements. This transformation helps in simplifying the problem by aligning the movements in a way that makes it easier to compute the minimum and maximum reachable y-coordinates for each x-coordinate.

4. **Dynamic Programming and Range Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum and maximum reachable y-coordinates for each x-coordinate. It then combines this information to determine the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The logic handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

5. **Output**: The program prints the sum of the results from `func_1` for both sublists, which matches the expected output format and the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**: The output hints mention potential issues like handling invalid input, but the problem description guarantees valid input, so these edge cases are not relevant to the correctness of the program.

Given the above points, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
