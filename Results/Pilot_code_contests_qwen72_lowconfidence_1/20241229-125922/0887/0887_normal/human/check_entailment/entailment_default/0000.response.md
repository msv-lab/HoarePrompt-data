Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins if both players play optimally. However, there are several issues with the implementation that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Transformation of Coordinates**: The transformation `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` is used to map the original coordinates to a new range. This transformation is not symmetric and does not handle negative coordinates correctly. For example, if `x = -1`, the transformation results in `-1 - 1 = -2`, and `-2 / 2 = -1`, and `-1 + 100005 = 100004`. This can lead to incorrect indexing and incorrect calculations of the minimum and maximum `y` values.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where the input coordinates are at the boundaries of the allowed range. For example, if `x` is at the maximum value of 105, the transformation might result in an index out of bounds.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Values**: The way the minimum and maximum values are updated in the arrays `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` is not consistent. The updates are done in a way that might not reflect the correct minimum and maximum values for the entire range of transformed `x` values.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The final sum calculation `(lmx[i] - lmn[i]) / 2` assumes that the difference between `lmx[i]` and `lmn[i]` is always even, which might not be true for all cases. This can lead to incorrect results when the difference is odd.

5. **Parity Handling**: The function `func_2` splits the input coordinates based on the parity of `x + y`. This is a good approach, but the transformation and subsequent calculations in `func_1` need to be correct for both parities.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
