Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all aspects of the problem description effectively. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why I believe it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It processes the number of black tokens and their coordinates correctly.

2. **Data Preparation**: The program splits the black tokens into two lists based on the parity of the sum of their coordinates (x + y). This is done to handle the movement of the tokens more efficiently, as the parity of the sum of coordinates remains constant after each move.

3. **Coordinate Transformation**: The program transforms the coordinates to a range that fits within the array indices used for storing the minimum and maximum y-values for each x-value. This transformation ensures that the program can handle the given coordinate range efficiently.

4. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: The program uses arrays `lmn`, `lmx`, `rmn`, and `rmx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum y-values for each x-value, both from left to right and right to left. These arrays are updated to ensure that the values are propagated correctly across the entire range.

5. **Combining Results**: The program combines the results from the two lists (one for each parity) to calculate the total number of initial positions for the white token where the black player can win.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when there are no black tokens or when all black tokens are in the same position. It also handles the large input size and coordinate ranges specified in the problem description.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of various cases, the program seems to meet the requirements of the problem description. I could not find any specific input or edge case where the program would fail to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
