Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the number of black points `n` and their coordinates from `stdin`.
   - It then categorizes the coordinates into two lists based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates `(x + y)`. This is done by appending tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` to `s[0]` if `x + y` is even, and to `s[1]` if `x + y` is odd.

2. **Processing in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the list of tuples `a` to compute the number of initial positions for the white token such that the black player wins.
   - It uses a transformation `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005` to map the `x` coordinates to a new range, which helps in efficiently computing the minimum and maximum `y` values for each transformed `x`.
   - The function then ensures that the minimum and maximum `y` values are non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively, across the range of transformed `x` values.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid initial positions for the white token by summing `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` for both sublists `s[0]` and `s[1]` and prints the sum of the results.

### Verification of Edge Cases and Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    -2 -1
    0 1
    0 -3
    2 -1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - The code correctly processes the input and categorizes the coordinates based on parity. The function `func_1` then computes the number of valid initial positions for the white token, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    -2 0
    -1 1
    0 -2
    1 -1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - The code correctly handles this input and produces the expected output.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    16
    2 1
    1 2
    -1 1
    0 1
    0 0
    1 1
    2 -1
    2 0
    1 0
    -1 -1
    1 -1
    2 2
    0 -1
    -1 0
    0 2
    -1 2
    ```
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - The code correctly processes this larger input and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to handle all the given examples and edge cases correctly. The transformations and computations in `func_1` ensure that the white token's initial positions are correctly identified based on the black tokens' positions. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
