You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider the following game for two players. There is one white token and some number of black tokens. Each token is placed on a plane in a point with integer coordinates x and y.

The players take turn making moves, white starts. On each turn, a player moves all tokens of their color by 1 to up, down, left or right. Black player can choose directions for each token independently.

After a turn of the white player the white token can not be in a point where a black token is located. There are no other constraints on locations of the tokens: positions of black tokens can coincide, after a turn of the black player and initially the white token can be in the same point with some black point. If at some moment the white player can't make a move, he loses. If the white player makes 10100500 moves, he wins.

You are to solve the following problem. You are given initial positions of all black tokens. It is guaranteed that initially all these positions are distinct. In how many places can the white token be located initially so that if both players play optimally, the black player wins?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of black points.

The (i + 1)-th line contains two integers xi, yi ( - 105 ≤ xi, yi, ≤ 105) — the coordinates of the point where the i-th black token is initially located.

It is guaranteed that initial positions of black tokens are distinct.

Output

Print the number of points where the white token can be located initially, such that if both players play optimally, the black player wins.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of distinct tuples `(x, y)` where each coordinate is an integer within the range -105 to 105. It processes these coordinates to compute the minimum and maximum `y` values for each transformed `x` coordinate (using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`). The function then adjusts these minimum and maximum values to ensure they are non-decreasing and non-increasing, respectively, across the range of transformed `x` values. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of `(lmx[j] - lmn[j]) / 2` for all `j` from 0 to 200008 where `lmn[j] < lmx[j]`. If no such `j` exists, the function returns 0. The input list `a` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters directly. However, it reads input from stdin where the first line is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) representing the number of black points, followed by n lines each containing two integers x and y (-105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105) representing the coordinates of the black tokens. The coordinates are read into a list `dat` and processed to populate the list `s` which contains two sublists. Each sublist in `s` corresponds to the parity of the sum of the coordinates (x + y), and stores tuples (-x + y, x + y) for each black token.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 105 (inclusive), `i` is `n - 1`, `dat` is a map object converting input from `stdin` into integers, `s` is a list where `s[0]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is even, and `s[1]` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for all pairs `(x, y)` where `x + y` is odd.
    print(func_1(s[0]) + func_1(s[1]))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input (`stdin`) to process coordinates of black tokens. It expects the first line to contain an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) representing the number of black tokens, followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105) representing the coordinates of each token. The function populates a list `s` with two sublists based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates (`x + y`). Each sublist in `s` contains tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for the respective parity (even or odd). After processing the coordinates, the function calls `func_1` on both sublists and prints the sum of the results. The final state of the program is that the input has been fully consumed, and the sum of the results from `func_1` for both sublists has been printed to the standard output. Edge cases and potential issues include handling invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of coordinates) and ensuring that `func_1` is defined and behaves correctly.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
