Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the transformation of the coordinates and the subsequent processing in `func_1` do not fully capture the logic needed to determine the number of initial positions for the white token where the black player can force a win.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Coordinate Transformation and Parity Handling:**
   - The function `func_2` divides the coordinates into two lists based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates (`x + y`). This approach is intended to handle the movement of tokens in a way that simplifies the problem. However, the transformation and subsequent processing in `func_1` do not correctly account for all possible movements and configurations of the tokens.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum and Maximum Values:**
   - In `func_1`, the minimum and maximum `y` values are calculated for transformed `x` coordinates using the formula `(x - 1) / 2 + 100005`. This transformation is not clearly justified and may not accurately represent the original problem's constraints. The subsequent adjustments to these values (making them non-decreasing and non-increasing) and the final calculation of the answer may not correctly reflect the number of valid initial positions for the white token.

3. **Edge Cases and General Validity:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the black tokens are positioned in a way that creates complex configurations that the current logic might not correctly account for. For example, if the black tokens are arranged in a way that creates a more intricate pattern, the current logic might fail to identify all valid initial positions for the white token.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4
-2 0
-1 1
0 -2
1 -1
```
The expected output is `2`, but the provided code might produce a different result due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
