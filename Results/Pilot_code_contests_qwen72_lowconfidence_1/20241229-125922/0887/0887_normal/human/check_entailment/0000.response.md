Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. It processes the input to find the number of initial positions for the white token where the black player can guarantee a win. The program divides the tokens into two sets based on the parity of their sum of coordinates (x + y). For each set, it calculates the minimum and maximum reachable y-coordinates for each x-coordinate. It then combines this information to determine the number of valid starting positions for the white token. The logic handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the examples provided match the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
