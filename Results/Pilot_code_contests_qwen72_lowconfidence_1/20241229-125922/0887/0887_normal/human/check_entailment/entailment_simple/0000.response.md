Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of black points `n` and the coordinates of each black token from standard input.
   - It processes these coordinates to create a list `s` which contains two sublists. Each sublist in `s` corresponds to the parity of the sum of the coordinates (`x + y`). The sublists store tuples `(-x + y, x + y)` for each black token.

2. **Transformation and Aggregation:**
   - The program uses the transformation `x = (x - 1) / 2 + 100005` to map the x-coordinates into a range that fits within the array bounds.
   - It maintains two arrays `lmn` and `lmx` to track the minimum and maximum y-values for each x-coordinate, respectively.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Range Calculation:**
   - The program updates `lmn` and `lmx` to ensure they contain the minimum and maximum y-values for each x-coordinate, considering both left-to-right and right-to-left sweeps.
   - It then calculates the number of valid initial positions for the white token by iterating through the `lmn` and `lmx` arrays and counting the number of positions where `lmn[i] < lmx[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the results from processing the even and odd parity sublists, which gives the total number of valid initial positions for the white token.

### Why It Works:

- **Parity Handling:** By separating the black tokens into even and odd parity sublists, the program ensures that the white token's movement constraints are correctly handled. This is crucial because the white token's movement must avoid any black token's position after each move.
- **Range Calculation:** The dynamic programming approach used to update `lmn` and `lmx` ensures that the program correctly identifies the valid ranges for the white token's initial positions.
- **Correct Output:** The final output is the sum of the valid positions for both even and odd parity cases, which matches the problem's requirement to count all such positions.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Empty Input:** The problem guarantees that there will be at least one black token, so the program does not need to handle an empty input.
- **Large Inputs:** The program is designed to handle up to 105 black tokens, which is within the problem's constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
