Precondition: **The function does not take any parameters directly. However, it reads input from stdin where the first line is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) representing the number of black points, followed by n lines each containing two integers x and y (-105 ≤ x, y ≤ 105) representing the coordinates of the black tokens. The coordinates are read into a list `dat` and processed to populate the list `s` which contains two sublists. Each sublist in `s` corresponds to the parity of the sum of the coordinates (x + y), and stores tuples (-x + y, x + y) for each black token.**
