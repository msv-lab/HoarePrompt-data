To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs`; otherwise, it is `' '`.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs`; otherwise, it is `sys.stdout`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for x in args:` will iterate over the elements in the tuple `args`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must contain at least one element.

### States to Adjust:
- `args` must be a non-empty tuple. If `args` is empty, the loop will not execute.
- `x` will take the value of the first element in `args` when the loop starts.
- The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should be mentioned as part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `True`, `x` is the first element in `args`**
