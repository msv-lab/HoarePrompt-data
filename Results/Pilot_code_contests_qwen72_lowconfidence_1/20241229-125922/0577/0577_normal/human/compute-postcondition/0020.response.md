The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` performs the following actions:

1. It attempts to remove the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary and retrieve its value. If `'end'` is not in `kwargs`, it uses the default value `'\n'`.
2. It writes the retrieved value (or the default value) to the `file` object.

Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `kwargs`: The key `'end'` is removed from `kwargs` if it was present. If `'end'` was not in `kwargs`, `kwargs` remains unchanged.
- `file`: The value associated with `'end'` (or `'\n'` if `'end'` was not in `kwargs`) is written to `file`.

The other variables (`args`, `sep`, `file` (excluding the write operation), and `at_start`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'flush' with corresponding values (if 'end' was present, it is removed), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` (except before the first element) followed by the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` if `'end'` was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.**
