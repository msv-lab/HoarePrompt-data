Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by `sep` if `at_start` is `False`. If `at_start` is `False`, `file` will contain the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by `sep`, and `at_start` remains `False`. `x` is the second element in `args`.***
