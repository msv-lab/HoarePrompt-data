The code snippet sets `at_start` to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from `True` to `False`. No other variables are modified by this code.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of `x` appended to its content, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the first element in `args`.**
