Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` (except before the first element), `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.**
