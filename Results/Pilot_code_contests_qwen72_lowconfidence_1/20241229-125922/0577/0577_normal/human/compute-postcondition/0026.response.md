Functionality: ** The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` (where `n` > 1) and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` using a loop that increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any such prime, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, and it ensures that `n` is not divisible by any smaller prime before concluding that `n` is prime. **

### Summary of Function State After Execution:
- **Parameters:** The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer greater than 1.
- **Return Value:** The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
- **Final State:**
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
  - If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.
  - If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `False`.
  - If `n` is greater than 3 and not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the function returns `True`.
  - If `n` is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the function returns `False`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2 or 3, which are both prime numbers.
- The function ensures that `n` is not divisible by 2 or 3 before entering the loop, which optimizes the check for larger primes.
- The loop increments by 6 to skip non-prime candidates efficiently, ensuring that only potential prime divisors are checked.
- The function does not have any missing logic; it correctly implements the prime-checking algorithm for integers greater than 1.
