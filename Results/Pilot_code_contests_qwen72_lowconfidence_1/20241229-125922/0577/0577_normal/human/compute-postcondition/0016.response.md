Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of the third element in `args` followed by the value of `sep` if `at_start` is `False`. `at_start` remains `False`, and `x` is the third element in `args`.***
