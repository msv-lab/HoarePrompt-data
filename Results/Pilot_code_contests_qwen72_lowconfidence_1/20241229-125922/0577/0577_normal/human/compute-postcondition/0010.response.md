The code `file.write(sep)` appends the value of `sep` to the content of `file`. Given that `sep` is determined based on whether `'sep'` is in `kwargs` (if present, it's `kwargs['sep']`, otherwise it's `' '`), and `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and already contains the string representation of the second element in `args`.

Therefore, after executing `file.write(sep)`, the content of `file` will include the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`.

The other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `at_start`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by `sep`, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the second element in `args`.**
