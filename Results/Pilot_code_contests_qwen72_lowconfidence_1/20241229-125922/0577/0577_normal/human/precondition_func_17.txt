None of the variables in the function signature are provided; the function reads input directly. However, it is expected that the input conforms to the problem description: the first line should be an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), followed by t lines, each containing a string s consisting only of 'A' and 'B', with the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5.
