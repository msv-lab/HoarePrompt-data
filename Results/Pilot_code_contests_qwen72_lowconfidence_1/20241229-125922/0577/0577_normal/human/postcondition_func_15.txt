The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` (where `n` > 1) and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` using a loop that increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any such prime, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, and it ensures that `n` is not divisible by any smaller prime before concluding that `n` is prime.
