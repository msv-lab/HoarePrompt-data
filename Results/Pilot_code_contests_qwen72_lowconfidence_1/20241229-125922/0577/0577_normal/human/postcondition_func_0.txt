The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input a value. It then converts the input to an integer and returns this integer. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value based on the user's input, or it will have raised an exception if the input was invalid.
