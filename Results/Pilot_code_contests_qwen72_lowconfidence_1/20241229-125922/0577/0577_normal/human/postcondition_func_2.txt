The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain space-separated integers. The function then returns a map object that converts each of these space-separated strings into integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the behavior of the function is undefined and may result in a runtime error or an empty map object, respectively.
