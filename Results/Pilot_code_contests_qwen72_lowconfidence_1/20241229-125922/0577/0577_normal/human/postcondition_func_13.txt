The function `func_14` accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `p` where `p > 1` and `y` is a non-negative integer. It calculates and returns the result of `x^y % p`. After the function concludes, the value of `y` is 0, `res` contains the result of `x^y % p`, and `x` is updated to `x^(2^iterations) % p` where `iterations` is the number of times the loop executed. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1 as `x^0 % p` is always 1 for any non-zero `x`.
