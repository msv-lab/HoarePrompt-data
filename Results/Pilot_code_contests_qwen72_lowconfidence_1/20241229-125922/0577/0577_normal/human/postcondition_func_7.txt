The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted, along with a function `getKey` that is used to extract a comparison key from each element of the list. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the values returned by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `getKey` raises an exception for any element in `l`, the function will also raise an exception.
