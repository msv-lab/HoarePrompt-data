The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list with at least two elements, and returns the second element of `item`. If `item` has fewer than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not modify the input `item` and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the second element of `item` is returned, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the return value.
