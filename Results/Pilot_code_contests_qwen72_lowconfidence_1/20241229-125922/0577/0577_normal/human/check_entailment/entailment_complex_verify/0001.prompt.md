You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.

For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA → AABBA → AAA.

Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string s: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of s are either 'A' or 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (length of s) among all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.

Example

Input


3
AAA
BABA
AABBBABBBB


Output


3
2
0

Note

For the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is 3.

For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves is BABA → BA. So, the answer is 2.

For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves is AABBBABBBB → AABBBABB → AABBBB → ABBB → AB → (empty string). So, the answer is 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the `solve` function only removes occurrences of "AB" and "BB" but does not consider the possibility of "BA" being present in the string. According to the problem description, the substrings "AB" and "BB" can be removed, but the program does not account for "BA" which could potentially be part of a sequence that leads to further reductions.

For example, consider the input string "BABA":
- The program will remove "AB" to get "BA".
- However, "BA" can be further reduced to "B" by removing "AB" again.

The program will output 2 for "BABA", but the correct output should be 1.

This shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input a value. It then converts the input to an integer and returns this integer. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value based on the user's input, or it will have raised an exception if the input was invalid.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user input as a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input as a string. However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the user might provide no input or input that could cause issues (e.g., special characters, very large inputs). After the function executes, the program will have returned a string containing whatever the user entered, or an empty string if the user provided no input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and it is intended to read input from the standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element of the space-separated integers input from the standard input into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain space-separated integers. The function then returns a map object that converts each of these space-separated strings into integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the behavior of the function is undefined and may result in a runtime error or an empty map object, respectively.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used; the function reads input from the standard input.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns an iterator that yields each element from the input string split by spaces, with each element converted to a string. The input string is read from the standard input and any leading or trailing whitespace is removed before splitting.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from the standard input, trims any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the resulting string by spaces, and returns an iterator that yields each element as a string. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an iterator that yields no elements.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, thus there are no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The content of the list depends on the implementation of `func_3()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The content of the returned list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` raises an exception, `func_5` will also raise that exception. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable, `func_5` will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert it to a list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input variables are present in the function signature. This function appears to be setting up the environment for another function (`main`) to run, possibly handling large inputs or recursive calls by adjusting system limits and thread settings.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000 and the stack size for threads to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that targets the `main` function and starts this thread. The function itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the system limits are adjusted to handle large inputs or deep recursion, and a new thread is running the `main` function. If the `main` function throws an exception or if the system does not support setting the recursion limit or stack size, the behavior is undefined and may result in runtime errors.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list with at least two elements.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the tuple or list 'item'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list with at least two elements, and returns the second element of `item`. If `item` has fewer than two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not modify the input `item` and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the second element of `item` is returned, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the return value.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements that can be compared and sorted, and `getKey` is a function that takes an element of l as input and returns a value used for sorting.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, using the values returned by `getKey` for each element as the basis for comparison, and the list is sorted in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted, along with a function `getKey` that is used to extract a comparison key from each element of the list. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the values returned by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If `getKey` raises an exception for any element in `l`, the function will also raise an exception.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, and num is a value of any type.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, each element being the value of `num`. The outer list contains `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, all set to the value of `num`. 

- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- If `m` is 0, the function returns a list containing `n` empty lists.
- If both `n` and `m` are 0, the function returns an empty list.
- The function does not modify the input parameters and has no side effects.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns 0 if `x` is 0, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` if `x` is any other non-zero integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns a value based on the following conditions:
- It returns `0` if `x` is `0`.
- It returns `True` if `x` is a power of 2 (i.e., `x` is a positive integer and its binary representation contains exactly one '1').
- It returns `False` for all other non-zero integers. 

The function effectively checks if `x` is a power of 2 or not, with special handling for `0`. The state of the program after the function call is that the function has returned one of these three values based on the input `x`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of n as a string, without the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns "0". The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function handles positive and negative integers, converting them into a list of their digits. For example, `func_12(123)` returns `[1, 2, 3]` and `func_12(-456)` returns `[4, 5, 6]`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `[0]`. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, and passing such inputs would result in an error.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers where y is not zero.
def func_13(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the integer division result of x by y, which is an integer since x is divisible by y (i.e., x % y == 0)
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer division of x by y (which is not zero) plus 1, where x % y is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` takes two integers, `x` and `y` (where `y` is not zero), and returns an integer. If `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), it returns the integer division result of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`), it returns the integer division result of `x` by `y` plus 1. The function ensures that the returned value is always an integer, and it handles both cases where `x` is exactly divisible by `y` and where it is not.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and p are integers where p > 1, and y is a non-negative integer.
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is `x^y % p` where `x` and `y` are the original values, `x` is `x^(2^iterations) % p` where `iterations` is the number of times the loop executed, `p` is an integer greater than 1.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is calculated as `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the original values, and `p` is an integer greater than 1. Since `y` is 0, the calculation simplifies to `x^0 % p`, which results in 1 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `p` where `p > 1` and `y` is a non-negative integer. It calculates and returns the result of `x^y % p`. After the function concludes, the value of `y` is 0, `res` contains the result of `x^y % p`, and `x` is updated to `x^(2^iterations) % p` where `iterations` is the number of times the loop executed. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1 as `x^0 % p` is always 1 for any non-zero `x`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the value returned is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function returns 0, which can be considered the GCD of 0 and 0.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_16(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, not divisible by 2 or 3, and `n` is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of `n`. `i` is the smallest integer such that `i * i > n`. If `n` is divisible by any prime number `p` where `5 ≤ p ≤ sqrt(n)` and `p ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6)`, the program returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts an integer `n` (where `n` > 1) and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` using a loop that increments by 6. If `n` is divisible by any such prime, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is 2 or 3, and it ensures that `n` is not divisible by any smaller prime before concluding that `n` is prime.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem's input or output. This function is used for redirecting standard input and output to files and does not take any parameters related to the problem's context.
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Its primary purpose is to redirect the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. The function does not handle any potential errors, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could lead to runtime exceptions.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided; the function reads input directly. However, it is expected that the input conforms to the problem description: the first line should be an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000), followed by t lines, each containing a string s consisting only of 'A' and 'B', with the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_18():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = raw_input()
        
        func_19(solve(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20000, `s` is the last string read from the input, consisting only of 'A' and 'B', with the total length of all strings not exceeding 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function `solve(s)` has been called `t` times, and its result has been passed to `func_19` each time. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no calls to `solve(s)` or `func_19` are made.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which indicates the number of test cases. It then reads `t` lines, each containing a string `s` consisting only of 'A' and 'B'. For each string `s`, the function calls `solve(s)` and passes the result to `func_19`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes having processed `t` test cases, with each string `s` being passed through `solve` and the result being passed to `func_19`. If `t` is 0, no strings are read, and neither `solve` nor `func_19` are called. The function assumes that the input is well-formed according to the problem description, but it does not handle invalid input or edge cases such as empty strings or input lengths exceeding the specified limits.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def solve(s):
    if (s.find('AB') == -1 and s.find('BB') == -1) :
        return len(s)
        #The program returns the length of the string `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B', and does not contain the substrings 'AB' or 'BB'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The string s contains at least one occurrence of either 'AB' or 'BB'.
    while s.find('AB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('AB', '')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string with all 'AB' substrings removed, and if the original `s` contained 'AB' or 'BB', the resulting `s` will no longer contain 'AB' and may contain 'B' characters only if they were part of 'BB' sequences.
    while s.find('BB') != -1:
        s = s.replace('BB', '')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string with all 'AB' and 'BB' substrings removed, and `s` does not contain any 'BB' sequence.
    return len(s)
    #The program returns the length of string `s`, which is a non-empty string with all 'AB' and 'BB' substrings removed, and does not contain any 'BB' sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `solve` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It returns the length of `s` after removing all occurrences of the substrings 'AB' and 'BB'. If `s` initially does not contain 'AB' or 'BB', it simply returns the length of `s`. The final state of the string `s` is such that it no longer contains any 'AB' or 'BB' substrings. The function ensures that the resulting string `s` consists only of 'A' characters or is empty if all characters are removed.

#Function 20:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values of string, writable file object, string, and boolean respectively.
def func_19():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` (except before the first element), `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' with the corresponding value (if 'end' was present, it is removed). `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `' '`. `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if `'file'` was in `kwargs` otherwise it is `sys.stdout` and now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` (except before the first element) followed by the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` if `'end'` was not in `kwargs`. `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True` and this key has been removed from `kwargs` if it was present, then `file` has flushed its buffer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` prints the values of the provided positional arguments (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`). It accepts any number of positional arguments of any type and optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) which can include `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. The function writes the string representation of each argument to the output stream, separating them by the value of `sep` (defaulting to a space `' '`), and appends the value of `end` (defaulting to a newline `'\n'`) at the end. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output stream is flushed after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `args` tuple remains unchanged, and the `kwargs` dictionary may have the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` removed if they were present. The `file` object will contain the concatenated string representations of the `args` elements, separated by `sep` and terminated by `end`. If `flush` was `True`, the buffer of `file` will have been flushed.
