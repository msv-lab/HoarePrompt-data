You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Zookeeper is playing a game. In this game, Zookeeper must use bombs to bomb a string that consists of letters 'A' and 'B'. He can use bombs to bomb a substring which is either "AB" or "BB". When he bombs such a substring, the substring gets deleted from the string and the remaining parts of the string get concatenated.

For example, Zookeeper can use two such operations: AABABBA → AABBA → AAA.

Zookeeper wonders what the shortest string he can make is. Can you help him find the length of the shortest string?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each of the next t lines contains a single test case each, consisting of a non-empty string s: the string that Zookeeper needs to bomb. It is guaranteed that all symbols of s are either 'A' or 'B'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| (length of s) among all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the length of the shortest string that Zookeeper can make.

Example

Input


3
AAA
BABA
AABBBABBBB


Output


3
2
0

Note

For the first test case, you can't make any moves, so the answer is 3.

For the second test case, one optimal sequence of moves is BABA → BA. So, the answer is 2.

For the third test case, one optimal sequence of moves is AABBBABBBB → AABBBABB → AABBBB → ABBB → AB → (empty string). So, the answer is 0.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_18` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using the `solve` function.

2. **Solving Each Test Case**: The `solve` function handles the core logic:
   - It checks if the string `s` contains the substrings "AB" or "BB".
   - If neither "AB" nor "BB" is found, it returns the length of the string as no further reductions can be made.
   - It uses a loop to repeatedly remove occurrences of "AB" and "BB" until they no longer exist in the string.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the resulting string.

3. **Output**: The `func_19` function is used to print the results for each test case.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- **Empty String**: If the input string is empty, the function will return 0, which is correct.
- **String Without "AB" or "BB"**: If the input string does not contain "AB" or "BB", the function will return the length of the string, which is correct.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Potential Issues:
- **Efficiency**: The current implementation uses `str.replace`, which may not be the most efficient for very large strings. However, the problem constraints (sum of |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) suggest that this approach should be sufficient.
- **Thread Safety**: The use of `threading` in `func_6` is not relevant to the problem and can be ignored for this verification.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : The function `func_19` prints the values of the provided positional arguments (`args`) to a specified output stream (`file`). It accepts any number of positional arguments of any type and optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) which can include `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`. The function writes the string representation of each argument to the output stream, separating them by the value of `sep` (defaulting to a space `' '`), and appends the value of `end` (defaulting to a newline `'\n'`) at the end. If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the output stream is flushed after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `args` tuple remains unchanged, and the `kwargs` dictionary may have the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` removed if they were present. The `file` object will contain the concatenated string representations of the `args` elements, separated by `sep` and terminated by `end`. If `flush` was `True`, the buffer of `file` will have been flushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
