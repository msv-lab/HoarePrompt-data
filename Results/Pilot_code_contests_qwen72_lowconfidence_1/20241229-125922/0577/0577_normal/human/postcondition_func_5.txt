The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000 and the stack size for threads to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that targets the `main` function and starts this thread. The function itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the system limits are adjusted to handle large inputs or deep recursion, and a new thread is running the `main` function. If the `main` function throws an exception or if the system does not support setting the recursion limit or stack size, the behavior is undefined and may result in runtime errors.
