The function `solve` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It returns the length of `s` after removing all occurrences of the substrings 'AB' and 'BB'. If `s` initially does not contain 'AB' or 'BB', it simply returns the length of `s`. The final state of the string `s` is such that it no longer contains any 'AB' or 'BB' substrings. The function ensures that the resulting string `s` consists only of 'A' characters or is empty if all characters are removed.
