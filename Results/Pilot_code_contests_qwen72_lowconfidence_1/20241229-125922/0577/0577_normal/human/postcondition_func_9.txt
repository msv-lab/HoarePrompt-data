The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns a value based on the following conditions:
- It returns `0` if `x` is `0`.
- It returns `True` if `x` is a power of 2 (i.e., `x` is a positive integer and its binary representation contains exactly one '1').
- It returns `False` for all other non-zero integers. 

The function effectively checks if `x` is a power of 2 or not, with special handling for `0`. The state of the program after the function call is that the function has returned one of these three values based on the input `x`.
