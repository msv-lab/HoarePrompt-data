The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the value returned is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where either `x` or `y` is zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are zero, the function returns 0, which can be considered the GCD of 0 and 0.
