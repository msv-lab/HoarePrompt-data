The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input as a string. However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the user might provide no input or input that could cause issues (e.g., special characters, very large inputs). After the function executes, the program will have returned a string containing whatever the user entered, or an empty string if the user provided no input.
