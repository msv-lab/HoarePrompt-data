The function `func_17` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Its primary purpose is to redirect the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. The function does not handle any potential errors, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could lead to runtime exceptions.
