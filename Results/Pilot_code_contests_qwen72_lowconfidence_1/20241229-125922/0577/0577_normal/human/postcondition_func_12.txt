The function `func_13` takes two integers, `x` and `y` (where `y` is not zero), and returns an integer. If `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`), it returns the integer division result of `x` by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y != 0`), it returns the integer division result of `x` by `y` plus 1. The function ensures that the returned value is always an integer, and it handles both cases where `x` is exactly divisible by `y` and where it is not.
