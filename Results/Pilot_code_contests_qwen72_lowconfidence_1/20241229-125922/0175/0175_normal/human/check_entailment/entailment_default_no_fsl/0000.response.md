Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating a value `a` and using it to determine the winner of the game. However, there are issues with the logic used to determine the winner, particularly in how it handles the boundary conditions and the game's constraints.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `a`:**
   - The code calculates `a` as `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. This is an attempt to find the maximum number of moves a player can make along the diagonal. However, this calculation does not necessarily account for all possible moves that a player can make, especially when considering the Euclidean distance constraint.

2. **Boundary Condition Handling:**
   - The code uses a loop to adjust `a` to ensure that the token remains within the circle defined by `d`. However, the loop and the conditions inside it are not robust enough to handle all edge cases. Specifically, the condition `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` is not always correct and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Final Check:**
   - The final check `if ((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` is not a reliable way to determine the winner. It does not accurately reflect the game's rules and can lead to incorrect conclusions.

### Example Case:
- Consider the test case `d = 5` and `k = 2`.
  - The code calculates `a = floor(5 / (2 * 2 ** 0.5)) = floor(5 / 2.828) = 1`.
  - It then checks `(1 * 2) ** 2 + (2 * (1 + 1)) ** 2 > 5 ** 2`, which simplifies to `4 + 16 > 25`, which is false.
  - It then enters a loop and eventually appends 'Ashish'.
  - However, the correct answer for this case is 'Utkarsh', as Ashish cannot make a valid move after Utkarsh's first move.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
