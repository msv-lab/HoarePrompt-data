You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.

Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at (0,0). In one move a player must increase either the x coordinate or the y coordinate of the token by exactly k. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance d from (0,0).

In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are (p,q), then p^2 + q^2 ≤ d^2 must hold.

The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ d).

Output

For each test case, if Ashish wins the game, print "Ashish", otherwise print "Utkarsh" (without the quotes).

Example

Input


5
2 1
5 2
10 3
25 4
15441 33


Output


Utkarsh
Ashish
Utkarsh
Utkarsh
Ashish

Note

In the first test case, one possible sequence of moves can be

(0, 0) \xrightarrow{Ashish } (0, 1) \xrightarrow{Utkarsh } (0, 2).

Ashish has no moves left, so Utkarsh wins.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division,print_function
from heapq import*
import sys
from math import*

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, d and k are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d.
def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    af = []
    for i in range(int(le.pop())):
        d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        
        a = floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))
        
        if (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
            af.append('Utkarsh')
        else:
            while (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0:
                a -= 1
            if ((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
                af.append('Utkarsh')
            else:
                af.append('Ashish')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', `d` and `k` are the last integers read from `le`, `a` is the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2
    print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints a list of results. Each test case involves two integers, `d` and `k`, where `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ d`. For each test case, the function calculates a value `a` and determines whether a certain condition involving `a`, `d`, and `k` is met. If the condition is met, the result for that test case is 'Utkarsh'; otherwise, it is 'Ashish'. The function then prints the results for all test cases, one per line. After the function executes, the state of the program includes the following: `t` is an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, and `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish'. The variables `d` and `k` hold the values of the last test case processed, and `a` holds the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
