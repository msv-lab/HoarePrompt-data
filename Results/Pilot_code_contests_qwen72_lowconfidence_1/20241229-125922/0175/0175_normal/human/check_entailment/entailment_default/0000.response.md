Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating a value `a` and using it to determine the winner of the game. However, the logic used to calculate `a` and the subsequent conditions to determine the winner are flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Specifically, the code calculates `a` as `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))` and then checks a condition involving `a`, `d`, and `k`. This approach does not correctly capture the optimal strategy for the game. The game's rules require that the token stays within a Euclidean distance `d` from the origin, and the optimal strategy involves making moves that maximize the number of available moves for the opponent.

A more accurate approach would involve simulating the game or using a mathematical insight to determine the winner. For example, the game can be analyzed by considering the maximum number of moves each player can make before the token exceeds the distance `d`.

Here is a case where the code fails:

- **Test Case**: `d = 10`, `k = 3`
- **Expected Output**: `Utkarsh`
- **Actual Output**: `Ashish`

For this test case, the code incorrectly determines that Ashish wins, while the correct winner is Utkarsh. The optimal strategy for this case would show that Utkarsh can force Ashish into a position where no valid moves are left, but the code does not correctly simulate this scenario. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
