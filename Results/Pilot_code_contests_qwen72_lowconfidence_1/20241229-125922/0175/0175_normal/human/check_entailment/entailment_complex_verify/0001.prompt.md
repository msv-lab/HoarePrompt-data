You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.

Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at (0,0). In one move a player must increase either the x coordinate or the y coordinate of the token by exactly k. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance d from (0,0).

In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are (p,q), then p^2 + q^2 ≤ d^2 must hold.

The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ d).

Output

For each test case, if Ashish wins the game, print "Ashish", otherwise print "Utkarsh" (without the quotes).

Example

Input


5
2 1
5 2
10 3
25 4
15441 33


Output


Utkarsh
Ashish
Utkarsh
Utkarsh
Ashish

Note

In the first test case, one possible sequence of moves can be

(0, 0) \xrightarrow{Ashish } (0, 1) \xrightarrow{Utkarsh } (0, 2).

Ashish has no moves left, so Utkarsh wins.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Mathematical Logic**: The program calculates the maximum number of moves (`a`) that can be made while keeping the token within the distance `d` using the formula `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. This is derived from the condition \( p^2 + q^2 \leq d^2 \).

3. **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the next move would exceed the distance `d` and determines the winner based on this condition. Specifically:
   - If \((a \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 1))^2 > d^2\), then Utkarsh wins because Ashish cannot make a valid move.
   - Otherwise, it further checks if \(((a + 1) \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 2))^2 > d^2\) and adjusts `a` accordingly to ensure the correct winner is determined.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `d` is very small or when `k` is close to `d`, ensuring that the game logic is followed correctly.

Given these points, the program seems to cover all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, d and k are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d.
def func():
    le = sys.__stdin__.read().split('\n')[::-1]
    af = []
    for i in range(int(le.pop())):
        d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
        
        a = floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))
        
        if (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
            af.append('Utkarsh')
        else:
            while (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0:
                a -= 1
            if ((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
                af.append('Utkarsh')
            else:
                af.append('Ashish')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', `d` and `k` are the last integers read from `le`, `a` is the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2
    print('\n'.join(map(str, af)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints a list of results. Each test case involves two integers, `d` and `k`, where `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ d`. For each test case, the function calculates a value `a` and determines whether a certain condition involving `a`, `d`, and `k` is met. If the condition is met, the result for that test case is 'Utkarsh'; otherwise, it is 'Ashish'. The function then prints the results for all test cases, one per line. After the function executes, the state of the program includes the following: `t` is an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, and `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish'. The variables `d` and `k` hold the values of the last test case processed, and `a` holds the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
