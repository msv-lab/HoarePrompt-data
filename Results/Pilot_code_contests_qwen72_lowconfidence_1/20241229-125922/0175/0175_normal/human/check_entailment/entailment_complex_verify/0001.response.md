Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The annotated code confirms that `le` is a list of lines from the input, and it processes each test case correctly.

2. **Mathematical Logic**: The program calculates the maximum number of moves (`a`) that can be made while keeping the token within the distance `d` using the formula `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. This is derived from the condition \( p^2 + q^2 \leq d^2 \). The annotated code shows that `a` is calculated correctly and used in subsequent checks.

3. **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the next move would exceed the distance `d` and determines the winner based on this condition. Specifically:
   - If \((a \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 1))^2 > d^2\), then Utkarsh wins because Ashish cannot make a valid move.
   - Otherwise, it further checks if \(((a + 1) \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 2))^2 > d^2\) and adjusts `a` accordingly to ensure the correct winner is determined.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `d` is very small or when `k` is close to `d`, ensuring that the game logic is followed correctly. The annotated code confirms that the program adjusts `a` appropriately to ensure the correct winner is determined.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for all test cases, one per line, as required by the problem statement. The annotated code confirms that `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', and the results are printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis and the confirmation from the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
