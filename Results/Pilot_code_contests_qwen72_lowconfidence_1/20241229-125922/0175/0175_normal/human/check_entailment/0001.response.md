Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Mathematical Logic**: The program calculates the maximum number of moves (`a`) that can be made while keeping the token within the distance `d` using the formula `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. This is derived from the condition \( p^2 + q^2 \leq d^2 \).

3. **Winning Condition Check**: The program checks if the next move would exceed the distance `d` and determines the winner based on this condition. Specifically:
   - If \((a \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 1))^2 > d^2\), then Utkarsh wins because Ashish cannot make a valid move.
   - Otherwise, it further checks if \(((a + 1) \cdot k)^2 + (k \cdot (a + 2))^2 > d^2\) and adjusts `a` accordingly to ensure the correct winner is determined.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `d` is very small or when `k` is close to `d`, ensuring that the game logic is followed correctly.

Given these points, the program seems to cover all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
