You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.

Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at (0,0). In one move a player must increase either the x coordinate or the y coordinate of the token by exactly k. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance d from (0,0).

In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are (p,q), then p^2 + q^2 ≤ d^2 must hold.

The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ d).

Output

For each test case, if Ashish wins the game, print "Ashish", otherwise print "Utkarsh" (without the quotes).

Example

Input


5
2 1
5 2
10 3
25 4
15441 33


Output


Utkarsh
Ashish
Utkarsh
Utkarsh
Ashish

Note

In the first test case, one possible sequence of moves can be

(0, 0) \xrightarrow{Ashish } (0, 1) \xrightarrow{Utkarsh } (0, 2).

Ashish has no moves left, so Utkarsh wins.
