The code snippet provided appends the string 'Ashish' to the list `af`. The initial state indicates that `af` is an empty list, so after executing this code, `af` will contain one element, which is the string 'Ashish'. The other variables (`t`, `d`, `k`, `le`, `i`, `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `le` is a list with one less element, `af` is ['Ashish'], `i` is 0, `a` is the largest integer such that `(a * k)`**
