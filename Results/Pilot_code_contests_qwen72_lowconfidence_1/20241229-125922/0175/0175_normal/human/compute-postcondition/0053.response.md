Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 \leq d^2\) or `a` is 0. If \(((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2\), `af` now includes 'Utkarsh'. Otherwise, `af` is a list that now includes 'Ashish' as its last element.***
