To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     1. \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 > d^2\)
     2. \(a > 0\)

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `le` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped.
   - `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **Condition 1**: \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 > d^2\)
     - This condition involves `a`, `k`, and `d`.
     - For this condition to be true, the values of `a`, `k`, and `d` must be such that the inequality holds.
   - **Condition 2**: \(a > 0\)
     - This condition requires that `a` must be greater than 0.

### Analysis of Condition 1:
- Let's rewrite the inequality:
  \[
  (a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 > d^2
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  (a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 = (a * k)^2 + (k * a + 2 * k)^2
  \]
  \[
  = (a * k)^2 + (k * a + 2 * k)^2 = (a * k)^2 + (k^2 * a^2 + 4 * k^2 * a + 4 * k^2)
  \]
  \[
  = a^2 * k^2 + k^2 * a^2 + 4 * k^2 * a + 4 * k^2
  \]
  \[
  = 2 * a^2 * k^2 + 4 * k^2 * a + 4 * k^2
  \]
  \[
  = 2 * k^2 * (a^2 + 2 * a + 2)
  \]
  So, the inequality becomes:
  \[
  2 * k^2 * (a^2 + 2 * a + 2) > d^2
  \]

### Ensuring \(a > 0\):
- For \(a\) to be greater than 0, the initial value of `a` must be positive. Given that `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`, we need:
  \[
  \frac{d}{k * \sqrt{2}} > 0
  \]
  This implies that `d` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once:
  - `a` must be greater than 0, which means `d` and `k` must be positive.
  - The inequality \(2 * k^2 * (a^2 + 2 * a + 2) > d^2\) must hold.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` is a list with at least one fewer element.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped.
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))` and must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))` and must be greater than 0.**
