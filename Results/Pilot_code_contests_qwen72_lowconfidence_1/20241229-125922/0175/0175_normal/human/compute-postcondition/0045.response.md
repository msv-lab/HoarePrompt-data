The value of `a` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`. After decrementing, the new value of `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`, and `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 1`.
