To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the initial conditions:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `d` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d.
   - `le` is a list containing the lines of input in reverse order.
   - `af` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(le.pop())`.

3. **Requirements for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(le.pop())` returns a positive integer.
   - This means `le` must contain at least one element that can be popped and converted to an integer.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `le` contains at least one element.
   - Ensure the element popped from `le` can be converted to a positive integer.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `le` is not empty and its first element (which will be popped) is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d, `le` is a list containing at least one element that is a string representing a positive integer, `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
