To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
   - This condition involves the variables `a`, `k`, and `d`.
   - We need to ensure that this inequality holds true for the next iteration.

2. **Condition 2: `a > 0`**
   - This condition ensures that `a` is positive.
   - After the previous iteration, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` is a list with at least one fewer element.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped.
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Adjust `a` to Ensure `a > 0`**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still be positive.
   - Since `a` is currently `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`, we need to ensure that `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1 > 0`.
   - This implies `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 1`.

2. **Ensure the Inequality Condition Holds**:
   - We need to ensure that `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` holds true.
   - Given that `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`, we need to check if this value satisfies the inequality.
   - This condition is more complex and depends on the values of `d` and `k`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `a` must be positive, which means `floor(d / (k * 2))` must be greater than 1.
- The inequality condition should hold true, but without specific values of `d` and `k`, we cannot adjust it directly.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1` and `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 1`**.
