Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `k` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)\), and the condition \(((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2\) is true.**
