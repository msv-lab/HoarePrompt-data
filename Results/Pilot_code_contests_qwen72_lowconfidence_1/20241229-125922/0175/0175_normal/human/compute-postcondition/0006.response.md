The code snippet `af.append('Utkarsh')` adds the string 'Utkarsh' to the list `af`. Since `af` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `af` contains the single element 'Utkarsh'. The other variables (`t`, `d`, `k`, `le`, `i`, `a`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed), `af` is a list containing ['Utkarsh'], `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`**
