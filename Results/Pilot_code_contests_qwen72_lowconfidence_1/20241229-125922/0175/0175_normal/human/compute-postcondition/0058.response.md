Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints a list of results. Each test case involves two integers, `d` and `k`, where `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ d`. For each test case, the function calculates a value `a` and determines whether a certain condition involving `a`, `d`, and `k` is met. If the condition is met, the result for that test case is 'Utkarsh'; otherwise, it is 'Ashish'. The function then prints the results for all test cases, one per line. After the function executes, the state of the program includes the following: `t` is an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, and `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish'. The variables `d` and `k` hold the values of the last test case processed, and `a` holds the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input is not formatted correctly (e.g., missing lines or invalid integers), the function may raise an exception.
- The function assumes that the input will always contain exactly `t` test cases, and it does not handle cases where the number of lines in the input is less than `t`.
- The function does not validate the constraints on `d` and `k` beyond the initial check, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is out of bounds.
- The function does not handle cases where `d` or `k` are zero or negative, even though the constraints specify they should be positive integers.
