Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `k` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)\). If \(((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2\), then `af` is a list that now includes 'Utkarsh'. Otherwise, `af` is a list that now ends with the string 'Ashish'.***
