To determine if the loop can execute, we need to evaluate the condition `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0`. Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`
2. **Condition 2:** `a > 0`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `le` is a list with at least one less element.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le`.
   - `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`.

2. **Condition 2 Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than 0. Given that `a = floor(d / (k * 2))`, `d / (k * 2)` must be greater than 0. This implies that `d` must be positive and `k` must be positive.

3. **Condition 1 Analysis:**
   - We need to ensure that `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`.
   - Let's simplify this:
     - `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 = (a * k) ** 2 + (k * a + 2 * k) ** 2`
     - `= (a * k) ** 2 + (k * a + 2 * k) ** 2`
     - `= (a * k) ** 2 + (k * a) ** 2 + 4 * k * a * k + (2 * k) ** 2`
     - `= (a * k) ** 2 + (a * k) ** 2 + 4 * k ** 2 * a + 4 * k ** 2`
     - `= 2 * (a * k) ** 2 + 4 * k ** 2 * a + 4 * k ** 2`
     - `= 2 * a ** 2 * k ** 2 + 4 * k ** 2 * a + 4 * k ** 2`
     - `= 2 * k ** 2 * (a ** 2 + 2 * a + 2)`
   - We need this to be greater than `d ** 2`.

Given that `a = floor(d / (k * 2))`, we need to ensure that `d` and `k` are such that the inequality holds true. Since `a` is derived from `d` and `k`, and `a` must be greater than 0, `d` must be greater than `2 * k`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need:
- `d` to be greater than `2 * k` to make `a` greater than 0.
- The values of `d` and `k` should be such that the inequality `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` holds true.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than `2 * k`, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))` and `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
