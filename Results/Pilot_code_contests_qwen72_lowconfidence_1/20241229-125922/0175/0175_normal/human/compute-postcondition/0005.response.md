Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed), `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`. The condition `((a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2)` holds true.***
