The value of `a` is calculated using the formula `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. The values of `t`, `d`, `k`, `le`, `af`, and `i` remain unchanged. The specific value of `a` depends on the values of `d` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed), `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`**
