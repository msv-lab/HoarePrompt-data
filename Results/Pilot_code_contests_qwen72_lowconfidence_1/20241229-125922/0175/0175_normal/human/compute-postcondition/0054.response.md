Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`. If \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 1))^2 > d^2\), then `af` includes the element 'Utkarsh'. Otherwise, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 \leq d^2\) or `a` is 0.***
