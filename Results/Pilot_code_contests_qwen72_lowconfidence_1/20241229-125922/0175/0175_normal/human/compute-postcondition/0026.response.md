The value of `a` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `a` was `floor(d / (k * 2))`, so the new value of `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than `2 * k`, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 1`, and `(a * k)`**
