The code snippet `af.append('Utkarsh')` adds the string `'Utkarsh'` to the list `af`. The values of `t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `af` is a list, appending `'Utkarsh'` to it modifies the list but does not affect other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before execution, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)), `af` is a list containing 'Utkarsh'**
