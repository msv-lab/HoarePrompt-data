The code snippet provided is:
```
af.append('Utkarsh')
```

This code appends the string `'Utkarsh'` to the list `af`. The initial state mentions several variables (`t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, `k`, and `a`), but does not explicitly mention the existence or state of the list `af`. Assuming `af` is a list (as appending to it is a valid operation), the only change in state due to this code is the addition of `'Utkarsh'` to the list `af`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the unchanged variables and the new state of `af`, is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `k` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)\), and the condition \(((a + 1) * k) is not satisfied, `af` is a list that now includes 'Utkarsh'**.
