To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`
2. `a > 0`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
   - This condition checks if the sum of two squared terms is greater than the square of `d`.
   - The terms are `(a * k) ** 2` and `(k * (a + 2)) ** 2`.

2. **Condition 2: `a > 0`**
   - This condition ensures that `a` is positive.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`)
- `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`)
- `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed)
- `af` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`

### Adjustments Needed:

1. **Ensure `a > 0`**:
   - Since `a = floor(d / (k * 2))`, we need to ensure that `d / (k * 2)` is greater than 0. This means `d` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be positive.
   - Therefore, `d` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be positive.

2. **Ensure `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**:
   - We need to ensure that the left side of the inequality is greater than the right side.
   - Let's simplify the left side:
     \[
     (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 = a^2 * k^2 + (a + 2)^2 * k^2 = k^2 * (a^2 + (a + 2)^2)
     \]
   - Expanding `(a + 2)^2`:
     \[
     (a + 2)^2 = a^2 + 4a + 4
     \]
   - So the left side becomes:
     \[
     k^2 * (a^2 + a^2 + 4a + 4) = k^2 * (2a^2 + 4a + 4)
     \]
   - The inequality becomes:
     \[
     k^2 * (2a^2 + 4a + 4) > d^2
     \]

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- `d` must be greater than 0.
- `k` must be positive.
- The inequality \( k^2 * (2a^2 + 4a + 4) > d^2 \) must hold true.

Given the initial state, the adjustments needed are:
- Ensure `d > 0`.
- Ensure `k > 0`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed), `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`**.
