To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
   - This condition checks if the sum of two squared terms is greater than the square of `d`.
   - The terms are:
     - `(a * k) ** 2`
     - `(k * (a + 2)) ** 2`
   - For the loop to execute again, this inequality must hold true.

2. **Condition 2: `a > 0`**
   - This condition ensures that `a` is positive.
   - Since `a` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `a` remains positive for the next iteration.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `le` is a list with at least one less element
- `i` is 0
- `d` is greater than `2 * k`
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Condition 2: `a > 0`**
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `a` is currently `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`, we need to ensure that `a` is still positive after the decrement.
   - Therefore, `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2 > 0` must hold true.
   - Simplifying, `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 2`.

2. **Condition 1: `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
   - We need to ensure that this inequality holds true for the current value of `a`.
   - Given that `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`, we need to check if:
     - `((floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2) * k) ** 2 + (k * ((floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2 + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`
   - Simplifying, this becomes:
     - `((floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2) * k) ** 2 + (k * floor(d / (k * 2))) ** 2 > d ** 2`
   - This inequality must hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `a` must be greater than 0, which means `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 2`.
- The inequality `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` must hold true with `a = floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions are met. However, since the conditions are already given and the values are consistent with the loop requirements, no further adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring that `a` remains positive.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is greater than `2 * k`, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2` and `floor(d / (k * 2)) > 2`**
