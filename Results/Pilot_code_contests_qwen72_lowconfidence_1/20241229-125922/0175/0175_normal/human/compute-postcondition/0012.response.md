To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is a positive integer
- `le` is a list with one less element
- `af` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`
- `d` must be such that `d >= k * 2` and `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`**
   - This condition checks if the sum of two squared terms is greater than the square of `d`.
   - We need to ensure that this inequality holds true for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition 2: `a > 0`**
   - This condition checks if `a` is positive.
   - Since `a` is defined as `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`, we need to ensure that `a` remains positive.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`a`**: For `a` to remain positive, `floor(d / (k * 2))` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `d / (k * 2)` must be greater than 2, which implies `d > 4 * k`.

- **`d`**: To satisfy the first condition, we need to ensure that `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`. Given that `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`, we need to adjust `d` such that the inequality holds true. This typically means increasing `d` to ensure the inequality is maintained.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the following states:
- `d` must be greater than `4 * k` to ensure `a` remains positive.
- The inequality `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2` must hold true, which might require increasing `d` further.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is greater than `4 * k` and `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `le` is a list with one less element, `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)) - 2`**
