Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before execution, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2)). If \((a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2\), `af` is a list containing 'Utkarsh'. Otherwise, `af` is not modified, and `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 \leq d ** 2\).***
