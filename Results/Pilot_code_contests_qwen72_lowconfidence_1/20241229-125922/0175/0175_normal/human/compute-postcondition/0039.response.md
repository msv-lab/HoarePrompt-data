The code snippet `d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))` performs the following actions:
- It removes the last element from the list `le`.
- This element is split into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter.
- These two parts are converted to integers and assigned to `d` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` and `k` are integers derived from the new last element of `le`.
- `a` is `floor(new_d / (new_k * 2))`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `le` is removed.
- `d` and `k` are assigned the integer values from the split elements of the removed last element of `le`.
- `a` is updated to `floor(d / (k * 2))`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`.**
