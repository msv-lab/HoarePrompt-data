The code `af.append('Utkarsh')` adds the string `'Utkarsh'` to the list `af`. The list `af` was initially empty, so after this operation, `af` contains one element, which is the string `'Utkarsh'`.

The other variables (`t`, `d`, `k`, `le`, `i`, `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `le` is a list with one less element, `af` is a list containing ['Utkarsh'], `i` is 0, `a` is the largest integer such that `(a * k)` and `((a + 1) * k)`**.
