The provided code snippet `af.append('Utkarsh')` adds the string 'Utkarsh' to the list `af`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `af`, we can only state that 'Utkarsh' has been added to this list. The other variables (`t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 \leq d^2\) or `a` is 0, and the current value of `a` satisfies the condition \(((a + 1) * k), `af` now includes 'Utkarsh'.**
