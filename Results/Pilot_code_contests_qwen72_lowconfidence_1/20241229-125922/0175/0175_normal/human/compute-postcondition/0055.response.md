To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and understand how the variables change with each iteration. Let's break down the process step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `d` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d.
- `le` is a list containing the lines of input in reverse order.
- `af` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(int(le.pop())):
    d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))
    a = floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))
    if (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
        af.append('Utkarsh')
    else:
        while (a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2 and a > 0:
            a -= 1
        if ((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2:
            af.append('Utkarsh')
        else:
            af.append('Ashish')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `int(le.pop())` times. This means the loop will run a number of times equal to the integer value of the last element in `le` when the loop starts.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `le.pop()` removes the last element from `le` and returns its integer value, which determines the number of iterations.
   - Inside the loop, `d` and `k` are updated by popping the next element from `le` and splitting it into two integers.
   - `a` is calculated as `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`.
   - Depending on the conditions involving `a`, `d`, and `k`, either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish' is appended to `af`.

### Output State:
- After the loop completes, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` will have `t` fewer elements than it did initially because `le.pop()` is called `t` times.
- `af` will contain `t` elements, each being either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish'.
- The values of `d` and `k` will be the last values read from `le` before the loop ends.
- `a` will be the last calculated value of `a` based on the final `d` and `k`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', `d` and `k` are the last integers read from `le`, `a` is the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`.**
