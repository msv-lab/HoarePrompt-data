To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `d` and `k` are integers (specific values depend on the content of the last element in `le`).
- `le` is a list with one less element.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(le.pop())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `le`**: The list `le` is modified by the `pop()` method inside the `range()` function. This means that at the start of each iteration, the last element of `le` is removed and converted to an integer to determine the number of iterations for the current loop.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop counter and is incremented from 0 to the value of `int(le.pop()) - 1`.
3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `le` and the popped element is greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`le`**: After the previous iteration, the last element of `le` was popped. For the loop to execute again, `le` must still have at least one element.
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be reset to 0.
- **`d` and `k`**: These values depend on the content of the last element in `le` before it is popped. Since the last element is popped, `d` and `k` will be recalculated based on the new last element of `le`.
- **`a`**: `a` is calculated as `floor(d / (k * 2))`. Since `d` and `k` change, `a` will also be recalculated.

### Final State:
- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `le` must have at least one element for the loop to execute again.
- `i` is reset to 0.
- `d` and `k` are recalculated based on the new last element of `le`.
- `a` is recalculated based on the new values of `d` and `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers (specific values depend on the content of the last element in `le`), `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`.**
