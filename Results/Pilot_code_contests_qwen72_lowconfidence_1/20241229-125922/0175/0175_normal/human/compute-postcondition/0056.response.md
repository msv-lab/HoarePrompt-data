The code prints each element of the list `af`, which contains either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', on a new line. The values of `t`, `le`, `af`, `d`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as the code only affects the output and does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with `t` fewer elements than it had initially, `af` is a list of length `t` containing either 'Utkarsh' or 'Ashish', `d` and `k` are the last integers read from `le`, `a` is the last calculated value of `floor(d / (k * 2))`.**
