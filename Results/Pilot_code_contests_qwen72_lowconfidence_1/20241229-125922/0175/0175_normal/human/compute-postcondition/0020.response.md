Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` and `k` are integers (specific values depend on the content of the last element in `le`), `le` is a list with one less element, `i` is 0, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`. If `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 > d ** 2`, then `af` is a list containing ['Utkarsh']. Otherwise, `af` remains an empty list and `a` is the largest integer such that `(a * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 1)) ** 2 <= d ** 2`.***
