The line of code `d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))` performs the following actions:

1. It pops the last element from the list `le`.
2. Splits the popped string into a list of substrings based on spaces.
3. Converts each substring into an integer.
4. Unpacks the resulting list of integers into the variables `d` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d
- `le` is a list containing at least one element that is a string representing a positive integer
- `af` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

After executing the code, the output state will be:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`)
- `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`)
- `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed)
- `af` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `k` is an integer (specific value depends on the content of the last element in `le`), `le` is a list with one less element (the last element has been removed), `af` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
