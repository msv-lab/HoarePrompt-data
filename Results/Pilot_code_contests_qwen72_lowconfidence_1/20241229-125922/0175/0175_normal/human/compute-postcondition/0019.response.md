Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `le` is a list with one less element, `i` is 0, `a` is the largest integer such that `(a * k)`. If `((a + 1) * k) ** 2 + (k * (a + 2)) ** 2 > d ** 2`, then `af` is a list containing `['Utkarsh']`. Otherwise, `af` is a list containing `['Ashish']`.***
