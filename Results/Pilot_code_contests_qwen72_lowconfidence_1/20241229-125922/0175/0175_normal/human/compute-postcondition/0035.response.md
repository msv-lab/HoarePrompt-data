The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
af.append('Ashish')
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code on the program state:

- The code appends the string `'Ashish'` to the list `af`.
- The initial state mentions several variables (`t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, `k`, `a`), but does not mention `af`. We assume `af` is a list (since `.append()` is a method applicable to lists).
- Since the initial state does not specify the initial content of `af`, we only know that after the execution, `af` contains `'Ashish'` as its last element.

Therefore, the updated state reflects that `af` now includes `'Ashish'` as an additional element at the end. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `k` is the same as derived from the last element of `le`, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)\), and \(((a + 1) * k), `af` is a list that now ends with the string 'Ashish'**.
