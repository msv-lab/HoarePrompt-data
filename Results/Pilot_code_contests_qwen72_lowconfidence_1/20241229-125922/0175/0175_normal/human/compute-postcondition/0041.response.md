The code snippet provided appends the string 'Utkarsh' to the list `af`.

1. **Variables Affected**:
   - `af`: The list `af` now includes an additional element, 'Utkarsh'.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The list `af` is modified by appending the string 'Utkarsh' to it.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped.
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`.

After executing the code:
- `af` now contains the additional element 'Utkarsh'.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2 ** 0.5))`, `af` includes the element 'Utkarsh'.**
