The code initializes an empty list named `af`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `d`, `k`, or `le`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ d, `le` is a list containing the lines of input in reverse order, `af` is an empty list**
