The code snippet `d, k = list(map(int, le.pop().split()))` extracts the last element from the list `le`, splits it into two parts (assuming the element is a string with two numbers separated by a space), converts these parts to integers, and assigns them to `d` and `k`, respectively. This also removes the last element from `le`.

Let's consider the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `le` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` and `k` are integers (specific values depend on the content of the last element in `le`).
- `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`.

After executing the code snippet, the changes are:
- `d` and `k` are updated to the integer values extracted from the last element of `le`.
- The last element is removed from `le`.

The values of `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `a` will be recalculated based on the new values of `d` and `k` if this calculation is performed again.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one less element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are integers derived from the last element of `le` before execution, `a` is `floor(d / (k * 2))`**.
