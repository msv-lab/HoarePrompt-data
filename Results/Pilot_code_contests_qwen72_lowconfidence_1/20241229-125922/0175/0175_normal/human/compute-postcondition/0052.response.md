The code snippet provided is:

```python
af.append('Ashish')
```

This code appends the string `'Ashish'` to the list `af`. The initial state does not specify what `af` is, but since we are appending to it, we can infer that `af` is a list. All other variables (`t`, `le`, `i`, `d`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `le` is a list with at least one fewer element, `i` is 0, `d` and `k` are positive integers derived from the last element of `le` before it was popped, `a` is the largest integer such that \((a * k)^2 + (k * (a + 2))^2 \leq d^2\) or `a` is 0, and `af` is a list that now includes 'Ashish' as its last element.**
