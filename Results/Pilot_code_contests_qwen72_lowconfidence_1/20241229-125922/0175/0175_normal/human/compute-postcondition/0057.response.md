The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `d`, and `k`. The parameter `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, and `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ d. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value from the information given. However, typically, such a function would perform some operation based on these parameters and return a result.

For the purpose of this task, let's assume the function returns a value based on the parameters provided. Without specific details on the output, I will generalize the description:

The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `d`, and `k`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^5, and `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ d. The function returns a value based on these parameters.
