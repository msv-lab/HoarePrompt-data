The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the user input, which is split into two integers. The values of `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `t`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxx` is `-10`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is \(10^{18}\), `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers**
