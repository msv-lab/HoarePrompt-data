The code snippet `maxy = max(maxy, b)` updates the value of `maxy` to the maximum between its current value and `b`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`
- `minx` is `min(10, a)`
- `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`
- `t` is greater than 2
- `z` is 2
- `a` and `b` are integers from input
- `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`

Since `maxy` was already defined as the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`, the line `maxy = max(maxy, b)` will not change the value of `maxy` because `maxy` is already the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for all variables except that the value of `maxy` is explicitly confirmed to be the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`.

Output State: **`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(10, a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers from input, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
