The variables `maxx` and `maxy` are initialized to `-10 ** 18`. The initial state mentions that the function `func` is expected to take a list of tuples as input, and `t` is an input integer. These parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a mine. The list has a length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. All coordinates are distinct. `t` is an input integer. `maxx` is `-10 ** 18`, `maxy` is `-10 ** 18`.**
