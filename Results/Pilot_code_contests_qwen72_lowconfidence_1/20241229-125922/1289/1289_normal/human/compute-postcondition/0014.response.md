The code snippet `maxy = max(maxy, b)` updates the value of `maxy` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`
- `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`
- `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `z` is 1
- `a` and `b` are new input integers
- `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`

The impact of the code on the program:
- `maxy` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `b`.
- The current value of `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`.
- Therefore, `maxy` remains the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**.
