The value of `t` is assigned the integer conversion of the user input through `raw_input()`. The function `func` and its expected parameters remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding the function `func` and the constraints on the input list of tuples are still valid.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a mine. The list has a length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. All coordinates are distinct. `t` is an input integer.**
