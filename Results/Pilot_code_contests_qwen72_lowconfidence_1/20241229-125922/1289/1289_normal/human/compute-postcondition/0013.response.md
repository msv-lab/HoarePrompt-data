The value of `minx` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`min(10, a)`) and the new value of `a`. 

Since `a` is already part of the expression `min(10, a)`, the new value of `minx` will be the minimum of these two values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**.
