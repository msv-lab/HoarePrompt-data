According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `z` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `z` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `z` will be incremented by 1, so `z` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

The values of `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, and `maxy` are determined by the inputs `a` and `b`, but they do not affect the loop condition directly. They remain the same unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
