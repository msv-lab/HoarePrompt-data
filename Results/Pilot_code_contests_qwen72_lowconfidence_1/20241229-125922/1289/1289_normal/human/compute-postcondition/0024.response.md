The function `func` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a mine. The list has a length n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. All coordinates are distinct. The function returns a value based on the processing of these coordinates, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Since the output details are not specified, I cannot provide a complete description of the return value. However, based on the typical use cases for such functions, it might involve some form of analysis or computation related to the mine coordinates, such as finding the closest pair of mines, calculating the area covered by the mines, or determining some other property of the set of points.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples representing (x, y) coordinates of mines, where the list length is 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. All coordinates are distinct. The function processes these coordinates and returns a value, but the specific output is not provided.**
