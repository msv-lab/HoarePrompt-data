Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum x-coordinate from all inputs, `minx` is the minimum x-coordinate from all inputs, `maxy` is the maximum y-coordinate from all inputs, `miny` is the minimum y-coordinate from all inputs, `t` is the number of inputs provided, `z` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`, otherwise `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last input integers if `t > 0`, otherwise `a` and `b` are undefined, `maxx` is at least `-10`, `minx` is at most `10`, `miny` is at most \(10^{18}\).**
