The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value (`-10`) and the input integer `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

If `a` is greater than `-10`, `maxx` will be set to `a`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains `-10`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is `max(-10, a)`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is \(10^{18}\), `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`maxx` is `max(-10, a)`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is \(10^{18}\), `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers**
