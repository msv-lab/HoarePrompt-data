The code initializes the variable `miny` to a very large value, specifically \(10^{18}\). This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents the (x, y) coordinates of a mine. The list has a length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and each coordinate xi, yi satisfies -10^9 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10^9. All coordinates are distinct. `t` is an input integer. `maxx` is `-10`, `minx` is `10`, `miny` is \(10^{18}\)**.
