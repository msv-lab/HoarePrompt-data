To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `maxx` is `max(-10, a)`
- `minx` is `min(10, a)`
- `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`
- `t` is greater than 0
- `z` is 0
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for z in xrange(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `z` is less than `t`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `z` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `z`**: Since `z` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the next value of `z` will be 1.
- **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `z` must still be less than `t`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `z` will be 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`maxx` is `max(-10, a)`, `minx` is `min(10, a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
