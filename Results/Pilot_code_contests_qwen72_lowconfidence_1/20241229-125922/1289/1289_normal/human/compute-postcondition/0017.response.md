The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This will change the values of `a` and `b` from their initial state (which were described as new input integers) to the actual integers provided by the user.

The initial state of the variables `maxx`, `minx`, `miny`, `t`, `z`, and `maxy` remains unchanged, except for the fact that `a` and `b` are now specific integers rather than just being described as new input integers.

Output State: **`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers from input, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
