The value of `maxx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a`. Since `maxx` is initially defined as `max(max(-10, a), a)`, which simplifies to `max(-10, a)`, the new value of `maxx` will be the maximum of `max(-10, a)` and `a`. Given that `max(-10, a)` is already the maximum between `-10` and `a`, this operation does not change the value of `maxx`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers from input, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`.
Output State: **`maxx` is `max(max(-10, a), a)`, `minx` is `min(min(10, a), a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 2, `z` is 2, `a` and `b` are the integers from input, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
