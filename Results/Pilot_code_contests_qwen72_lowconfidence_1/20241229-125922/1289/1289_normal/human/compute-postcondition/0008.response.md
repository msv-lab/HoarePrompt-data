The value of `maxy` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `b`. The current value of `maxy` is \(10^{18}\). The value of `b` is an input integer. Therefore, `maxy` will be the larger of \(10^{18}\) and `b`.

Output State: **`maxx` is `max(-10, a)`, `minx` is `min(10, a)`, `miny` is \(10^{18}\), `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**
