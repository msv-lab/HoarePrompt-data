The code calculates the maximum difference between the x-coordinates (`maxx - minx`) and the y-coordinates (`maxy - miny`), then prints the square of this maximum difference. The variables `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` are used in this calculation, but their values remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Let's break down the calculation:
- The maximum difference between x-coordinates is `maxx - minx`.
- The maximum difference between y-coordinates is `maxy - miny`.
- The maximum of these two differences is `max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)`.
- The square of this maximum difference is printed: `(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2`.

Since the code only performs a calculation and prints the result, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`maxx` is the maximum x-coordinate from all inputs, `minx` is the minimum x-coordinate from all inputs, `maxy` is the maximum y-coordinate from all inputs, `miny` is the minimum y-coordinate from all inputs, `t` is the number of inputs provided, `z` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`, otherwise `z` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last input integers if `t > 0`, otherwise `a` and `b` are undefined, `maxx` is at least `-10`, `minx` is at most `10`, `miny` is at most \(10^{18}\).**
