The code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This updates the values of `a` and `b` to new input integers, replacing their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`maxx` is `max(-10, a)`, `minx` is `min(10, a)`, `miny` is `min(10^18, b)`, `t` is greater than 1, `z` is 1, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `maxy` is the maximum of \(10^{18}\) and `b`**.
