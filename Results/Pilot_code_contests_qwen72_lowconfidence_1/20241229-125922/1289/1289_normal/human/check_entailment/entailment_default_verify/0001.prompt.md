You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Many computer strategy games require building cities, recruiting army, conquering tribes, collecting resources. Sometimes it leads to interesting problems. 

Let's suppose that your task is to build a square city. The world map uses the Cartesian coordinates. The sides of the city should be parallel to coordinate axes. The map contains mines with valuable resources, located at some points with integer coordinates. The sizes of mines are relatively small, i.e. they can be treated as points. The city should be built in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. 

Building a city takes large amount of money depending on the size of the city, so you have to build the city with the minimum area. Given the positions of the mines find the minimum possible area of the city.

Input

The first line of the input contains number n — the number of mines on the map (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers xi and yi — the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 109 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 109). All points are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources.

    (maxx, maxy) = (-10 ** 18, -10 ** 18)
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in xrange(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        minx = min(minx, a)
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        miny = min(miny, b)
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly computes the minimum area of a square city that can cover all the mines. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` to extreme values to ensure they get updated with the actual coordinates of the mines.
2. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of mines `t` and then iterates over each mine to read its coordinates `(a, b)`.
3. **Updating Extremes**: For each mine, it updates `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` to keep track of the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of the mines.
4. **Calculating Side Length**: After processing all the mines, it calculates the side length of the smallest square that can cover all the mines. This is done by taking the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates (`max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)`).
5. **Computing Area**: Finally, it prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:
- If all mines lie on a straight line, the program will still compute the correct minimum area.
- If the mines are spread out, the program will find the correct bounding square.
- The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem description, including the range of coordinates and the number of mines.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads a series of (x, y) coordinate pairs from the standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input integer `t`. It calculates the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates from these pairs. After processing all the coordinates, it computes the square of the larger of the two differences: (maximum x - minimum x) and (maximum y - minimum y). This squared value is then printed to the standard output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If no coordinates are provided (`t == 0`), the function will still execute without error, but the values of `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` will remain at their initial extreme values, leading to a printed result of \( (10^{18} + 10^{18})^2 \).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
