Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly computes the minimum area of a square city that can cover all the mines. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` to extreme values to ensure they get updated with the actual coordinates of the mines.
2. **Reading Input**: It reads the number of mines `t` and then iterates over each mine to read its coordinates `(a, b)`.
3. **Updating Extremes**: For each mine, it updates `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` to keep track of the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates of the mines.
4. **Calculating Side Length**: After processing all the mines, it calculates the side length of the smallest square that can cover all the mines. This is done by taking the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates (`max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)`).
5. **Computing Area**: Finally, it prints the area of the square by squaring the side length.

The program handles all edge cases correctly:
- If all mines lie on a straight line, the program will still compute the correct minimum area.
- If the mines are spread out, the program will find the correct bounding square.
- The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem description, including the range of coordinates and the number of mines.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
