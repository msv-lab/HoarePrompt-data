Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `t == 0`. According to the problem description, the number of mines `n` should be between 2 and 1000. However, the program does not check this condition and will still run if `t == 0`, leading to incorrect results. Specifically, if `t == 0`, the values of `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` will remain at their initial extreme values, and the program will print a very large number, which is not the expected behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this edge case.
