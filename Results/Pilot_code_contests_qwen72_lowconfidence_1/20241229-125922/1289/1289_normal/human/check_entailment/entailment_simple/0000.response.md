Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly compute the minimum area of the square city that can cover all the mines. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the side length of the square as `max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)`, which is correct. However, it then prints the result of `print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2`.
   - The issue is that the expression `print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2` is evaluated as `print((max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2)`, which is correct. However, the parentheses around `max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)` are necessary to ensure that the entire result is squared, and the program already includes these parentheses, so this part is actually correct.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()` instead. This is a minor issue, but it could cause the program to fail if run in Python 3.
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes it to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, which is correct.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly computes the minimum area of the square city and prints it, which matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the use of `raw_input()` instead of `input()` is a significant issue if the program is intended to be run in Python 3. However, assuming the program is run in Python 2, it would produce the correct output for the given problem description. Therefore, the primary reason for marking the program as incorrect is the use of `raw_input()`.

To make the program fully correct, you should replace `raw_input()` with `input()` if you intend to run it in Python 3. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    maxx, maxy = -10 ** 18, -10 ** 18
    minx = 10 ** 18
    miny = 10 ** 18
    for z in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        maxx = max(maxx, a)
        
        minx = min(minx, a)
        
        maxy = max(maxy, b)
        
        miny = min(miny, b)
        
    print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny) ** 2)
```

With this correction, the program will meet the requirements of the problem description and be considered correct.
