Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Output Calculation**: The program calculates the side length of the smallest square that can contain all the mines using `max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)`. However, it then prints the square of this value using `print(max(maxx - minx, maxy - miny)) ** 2`. This part is correct.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of mines `t` and then reads `t` pairs of coordinates. This part is also correct.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The problem description specifies that the number of mines `n` is between 2 and 1000. The program does not handle the case where `t` (which corresponds to `n` in the problem description) is less than 2. While the problem guarantees that `2 ≤ n ≤ 1000`, the program should still handle the edge case where `t` is 0 or 1 to ensure robustness.

4. **Initial Values**: The initial values for `maxx`, `maxy`, `minx`, and `miny` are set to extreme values (`-10 ** 18` and `10 ** 18`). This ensures that the first input will update these values correctly. However, if `t` were 0 or 1, these extreme values would lead to incorrect results. For example, if `t` is 0, the program will print \((10^{18} + 10^{18})^2\), which is clearly incorrect.

5. **Function Signature**: The function signature `def func():` does not match the problem description, which implies that the function should take a list of tuples as input. Instead, the function reads input directly from `raw_input()`. This discrepancy means the function does not conform to the expected input format.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle edge cases where `t` is 0 or 1, and it does not match the expected function signature. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
