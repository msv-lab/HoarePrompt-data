Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input is empty or when the number of mines is less than 2, which is against the problem constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Additionally, the program does not correctly compute the side length of the square city. It should compute the maximum of the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates, but it incorrectly computes this value directly without ensuring that the side length is at least the maximum of these two differences. This can lead to incorrect results in certain cases, such as when the x and y ranges are not equal. For example, consider the input:

```
3
0 0
0 3
3 0
```

The correct output should be 9 (a 3x3 square), but the program outputs 4, which is incorrect.
