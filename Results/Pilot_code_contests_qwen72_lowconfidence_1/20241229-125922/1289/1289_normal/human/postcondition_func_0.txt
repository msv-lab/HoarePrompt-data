The function reads a series of (x, y) coordinate pairs from the standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input integer `t`. It calculates the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates from these pairs. After processing all the coordinates, it computes the square of the larger of the two differences: (maximum x - minimum x) and (maximum y - minimum y). This squared value is then printed to the standard output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. If no coordinates are provided (`t == 0`), the function will still execute without error, but the values of `maxx`, `minx`, `maxy`, and `miny` will remain at their initial extreme values, leading to a printed result of \( (10^{18} + 10^{18})^2 \).
