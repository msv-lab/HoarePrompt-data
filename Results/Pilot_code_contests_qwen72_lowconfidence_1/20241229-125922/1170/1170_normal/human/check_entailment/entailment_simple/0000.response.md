Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Sorting and Reversing the Books**: 
   - The program sorts the books by their width in descending order (`myBooks.sort(); myBooks.reverse()`). However, this approach is not optimal. The goal is to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books while ensuring that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books. Sorting by width alone does not guarantee the minimum total thickness of the vertical books.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the books and adds their thickness to `T` and subtracts their width from `W`. The loop breaks when `W <= T`. While this condition is necessary, the way the books are selected (based on width) does not ensure that the minimum total thickness is achieved.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The optimal solution involves a different approach. One effective method is to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to select the books with the smallest thickness first, ensuring that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books does not exceed the total thickness of the vertical books.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
5
1 12
1 3
2 15
2 5
2 1
```

The correct output should be `5` (as shown in the example output). However, the program might produce a different result because it sorts the books by width and then processes them, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum total thickness of the vertical books.

### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve:
1. **Sorting the books by thickness** (to prioritize thinner books).
2. **Using a greedy algorithm** to add books to the vertical stack until the sum of the widths of the remaining books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    books = []
    for _ in range(n):
        t, w = map(int, input().split())
        books.append((t, w))
    
    # Sort books by thickness, then by width (in descending order)
    books.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    total_thickness = 0
    total_width = sum(w for _, w in books)
    
    for t, w in books:
        total_thickness += t
        total_width -= w
        if total_width <= total_thickness:
            break
    
    print(total_thickness)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the books are selected in a way that minimizes the total thickness of the vertical books while satisfying the constraint that the sum of the widths of the horizontal books is no more than the total thickness of the vertical books.
