Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the books with the smallest widths should be placed horizontally to minimize the total thickness of the vertical books. The current implementation sorts the books in descending order of their widths and tries to place the books with the largest widths horizontally, which can lead to a suboptimal solution.

Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
3
2 1
2 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
4
```

In this case, the optimal solution would be to place the book with width 3 vertically and the other two books horizontally, resulting in a total thickness of 3. However, the program places the books with widths 2 and 1 horizontally, leading to a total thickness of 4, which is not the minimum possible.
