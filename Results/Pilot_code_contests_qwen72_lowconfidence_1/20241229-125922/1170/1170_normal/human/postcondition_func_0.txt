The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of books, followed by `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` representing the thickness and width of each book. It calculates the total width `W` of all books and stores the books in a list `myBooks` as `[w, t]` pairs. The function then sorts the books in descending order by width and iterates through them, adding their thickness to a cumulative reading time `T` and subtracting their width from `W`. The iteration stops when the remaining width `W` is less than or equal to the cumulative reading time `T`. Finally, the function prints the cumulative reading time `T`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 0. The function handles the case where no books are provided (i.e., `n = 0`) by printing 0 without performing any other operations.
