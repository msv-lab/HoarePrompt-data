The code snippet updates the value of `T` by adding the second element of the current `book` (which is the first element of the `myBooks` list in this context). Given the initial state, let's determine the new state:

- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100).
- `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration.
- `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration.
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.
- If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

The code snippet `T += book[1]` adds the second element of the current `book` to `T`. Since `book` is the first element of `myBooks`, which is a list `[w, t]`, `book[1]` is the `t` value of the current book.

Therefore, the updated value of `T` is `T + t`, where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration, `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
