The code snippet `myBooks.append([w, t])` appends a new element `[w, t]` to the list `myBooks`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `myBooks` is a list containing one element `[w, t]`, `W` is `w`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `w` is the second integer from the input, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
