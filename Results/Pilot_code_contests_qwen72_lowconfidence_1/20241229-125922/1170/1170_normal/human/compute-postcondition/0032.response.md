The value of `W` is updated by subtracting the first element of the current `book` from its previous value. The initial state indicates that `book` refers to the next sublist in `myBooks`, and `W` is initially defined as `W - book[0]`.

Given the initial state, let's assume `book` is the next sublist in `myBooks`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains two elements: `w` and `t`. Let's denote the current `book` as `[w_current, t_current]`.

The code snippet `W -= book[0]` updates `W` to `W - w_current`.

Since `i` is `n-1` and `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - w_current` where `w_current` is the first element of the next sublist in `myBooks`, `T` is `T + t_current` where `t_current` is the second element of the next sublist in `myBooks`. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
