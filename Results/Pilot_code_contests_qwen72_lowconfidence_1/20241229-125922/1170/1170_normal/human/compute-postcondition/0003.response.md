To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given as an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `n` is always greater than 0, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.
   - `myBooks` is an empty list.
   - `W` is 0.

3. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the first iteration.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - The loop variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range(0, n)` function.
   - `myBooks` being an empty list and `W` being 0 are initial conditions that do not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect the initial conditions and the fact that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `myBooks` is an empty list, `W` is 0, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
