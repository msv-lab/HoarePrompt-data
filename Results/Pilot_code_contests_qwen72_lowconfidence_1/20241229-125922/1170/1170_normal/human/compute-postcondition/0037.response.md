The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters from the given signature, but based on the context, it seems to work with a predefined set of inputs related to books, where `n` is an integer representing the number of books, and each book is described by a pair of integers `(ti, wi)` indicating the thickness and width of the book, respectively. The constraints are that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ ti ≤ 2`, and `1 ≤ wi ≤ 100`.

However, since the function signature does not include parameters and the problem statement does not specify what the function returns, I will assume the function processes these inputs internally and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Given the lack of specific return details in the problem statement, I'll infer a plausible functionality:

The function `func` processes a list of `n` books, each defined by its thickness `ti` and width `wi`. The function returns a value or structure that represents some computed property or decision based on the books' dimensions, adhering to the constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ ti ≤ 2`, and `1 ≤ wi ≤ 100`.

Functionality: **The function processes a list of `n` books, each defined by its thickness `ti` and width `wi`, and returns a value or structure based on the books' dimensions, adhering to the constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ ti ≤ 2`, and `1 ≤ wi ≤ 100`.**
