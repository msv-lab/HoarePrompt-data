To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing `n` elements, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100).
- `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the input pairs.
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.
- If `n` is 0, `myBooks` remains an empty list and `W` is 0.
- `T` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```
for book in myBooks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `myBooks` list.
- For the loop to execute, `myBooks` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `myBooks` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- Given that `n` is the number of elements in `myBooks`, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `myBooks` must be a non-empty list with at least one element.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the input pairs.
- `T` is 0.

### Formatted State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the input pairs, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100, `T` is 0.**
