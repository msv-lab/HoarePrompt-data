The code initializes a new variable `T` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `myBooks`, or `W`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing `n` elements, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the input pairs, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `n` is 0, `myBooks` remains an empty list and `W` is 0. `T` is 0.**
