To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop iterates based on the value of `i` and the upper limit `n`.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `i` is 1
- `myBooks` is a list containing two elements `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`
- `W` is `2 * w`
- `t` is the first integer from the next input pair
- `w` is the second integer from the next input pair
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `myBooks`, `W`, `t`, `w`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain the same.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `myBooks` is a list containing two elements `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`, `W` is `2 * w`, `t` is the first integer from the next input pair, `w` is the second integer from the next input pair, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**
