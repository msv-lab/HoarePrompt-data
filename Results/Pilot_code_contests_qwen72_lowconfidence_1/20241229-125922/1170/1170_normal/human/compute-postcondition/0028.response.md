The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement immediately. No changes occur to the variables mentioned in the initial state except for the control flow.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - book[0]`, `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
