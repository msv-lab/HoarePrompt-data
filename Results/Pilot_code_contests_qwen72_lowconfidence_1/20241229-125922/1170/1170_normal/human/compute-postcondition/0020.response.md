The code snippet updates the value of `T` by adding the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks` to it. Since `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list and contains at least one element, `book[1]` refers to the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`.

Let's denote the first sublist in `myBooks` as `[w1, t1]`. The value of `T` is updated by adding `t1` to its current value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is the sum of all `w` values from the input pairs, `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.**
