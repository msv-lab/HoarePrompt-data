To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `myBooks` is a list containing one element `[w, t]`.
- `W` is `w`.
- `t` is the first integer from the input.
- `w` is the second integer from the input.
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- The list `myBooks` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and no additional elements are appended in this step.
- All other variables (`n`, `W`, `t`, `w`) remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `myBooks` is a list containing one element `[w, t]`, `W` is `w`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `w` is the second integer from the input, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
