The value of `n` is assigned the result of converting the user's input into an integer using `int(raw_input())`. The previous state specified that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, which remains true after the assignment since the new value of `n` comes from the user input and is constrained by the same condition. The pairs of integers (ti, wi) remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and there are n pairs of integers (ti, wi) where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100, representing the thickness and width of each book respectively.**
