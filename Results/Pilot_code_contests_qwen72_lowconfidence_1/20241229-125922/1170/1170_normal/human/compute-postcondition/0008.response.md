The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `t` and `w`. This affects the values of `t` and `w` in the initial state. Since the initial state specifies that `t` and `w` are derived from the first and second integers of the input, respectively, this operation essentially updates `t` and `w` with new values from the next pair of integers in the input sequence.

The updated state will reflect these changes, while the other variables (`n`, `i`, `myBooks`, `W`) remain unchanged. The new values of `t` and `w` are specific to the next pair of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `myBooks` is a list containing one element `[w, t]`, `W` is `w`, `t` is the first integer from the next input pair, `w` is the second integer from the next input pair, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**
