The code appends a new element `[w, t]` to the list `myBooks`. Initially, `myBooks` contains two elements `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`. After appending, `myBooks` will contain three elements. The values of `n`, `i`, `W`, `t`, and `w` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `myBooks` is a list containing three elements `[w, t]`, `[w, t]`, and `[w, t]`, `W` is `3 * w`, `t` is the first integer from the next input pair, `w` is the second integer from the next input pair, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**
