The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `t` and the second part to `w` after converting both to integers.

- `t` and `w` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `myBooks`, and `W` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `myBooks` is an empty list, `W` is 0, `t` is the first integer from the input, `w` is the second integer from the input, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
