The code snippet `myBooks.append([w, t])` adds a new element `[w, t]` to the list `myBooks`. Given the initial state, `myBooks` initially contains one element `[w, t]`, and after executing the code, it will contain two elements: the original `[w, t]` and the newly added `[w, t]`.

Here is the updated state:

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `i` is 1
- `myBooks` is a list containing two elements: `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`
- `W` is `2 * w`
- `t` is the first integer from the next input pair
- `w` is the second integer from the next input pair
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `myBooks` is a list containing two elements `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`, `W` is `2 * w`, `t` is the first integer from the next input pair, `w` is the second integer from the next input pair, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**
