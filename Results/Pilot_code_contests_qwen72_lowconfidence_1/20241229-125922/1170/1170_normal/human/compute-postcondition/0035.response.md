Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing `n` elements, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100). `W` is the remaining weight after subtracting the weights of the books processed until the condition `W <= T` is met or all books are processed. `T` is the cumulative time spent reading the books processed until the condition `W <= T` is met or all books are processed. If `W` is less than or equal to `T` at any point, the loop breaks early. If the loop completes without breaking, `W` will be the initial `W` minus the sum of weights of all books, and `T` will be the sum of the reading times of all books. If `n` is 0, `myBooks` remains an empty list and `W` is 0, and `T` remains 0.**
