Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100). If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `W` is `W - w_current` where `w_current` is the first element of the next sublist in `myBooks`, `T` is `T + t_current` where `t_current` is the second element of the next sublist in `myBooks`. If `W` is greater than `T`, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.***
