The code snippet `W += w` adds the value of `w` (the second integer from the input) to the current value of `W`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `i` is 0
- `myBooks` is an empty list
- `W` is 0
- `t` is the first integer from the input
- `w` is the second integer from the input
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100

After executing `W += w`, the value of `W` is updated to `w`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `myBooks` is an empty list, `W` is `w`, `t` is the first integer from the input, `w` is the second integer from the input, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
