The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `t` and the second part to `w`. Both `t` and `w` are converted to integers.

- `t` is now the first integer from the next input pair.
- `w` is now the second integer from the next input pair.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `myBooks`, `W`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `myBooks` is a list containing two elements `[w, t]` and `[w, t]`, `W` is `2 * w`, `t` is the first integer from the next input pair, `w` is the second integer from the next input pair, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100**.
