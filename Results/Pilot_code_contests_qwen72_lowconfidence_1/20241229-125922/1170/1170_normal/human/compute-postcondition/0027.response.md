The code `W -= book[0]` subtracts the first element of the current `book` (which is the first sublist in `myBooks`) from `W`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100)
- `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration
- `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100
- If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

After executing the code `W -= book[0]`:
- `W` is updated to `W - book[0]`, where `book[0]` is the first element of the current `book` (the first sublist in `myBooks`).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \)
- `i` is `n-1`
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100)
- `W` is `W - book[0]` (updated value)
- `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100
- If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - book[0]`, `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100, if `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
