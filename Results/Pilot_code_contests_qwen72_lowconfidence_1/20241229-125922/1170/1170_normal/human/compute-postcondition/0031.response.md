The value of `T` is updated by adding the second element (`book[1]`) of the current sublist in `myBooks` to its existing value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged unless they depend on the new value of `T`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100). `W` is `W - book[0]` and `T` is `T + book[1]` where `book[1]` is the second element of the next sublist in `myBooks`. There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
