To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100).
- `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks`.
- `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`.
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.
- If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for book in myBooks:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `myBooks`**: Since `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list, the first element of `myBooks` is the largest element based on some sorting criteria (not specified, but it doesn't affect the iteration logic). After the first iteration, the first element is processed, and the loop moves to the next element in the list.

2. **Variables `W` and `T`**: These variables are updated based on the first element of `myBooks` in the previous iteration. Specifically:
   - `W` is decreased by the weight `w1` of the first element.
   - `T` is increased by the type `t1` of the first element.

3. **Condition Check**: The loop continues as long as `W` is greater than `T`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is not directly used in the loop iteration, so it remains `n-1`.
- **`myBooks`**: The list `myBooks` is processed one element at a time. After the first iteration, the first element is no longer considered, so the next element in the list becomes the "first" element for the next iteration.
- **`W`**: `W` is updated to `W - w1` where `w1` is the weight of the first element of `myBooks` from the previous iteration.
- **`T`**: `T` is updated to `T + t1` where `t1` is the type of the first element of `myBooks` from the previous iteration.

### New State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `myBooks` now refers to the remaining elements of the list, excluding the first element processed in the previous iteration.
- `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the weight of the first element of `myBooks` from the previous iteration.
- `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the type of the first element of `myBooks` from the previous iteration.
- The condition `W > T` must still hold for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration, `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks` from the previous iteration, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
