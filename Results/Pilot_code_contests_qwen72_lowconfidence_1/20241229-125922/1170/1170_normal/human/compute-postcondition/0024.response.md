Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - w1` where `w1` is the first element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, `T` is `T + t1` where `t1` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`, and there are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.***
