To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100).
- `W` is `W - book[0]` and `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the first sublist in `myBooks`.
- There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100.
- If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for book in myBooks:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element.
   - `W` and `T` have been updated based on the previous iteration.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `myBooks`, so the next iteration will use the next element in `myBooks`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `book` will now refer to the next element in `myBooks`.
   - `W` and `T` will be updated based on the new `book` values.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `myBooks`.
   - The condition `W > T` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains `n-1` because the loop variable `i` is not directly modified by the loop.
- `myBooks` will have the same structure but the next element will be used.
- `W` and `T` will be updated based on the new `book` values.

Given the above analysis, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100). `W` is `W - book[0]` and `T` is `T + t` where `t` is the second element of the next sublist in `myBooks`. There are `n` pairs of integers `(ti, wi)` where 1 ≤ ti ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100. If `W` is less than or equal to `T`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.**
