The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently executing. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but the control flow of the program is affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), `i` is `n-1`, `myBooks` is a reversed sorted list containing at least 1 element, each element is a list `[w, t]` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2) and `w` is an integer (1 ≤ w ≤ 100), `W` is `W - w_current` where `w_current` is the first element of the next sublist in `myBooks`, `T` is `T + t_current` where `t_current` is the second element of the next sublist in `myBooks`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
