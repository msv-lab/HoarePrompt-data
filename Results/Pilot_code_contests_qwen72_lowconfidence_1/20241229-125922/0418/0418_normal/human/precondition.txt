n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000. The list of souvenirs is represented by two lists or tuples, weights and costs, where each element in weights corresponds to the weight of a souvenir (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3) and each element in costs corresponds to the cost of a souvenir (1 ≤ ci ≤ 109), and both lists have length n.
