The code snippet `data[i].reverse()` reverses the list located at index `i` in the `data` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed, the list at index `n + 1` is reversed, and the list at index `n + 2` is sorted.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `n + 2` must be less than or equal to 3.

Since `i` is `n + 2`, the list at index `i` in `data` is reversed. This means the list that was previously sorted at index `i` is now reversed again.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 2`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed, the list at index `n + 1` is reversed, and the list at index `n + 2` is reversed, `w` and `c` are input integers, `n + 2` must be less than or equal to 3.**
