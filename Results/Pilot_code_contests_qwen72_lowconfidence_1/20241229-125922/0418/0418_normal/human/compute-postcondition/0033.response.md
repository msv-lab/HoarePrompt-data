The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and moves the control back to the beginning of the loop, skipping any code that follows in the current iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not alter any variable values, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0), j is 1`. Additionally, either `i - j < 0` or `dp[i - j][j] >= len(data[j])` is true.**
