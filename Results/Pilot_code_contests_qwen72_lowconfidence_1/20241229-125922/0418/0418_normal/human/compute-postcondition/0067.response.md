To solve this, let's break down the code and its impact on the program:

- `i` is 300010.
- `j` is 3.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples.
- `val` is initially defined as `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`.

The new assignment for `val` is:
```python
val = dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]
```

Breaking this down:
- `i - j` evaluates to `300010 - 3`, which is `300007`.
- `dp[i - j][0]` accesses the first element of the tuple at index `300007` in the `dp` list.
- `dp[i - j][j]` accesses the third element (since `j` is 3) of the tuple at index `300007` in the `dp` list.
- `data[j][dp[i - j][j]]` accesses the element in the `data` list at index `j` (which is 3), using the value from `dp[300007][3]` as the index.

Thus, the new value of `val` is calculated as:
```python
val = dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]
```

The state of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `dp`, `j`) remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`.**
