Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0), j is 1`. Additionally, if `i - j < 0` or `dp[i - j][j] >= len(data[j])`, the condition is met and no further changes are made to the variables.***
