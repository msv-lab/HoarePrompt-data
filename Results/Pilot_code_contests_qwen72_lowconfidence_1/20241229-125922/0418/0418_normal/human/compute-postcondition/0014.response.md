The code `data[i].reverse()` reverses the list located at index `i` in the `data` list. Given that `i` is `n`, the list at index `n` in `data` is reversed.

- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` remains equal to `n`.
- `m` is an integer read from input and is not affected.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists, and the list at index `n` is now reversed.
- `w` and `c` are input integers and are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is now reversed, `w` and `c` are input integers.**
