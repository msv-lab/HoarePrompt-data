Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples. If `data[1][0]` (which is `val`) is greater than `dp[i][0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `(data[1][0], 1 if j is 1 else 0, 0 if j is 1 else 1)`, `j` remains 1 or changes to not 1, and `a0` is set to `data[1][0]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `dp[i][0]` is less than the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`.***
