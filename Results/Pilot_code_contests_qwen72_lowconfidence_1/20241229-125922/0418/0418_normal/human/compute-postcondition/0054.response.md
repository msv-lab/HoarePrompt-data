The code snippet assigns the value of `val` to the variable `a0`. Based on the initial state, `val` is defined as `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`.

Therefore, the new state of the program is:
- `a0` is now equal to `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a0` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`**.
