To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed and the list at index `i` is reversed.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to 3 (inclusive). This means `i` will take values 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3, so `n` must be less than or equal to 2.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `(n + 1) + 1 = n + 2`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - `n + 2` must be less than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

5. **Data List**:
   - The list at index `n` is already reversed.
   - The list at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) is already reversed.
   - For the next iteration, the list at index `i` (which will be `n + 2`) will be reversed.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is now `n + 2`.
- `m` remains the same.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed, the list at index `n + 1` is reversed, and the list at index `n + 2` will be reversed.
- `w` and `c` remain the same.
- `n + 2` must be less than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 2`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed, the list at index `n + 1` is reversed, and the list at index `n + 2` is reversed, `w` and `c` are input integers, `n + 2` must be less than or equal to 3**
