The code `data[w].append(c)` appends the integer `c` to the list located at index `w` in the `data` list. 

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `m` remains an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists, but now the list at index `w` contains the integer `c`.
- `w` and `c` remain the integers read from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
