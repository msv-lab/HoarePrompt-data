The code `data[w].append(c)` modifies the list located at index `w` in the `data` list by appending the value of `c` to it.

- Initially, `data` is a list containing 4 lists, and the list at index `w` is `[c, c]`.
- After executing the code, the list at index `w` in `data` will be `[c, c, c]`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `w`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c, c, c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
