The value of `a2` is set to `dp[i - j][2]`. Given that `i` is 300010 and `j` is 2, `i - j` evaluates to 300008. Therefore, `a2` is assigned the value of `dp[300008][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a0` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300008][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300008][2]`**
