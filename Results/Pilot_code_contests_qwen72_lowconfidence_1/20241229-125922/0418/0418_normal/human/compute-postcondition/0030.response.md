To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300010.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, m + 1)` will execute if `m` is at least 1. This is because the range function `range(1, m + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `m` inclusive. If `m` is less than 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initially set to 300010. However, this initial value of `i` is irrelevant to the loop because the loop reassigns `i` to values generated by `range(1, m + 1)`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `data`, `w`, `c`, and `dp`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. They are used within the loop body but do not influence whether the loop starts or not.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `m` is at least 1. The initial value of `i` is irrelevant to the loop's execution, and the other variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`**
