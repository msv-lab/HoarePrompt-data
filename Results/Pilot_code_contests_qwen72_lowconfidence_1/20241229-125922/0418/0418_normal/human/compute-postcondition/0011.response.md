To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Conditions**: `n` and `m` are integers read from input, and `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `n` times, and during each iteration, it reads two integers `w` and `c` from the input and appends `c` to the list at index `w` in `data`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Before Loop**: 
  - `n` is an integer (could be 0 or positive).
  - `m` is an integer (its value is not used in the loop).
  - `data` is a list of 4 empty lists: `[[], [], [], []]`.

- **During Loop**:
  - For each iteration `i` (from 0 to `n-1`):
    - `w` and `c` are read from input.
    - `data[w].append(c)` adds `c` to the list at index `w` in `data`.

- **After Loop**:
  - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `data` remains `[[], [], [], []]`.
  - If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration:
    - `w` and `c` will be appended to `data[w]`.

### Final Output State:

- **`n`**: The number of iterations the loop executed.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` will be `n` (since the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`).
- **`m`**: Remains an integer read from input.
- **`data`**: A list of 4 lists, where each list at index `w` contains the integers `c` that were read and appended during the loop. The length of each list at index `w` will be the number of times `w` was input during the loop.
- **`w` and `c`**: These are input values and are not stored in the final state after the loop.

### Conclusion:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains the integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers.**
