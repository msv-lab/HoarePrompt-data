The given code snippet is:

```python
val = dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]
```

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 300011.
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 300011.
   - `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty.
   - `w` and `c` are input integers.
   - `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
   - `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop.
   - `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
   - `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `i - j` is `300011 - 3 = 300008`.
   - `dp[i - j][0]` is `dp[300008][0]`, which is initially `0`.
   - `dp[i - j][j]` is `dp[300008][3]`, which is initially `0` (since `dp` is initialized to `(0, 0, 0)`).
   - `data[j][dp[i - j][j]]` is `data[3][0]`. Since `data[3]` is initially an empty list, accessing `data[3][0]` will raise an `IndexError`.

Given that `data[3]` is initially empty, attempting to access `data[3][0]` will result in an `IndexError`. Therefore, the code will not execute successfully, and no changes will be made to the variables.

**Output State**:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300011.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300011.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
- `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop.
- `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
- `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.
- `j` is 3.
- An `IndexError` is raised due to accessing an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 3, and an `IndexError` is raised due to accessing an empty list.**
