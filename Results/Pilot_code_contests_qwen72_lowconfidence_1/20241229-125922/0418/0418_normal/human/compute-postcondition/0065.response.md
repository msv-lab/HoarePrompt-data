The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and moves immediately to the next iteration of the loop. It does not alter the values of any variables directly.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300010
- `m` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples
- `j` is 3
- `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`
- If `dp[300010][0] < dp[300009][0]`, then `dp[300010]` is updated to the same value as `dp[300009]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Since the `continue` statement does not change any of these values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`. If `dp[300010][0] < dp[300009][0]`, then `dp[300010]` is updated to the same value as `dp[300009]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
