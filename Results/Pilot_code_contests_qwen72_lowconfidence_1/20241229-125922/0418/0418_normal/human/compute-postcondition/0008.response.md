According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c, c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
