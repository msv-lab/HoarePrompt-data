`a1` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j][1]`. Given that `i` is 300012 and `j` is 2, `i - j` equals 300010. Therefore, `a1` is assigned the value of `dp[300010][1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` is 2, `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`**
