The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This does not alter the values of any variables directly, but it affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300012.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (each initially empty but potentially modified during the loop).
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, each containing the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index.
- Either `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`.

The `continue` statement does not change any of these conditions. The only effect is that the program will skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (each initially empty but potentially modified during the loop), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, each containing the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Additionally, either `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`. We skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
