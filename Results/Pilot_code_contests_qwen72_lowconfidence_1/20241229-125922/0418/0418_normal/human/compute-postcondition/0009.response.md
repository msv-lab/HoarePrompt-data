The code reads two integers from the input, assigning them to `w` and `c`. This means that `w` and `c` will now hold new values based on the input. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c, c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
