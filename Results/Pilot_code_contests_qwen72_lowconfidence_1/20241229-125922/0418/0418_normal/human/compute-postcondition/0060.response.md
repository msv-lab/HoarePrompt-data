The code assigns the tuple `(a0, a1, a2)` to the list `dp` at index `i`.

- `a0` is defined as `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`.
- Since `j` is 2, `a1` remains `dp[300008][1]`.
- Since `j` is 2, `a2` is `dp[300008][2] + 1`.

The value of `i` is 300010, so `dp[300010]` is updated to `(a0, a1, a2)`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a0` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300008][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300008][2] + 1`, `dp[300010]` is `(a0, a1, a2)`.**
