Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`. If `val` is greater than `dp[300010][0]`, then `dp[300010]` is updated to `(dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]], dp[300007][1], dp[300007][2] + 1)`. Otherwise, the state of `dp[300010]` remains unchanged.***
