The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or if statement it is within. No variables are directly modified by this statement. The conditions and values specified in the initial state remain unchanged, except for the program flow which now exits the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `sum` is `data[3][0]`, and `data[3]` must have at least one element. If `ans < sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`, then `ans` is updated to `data[3][0] + dp[w - 3][0]`. The current value of `ans` is no longer less than the sum of `data[3][0]` and `dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
