The value of `a2` is set to `dp[i - j][2]`. Given that `i` is 300010 and `j` is 3, the expression `i - j` evaluates to `300010 - 3`, which is `300007`. Therefore, `a2` is assigned the value of `dp[300007][2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `w`, `c`, `dp`, `j`, `val`, `a0`, and `a1` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a0` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a1` is `dp[300007][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300007][2]`**
