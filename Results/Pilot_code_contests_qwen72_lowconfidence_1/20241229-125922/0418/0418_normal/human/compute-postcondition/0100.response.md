The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and the control to pass to the next iteration of the loop. However, since there's no loop explicitly shown in the provided snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be determined within the context of the given code alone. Assuming this is part of a larger loop, the `continue` statement would cause the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 2**
