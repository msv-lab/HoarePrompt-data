The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `a1` was `dp[300010][1]`, so the new value of `a1` is `dp[300010][1] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` remains 2, `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300010][1] + 1`, `a2` is `dp[300010][2]`**
