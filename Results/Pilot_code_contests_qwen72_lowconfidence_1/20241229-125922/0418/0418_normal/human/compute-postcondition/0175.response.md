Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` is 2. If `dp[300012][0] < dp[300011][0]`, `dp[300012]` is updated to `dp[300011]`, and the values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged, and `dp[300012]` is not modified.***
