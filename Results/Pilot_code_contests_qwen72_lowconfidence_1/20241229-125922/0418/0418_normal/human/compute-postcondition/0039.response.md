The code snippet `a2 = dp[i - j][2]` retrieves the third element (index 2) from the tuple located at the index `i - j` in the `dp` list.

Given:
- `i` is 300010.
- `j` is 1.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`.

Calculating the index for `dp`:
- `i - j` = 300010 - 1 = 300009.

Accessing the tuple at index 300009 in `dp`:
- `dp[300009]` = `(0, 0, 0)`.

Retrieving the third element (index 2) from this tuple:
- `a2` = 0.

Therefore, the updated value of `a2` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`, `j` is 1, `val` is `data[1][0]`, the current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp`, `a0` is `data[1][0]`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0.**
