Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `ans` is equal to `dp[w][0]`, `sum` is 0, and `data[3]` must have at least one element. If `(i + 1) * 3 > w`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
