The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i - j][1]` to `a1`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300012.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified).
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples.
- `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`.
- `j` remains 2.
- `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`.

We calculate `i - j` which is `300012 - 2 = 300010`. Therefore, `a1` is assigned the value of `dp[300010][1]`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300012.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified).
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples.
- `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`.
- `j` remains 2.
- `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`.
- `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` remains 2, `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`**
