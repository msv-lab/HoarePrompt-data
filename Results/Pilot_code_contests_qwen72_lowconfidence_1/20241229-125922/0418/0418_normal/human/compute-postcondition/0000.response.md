The code initializes a list named `data` with 4 empty lists, which means `data` now contains 4 sublists. This does not affect the values of `n` or `m`, nor does it affect the subsequent lines of input data.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000. There are n lines following the first line, each containing two integers wi and ci, where 1 ≤ wi ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109, representing the weight and cost of the ith souvenir, respectively. `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.**
