According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to the upper limit of the range, which is 300010. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by 1, and it must still be less than 300010.

Given that `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be `n + 1`. Since `n` is less than 300010, `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 300010 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0, 0)`**
