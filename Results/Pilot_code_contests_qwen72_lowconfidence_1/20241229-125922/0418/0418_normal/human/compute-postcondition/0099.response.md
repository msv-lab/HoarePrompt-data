To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300011.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300011.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
- `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop.
- `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
- `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.
- If `dp[i][0] < dp[i - 1][0]`, then `dp[i][0]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][0]`, `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][1]`, and `dp[i][2]` is updated to `dp[i - 1][2]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, 3):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 to 2 (inclusive).
- The loop will execute if `j` is within the range 1 to 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

### Adjusting the State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2.
- All other states remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 2**.
