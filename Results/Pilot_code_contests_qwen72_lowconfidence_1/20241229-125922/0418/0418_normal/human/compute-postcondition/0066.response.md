Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`. If `i - j < 0` or `dp[i - j][j] >= len(data[j])`, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `dp[300010][0] < dp[300009][0]`, then `dp[300010]` is updated to the same value as `dp[300009]`.***
