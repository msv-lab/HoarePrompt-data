Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples. If `j` is 1, `a0` is `dp[i - 1][0] + data[1][dp[i - 1][1]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - 1][1] + 1`, and `a2` is `dp[i - 1][2]`. Otherwise, if `j` is not equal to 1, `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]`, and `a2` is `dp[i - j][2] + 1`.***
