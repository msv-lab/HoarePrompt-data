To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the changes it makes to the variables. Let's break down the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    data[i].sort()
    data[i].reverse()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 3` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, the list at index `i` in `data` is sorted and then reversed.

2. **Changes to Variables**:
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer and is not modified by the loop.
   - `i` is a loop variable that ranges from 1 to 3 and is not related to the initial `i` (which is `n`).
   - `m` remains an integer read from input and is not modified by the loop.
   - `data` is modified such that the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 are sorted and then reversed.
   - `w` and `c` remain input integers and are not modified by the loop.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 in `data` will be sorted and then reversed. This means they will be in descending order.
- The list at index 0 in `data` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies indices 1, 2, and 3.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 are in descending order, and the list at index 0 is unchanged, `w` and `c` are input integers.**
