The code snippet `n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m`, respectively.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within certain ranges, and `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.
- After executing the code, `n` and `m` will be assigned new values based on the input.
- The values of `n` and `m` in the initial state are overridden by the new values from the input.
- The state of `data` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.**
