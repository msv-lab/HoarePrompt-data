The line of code `a2 = dp[i - j][2]` accesses the third element of the tuple located at index `i - j` in the list `dp`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 300011
- `j` is 3

Therefore, `i - j` evaluates to `300011 - 3`, which is `300008`. This means `a2` will be assigned the value of `dp[300008][2]`.

Since `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, and each tuple is initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, the value of `dp[300008][2]` is `0`.

Thus, `a2` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 3, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, and an `IndexError` is raised due to accessing an empty list. A `NameError` is raised due to the undefined variable `val`.**
