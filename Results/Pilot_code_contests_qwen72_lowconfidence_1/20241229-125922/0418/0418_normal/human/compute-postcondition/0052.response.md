Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2. If `i - j < 0` or `dp[i - j][j] >= len(data[j])`, `a0` is set to `data[1][0]` if `data[1][0]` is greater than `dp[i][0]` after the update, otherwise `a0` remains unchanged.***
