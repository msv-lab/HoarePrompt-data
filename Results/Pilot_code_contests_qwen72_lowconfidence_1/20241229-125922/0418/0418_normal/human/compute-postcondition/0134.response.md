Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (each initially empty but potentially modified during the loop), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, each containing the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. If `i - j` is less than 0 or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`, the rest of the current iteration is skipped and the loop moves to the next iteration. The value of `val` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]` and `val` is greater than `dp[i][0]`.***
