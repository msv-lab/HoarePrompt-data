The code snippet assigns a tuple `(a0, a1, a2)` to the `dp` list at index `i`. The values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` are calculated based on the given expressions using the current values of `dp` and `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300010.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples.
- `j` is 3.
- `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`.
- `a0` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`.
- `a1` is `dp[300007][1] + (1 if j == 1 else 0)`.
- `a2` is `dp[300007][2] + (1 if j != 1 else 0)`.

The code:
```python
dp[i] = a0, a1, a2
```

Impact:
- The value of `dp[300010]` is updated to the tuple `(a0, a1, a2)`.

Calculations:
- `a0` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`.
- `a1` is `dp[300007][1] + (1 if j == 1 else 0)`, which simplifies to `dp[300007][1] + 0` since `j` is 3.
- `a2` is `dp[300007][2] + (1 if j != 1 else 0)`, which simplifies to `dp[300007][2] + 1` since `j` is 3.

Therefore, the updated value of `dp[300010]` is `(dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]], dp[300007][1], dp[300007][2] + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a0` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a1` is `dp[300007][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300007][2] + 1`, `dp[300010]` is `(dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]], dp[300007][1], dp[300007][2] + 1)`**
