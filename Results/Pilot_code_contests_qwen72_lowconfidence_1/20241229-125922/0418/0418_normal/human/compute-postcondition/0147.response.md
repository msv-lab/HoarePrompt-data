Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples. If `dp[i][0]` is less than `dp[i - 1][0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
