The given code snippet updates the `sum` variable by adding the value at index `i` of `data[3]`. Let's go through the changes step by step:

- `sum` is initially set to `data[3][0]`.
- The code `sum += data[3][i]` adds the value at index `i` of `data[3]` to the current value of `sum`.

Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `sum` will be `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `data`, `w`, `c`, `dp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`, and `data[3]` must have at least one element. If `(i + 1) * 3 > w`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `ans < sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`, then `ans` is updated to `data[3][0] + dp[w - 3][0]`, and the current value of `ans` is no longer less than the sum of `data[3][0]` and `dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`.**
