The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the snippet, this `continue` statement would typically cause an error if executed in isolation. Assuming this is part of a larger loop structure (which is not shown), the `continue` statement would simply skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the `continue` statement does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 3. If `dp[300011][0]` is less than `dp[300010][0]`, then `dp[300011]` is updated to `(dp[300010][0], dp[300010][1], dp[300010][2])`. Otherwise, `dp[300011]` remains unchanged.**
