The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300012.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified).
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples.
- The current value of `dp[i][0]` is less than the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`.

After executing the code:
- `dp[i]` is now equal to `dp[i - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `dp[i]` is now equal to `dp[i - 1]`, and the current value of `dp[i][0]` is less than the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` (before the update).**
