To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists, and the list at index `n` is now reversed.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to 3 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is between 1 and 3.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently `n`, for the next iteration, `i` must be `n + 1`.
- **Check Range**: The loop will continue if `i` is within the range 1 to 3. Therefore, `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` remains an integer read from input.
- `data` remains a list of 4 lists, with the list at index `n` reversed.
- `w` and `c` remain input integers.
- `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is now reversed, `w` and `c` are input integers, `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3**.
