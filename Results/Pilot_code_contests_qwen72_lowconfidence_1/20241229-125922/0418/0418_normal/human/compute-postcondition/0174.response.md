The code `dp[i] = dp[i - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` remains 300012.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` remains a list of 4 lists (potentially modified).
- `w` and `c` remain input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples.
- `val` remains `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`.
- `j` remains 2.
- The values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged unless the condition `val > dp[i][0]` was met in a previous step, but this condition is not evaluated here.

The only change is in the `dp` list:
- `dp[300012]` is now set to the value of `dp[300011]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` is 2, `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged, `dp[300012]` is `dp[300011]`.**
