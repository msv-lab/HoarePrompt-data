Functionality: ** The function reads input consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of pairs `(wi, ci)` representing the weight and cost of each souvenir. It processes this input to find the maximum total cost of souvenirs that can be selected under the constraint that the total weight does not exceed `m`. The function categorizes the souvenirs into groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3) and sorts these groups in descending order of cost. It then uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible cost for each possible weight up to `m`. Finally, it calculates the maximum cost by considering the best combinations of souvenirs of weight 3 and the results from the dynamic programming table. The function prints the maximum total cost of the selected souvenirs. Edge cases and missing functionality include handling invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values), and ensuring that the input constraints are strictly enforced (e.g., `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 300000`). Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `m` is less than the smallest weight (1), which could lead to incorrect results. **
