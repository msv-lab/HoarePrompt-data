The value of `a2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `a2` was `dp[300008][2]`, so the new value of `a2` is `dp[300008][2] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a0` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300008][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300008][2] + 1`**
