To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing the tuples `(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, 300010):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 300010.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010, so `i` is also less than 300010.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n + 2`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `n + 2`.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer less than 300010.
- `m` remains an integer read from input.
- `data` remains a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` remain input integers.
- `dp` remains a list containing the tuples `(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010, `i` is `n + 2`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing the tuples `(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)`**
