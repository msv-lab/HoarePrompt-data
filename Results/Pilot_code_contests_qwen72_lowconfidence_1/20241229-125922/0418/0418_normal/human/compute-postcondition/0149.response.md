The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples. If `dp[i][0]` is less than `dp[i - 1][0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, and the current iteration is skipped.**
