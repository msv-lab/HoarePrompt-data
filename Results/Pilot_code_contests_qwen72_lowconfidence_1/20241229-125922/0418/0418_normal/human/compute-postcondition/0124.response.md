Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `j` is 3. If `val` is defined and greater than `dp[i][0]`, an `IndexError` is raised due to accessing an empty list. Otherwise, if `val` is not defined, a `NameError` is raised.***
