The code snippet reads two integers, `w` and `c`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `w` and `c` respectively. The initial state provides that `w` and `c` are input integers, and this operation updates their values. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
