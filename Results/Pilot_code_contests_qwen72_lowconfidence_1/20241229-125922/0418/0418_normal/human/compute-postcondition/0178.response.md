The code snippet `ans = dp[w][0]` assigns the value of `dp[w][0]` to the variable `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

- `ans` is now equal to `dp[w][0]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `w`, `c`, and `dp` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `ans` is equal to `dp[w][0]`.**
