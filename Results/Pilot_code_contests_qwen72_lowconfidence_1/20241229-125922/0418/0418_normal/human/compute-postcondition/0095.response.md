Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. If `val` > `dp[i][0]`, `dp[300011]` is updated to `(a0, a1, a2)`, where `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, if `j` is 1, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1] + 1` and `a2` is `dp[300011 - j][2]`, if `j` is not 1, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]` and `a2` is `dp[300011 - j][2] + 1`. If `val` â‰¤ `dp[i][0]`, `dp[300011]` remains unchanged.***
