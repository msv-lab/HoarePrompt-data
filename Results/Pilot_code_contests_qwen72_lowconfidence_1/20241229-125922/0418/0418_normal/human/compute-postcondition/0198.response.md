Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's determine the output state:

- `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + data[3][2]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples.
- `ans` is initially unchanged or updated based on the condition in the loop body.
- The condition `(i + 1) * 3 > w` determines whether we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The code snippet:
```python
ans = sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]
```

Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Calculate `i + 1`:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `i + 1` is 3.

2. **Calculate `3 * (i + 1)`:**
   - `3 * (i + 1)` is `3 * 3` which is 9.

3. **Calculate `w - 3 * (i + 1)`:**
   - `w - 9` is the index used to access the `dp` list.

4. **Access `dp[w - 9][0]`:**
   - `dp[w - 9][0]` is the first element of the tuple at index `w - 9` in the `dp` list.

5. **Update `ans`:**
   - `ans` is assigned the value of `sum + dp[w - 9][0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + data[3][2]`, `ans` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + data[3][2] + dp[w - 9][0]`, `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2. If `(i + 1) * 3 > w`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
