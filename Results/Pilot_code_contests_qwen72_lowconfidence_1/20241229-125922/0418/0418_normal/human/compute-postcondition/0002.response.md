To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from input.
   - `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 up to `n-1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 before the loop begins.

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` remains as an integer read from input.
   - `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists.**
