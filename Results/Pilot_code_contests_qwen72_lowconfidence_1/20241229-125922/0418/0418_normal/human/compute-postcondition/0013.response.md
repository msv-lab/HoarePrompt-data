The code `data[i].sort()` sorts the list located at index `i` in the `data` list. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the list at `data[n]` is sorted. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `w`, or `c`. It only affects the order of elements in the list at `data[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is sorted, `w` and `c` are input integers.**
