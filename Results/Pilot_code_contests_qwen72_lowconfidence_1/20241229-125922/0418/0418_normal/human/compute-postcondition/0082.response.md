The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` remains 300011.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to 300011.
- `data` remains a list of 4 lists, each initially empty.
- `w` and `c` remain input integers.
- `dp` remains a list containing 300011 tuples, each tuple initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
- `dp[300010][0]` remains the maximum value calculated by the loop.
- `dp[300010][1]` remains the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
- `dp[300010][2]` remains the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.
- The condition that either `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each tuple initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, and either `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
