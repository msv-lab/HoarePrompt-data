To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300010.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples.
- `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop.
- `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
- `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 300010. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: The next value of `i` will be 300011. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 300011.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be incremented to 300011.
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 300011 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples. `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.**
