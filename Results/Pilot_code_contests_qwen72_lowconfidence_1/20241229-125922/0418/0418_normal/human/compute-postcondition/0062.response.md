The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 300010, so this means `dp[300010]` is set to the value of `dp[300009]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300010
- `m` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, where `dp[300010]` is now the same as `dp[300009]`
- `j` is 2
- `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, where `dp[300010]` is the same as `dp[300009]`, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`**
