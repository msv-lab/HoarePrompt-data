Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples. The current value of `dp[i][0]` is less than the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`. If `val` > `dp[i][0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `(a0, a1, a2)`, where if `j` is 1, `a0` is `dp[i - 1][0] + data[1][dp[i - 1][1]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - 1][1] + 1`, and `a2` is `dp[i - 1][2]`; otherwise, if `j` is not 1, `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]`, and `a2` is `dp[i - j][2] + 1`. If `val` â‰¤ `dp[i][0]`, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
