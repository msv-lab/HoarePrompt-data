The value of `a1` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j][1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 300010 and `j` is 3, so `i - j` is 300007. Therefore, `a1` is assigned the value of `dp[300007][1]`.

The updated state includes this new assignment while keeping all other initial conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 3, `val` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a0` is `dp[300007][0] + data[3][dp[300007][3]]`, `a1` is `dp[300007][1]`.**
