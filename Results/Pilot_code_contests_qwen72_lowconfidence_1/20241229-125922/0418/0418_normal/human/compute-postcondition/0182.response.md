The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block. Since no specific loop or condition is mentioned in the context, we assume this `break` is part of a loop or conditional structure that is not fully detailed here. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is altered to exit the loop or conditional block.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `ans` is equal to `dp[w][0]`, `sum` is 0, and `data[3]` must have at least one element. Additionally, `(i + 1) * 3 > w`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
