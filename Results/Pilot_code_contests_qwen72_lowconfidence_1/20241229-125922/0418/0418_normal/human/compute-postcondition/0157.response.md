Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` remains 2, `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300010][1] + 1` if `j == 1`; otherwise, `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`, and `a2` is `dp[300010][2] + 1` if `j != 1`; otherwise, `a2` is `dp[300010][2]`.***
