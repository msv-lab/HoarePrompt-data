The code `dp[i] = a0, a1, a2` updates the tuple at index `i` in the list `dp` with the values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300010
- `m` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`
- `j` is 1 or not 1
- `val` is `data[1][0]`
- The current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp`
- `a0` is `data[1][0]`
- If `j` is 1, `a1` is 1 and `a2` is 0
- If `j` is not 1, `a1` is 0 and `a2` is 1

The values of `a0`, `a1`, and `a2` are:
- `a0` is `data[1][0]`
- `a1` is 1 if `j` is 1, otherwise `a1` is 0
- `a2` is 0 if `j` is 1, otherwise `a2` is 1

The tuple at index `i` in `dp` is updated to `(a0, a1, a2)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300010
- `m` is greater than 0
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, where the tuple at index `i` is now `(data[1][0], 1 if j is 1 else 0, 0 if j is 1 else 1)`
- `j` is 1 or not 1
- `val` is `data[1][0]`
- The current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp`
- `a0` is `data[1][0]`

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, where the tuple at index `i` is now `(data[1][0], 1 if j is 1 else 0, 0 if j is 1 else 1)`, `j` is 1 or not 1, `val` is `data[1][0]`, `a0` is `data[1][0]`**
