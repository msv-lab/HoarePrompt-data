Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`, `j` is not 1, `val` is `data[1][0]`, the current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp`, `a0` is `data[1][0]`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0***
