Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. `i` is 300010. `m` must be greater than 0. `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop. `w` and `c` are input integers. `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`. `j` is 1. `val` is `data[1][0]`. The current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp` (i.e., `val > dp[i][0]`).***
