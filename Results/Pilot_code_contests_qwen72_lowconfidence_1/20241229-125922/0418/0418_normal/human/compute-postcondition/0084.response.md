To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
val = dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `dp`: A list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
   - `i`: Set to 300011.
   - `j`: Not explicitly defined in the code snippet, but it is assumed to be a variable used in a loop or context outside this snippet.
   - `data`: A list of 4 lists, each initially empty.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `i - j`: This expression calculates the difference between `i` and `j`.
   - `dp[i - j]`: Accesses the tuple at index `i - j` in the `dp` list.
   - `dp[i - j][0]`: Accesses the first element of the tuple at index `i - j`.
   - `dp[i - j][j]`: Accesses the `j`-th element of the tuple at index `i - j`.
   - `data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`: Accesses the element at index `dp[i - j][j]` in the `j`-th list of `data`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - If `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`val`**: This variable is assigned the value of `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`.

### Calculation:
- **Assumptions:**
  - `i` is 300011.
  - `j` is a variable used in a loop, and its value is not specified.
  - `dp[i - j][0]` is the first element of the tuple at index `i - j`.
  - `dp[i - j][j]` is the `j`-th element of the tuple at index `i - j`.
  - `data[j][dp[i - j][j]]` is the element at index `dp[i - j][j]` in the `j`-th list of `data`.

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is a non-negative integer.
  - `i` is 300011.
  - `m` is greater than or equal to 300011.
  - `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty.
  - `w` and `c` are input integers.
  - `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`.
  - `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop.
  - `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination.
  - `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.
  - If `i - j` is less than 0, or `dp[i - j][j]` is greater than or equal to the length of `data[j]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

- **New State:**
  - `val` is assigned the value of `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `val` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`.**
