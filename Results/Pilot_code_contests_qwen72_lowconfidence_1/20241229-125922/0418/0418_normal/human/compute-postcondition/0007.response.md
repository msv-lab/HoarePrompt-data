The code snippet `data[w].append(c)` appends the integer `c` to the list located at index `w` within the `data` list.

- The value of `n` remains greater than 1.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `m` remains an integer read from input.
- The structure of `data` remains a list containing 4 lists, but the list at index `w` now contains an additional element, `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c, c]` (assuming `c` was the only element before), `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.** However, more accurately, since the initial state specifies that the list at index `w` was `[c]`, after appending `c` again, the list at index `w` will be `[c, c]`.

Corrected Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c, c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
