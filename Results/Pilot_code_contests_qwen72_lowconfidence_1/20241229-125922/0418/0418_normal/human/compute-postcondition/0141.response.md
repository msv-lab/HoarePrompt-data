The value of `a2` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `a2` was `dp[i - j][2]`. After the increment, `a2` becomes `dp[i - j][2] + 1`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300012.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified).
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples.
- `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`.
- `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]`.
- `j` is not equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]`, `a2` is `dp[i - j][2] + 1`, `j` is not equal to 1**
