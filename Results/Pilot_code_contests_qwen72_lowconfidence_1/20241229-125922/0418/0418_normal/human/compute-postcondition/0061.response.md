Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `val` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`. If `val` > `dp[300010][0]`, then `dp[300010]` is updated to the tuple `(a0, a1, a2)` where `a0` is `dp[300008][0] + data[2][dp[300008][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300008][1]`, and `a2` is `dp[300008][2] + 1`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
