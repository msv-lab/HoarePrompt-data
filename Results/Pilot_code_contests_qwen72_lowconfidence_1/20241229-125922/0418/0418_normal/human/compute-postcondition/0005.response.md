To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is an integer read from input.
   - `data` is a list containing 4 lists, where the list at index `w` contains the integer `c`.
   - `w` and `c` are integers read from input.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`i`**: The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - **`n`**: For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than `i` (which will be 1). Thus, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains a list of 4 lists, with the list at index `w` containing `[c]`.
   - `w` and `c` remain the same integers read from input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 lists where the list at index `w` is `[c]`, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
