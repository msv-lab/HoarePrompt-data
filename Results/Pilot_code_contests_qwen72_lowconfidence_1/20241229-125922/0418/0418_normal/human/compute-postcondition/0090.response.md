The code snippet increments the value of `a1` by 1. Since the initial value of `a1` is `dp[i - j][1]`, after executing the code, `a1` will be `dp[i - j][1] + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `val` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, `a0` is `dp[i - j][0] + data[j][dp[i - j][j]]`, `a1` is `dp[i - j][1] + 1`, `a2` is `dp[300011 - j][2]`, `j` is 1.**
