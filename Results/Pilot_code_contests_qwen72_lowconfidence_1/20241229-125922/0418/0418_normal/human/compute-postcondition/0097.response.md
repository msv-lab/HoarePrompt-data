The line of code `dp[i] = dp[i - 1]` updates the tuple at index `i` in the `dp` list to be the same as the tuple at index `i - 1`. This means that the values of `dp[i][0]`, `dp[i][1]`, and `dp[i][2]` will now be the same as those at `dp[i - 1][0]`, `dp[i - 1][1]`, and `dp[i - 1][2]`, respectively.

Given the initial state, the specific impacts are as follows:
- `dp[i][0]` was previously less than `dp[i - 1][0]`, but now it is equal to `dp[i - 1][0]`.
- `dp[i][1]` and `dp[i][2]` are updated to the values of `dp[i - 1][1]` and `dp[i - 1][2]`.

Therefore, the updated values reflect the changes in the `dp` list while maintaining the other conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300011, `m` is greater than or equal to 300011, `data` is a list of 4 lists, each initially empty, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300011 tuples, each initially set to `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300010][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[300010][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, `dp[300010][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination, `dp[i][0]` is now equal to `dp[i - 1][0]`, `dp[i][1]` is now equal to `dp[i - 1][1]`, `dp[i][2]` is now equal to `dp[i - 1][2]`.**
