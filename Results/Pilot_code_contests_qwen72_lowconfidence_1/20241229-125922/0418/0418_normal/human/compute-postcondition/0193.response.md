Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`. If `ans < sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`, then `ans` is updated to `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + dp[w - 6][0]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
