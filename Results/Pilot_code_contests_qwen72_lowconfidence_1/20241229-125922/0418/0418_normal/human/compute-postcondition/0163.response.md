The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. However, it affects the flow of the program, particularly within loops.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `w`, `c`, `dp`, `val`, and `j` retain their initial values. The only effect is that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` is 2, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
