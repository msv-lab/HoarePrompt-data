The code appends a tuple `(0, 0, 0)` to the list `dp`. This changes the length and the last element of `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010, `i` is `n + 2`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing the tuples `(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)`**
