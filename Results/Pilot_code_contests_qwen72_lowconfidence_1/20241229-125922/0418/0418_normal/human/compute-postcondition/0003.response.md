The code `w, c = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `w` and `c`.

- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `m` remains an integer read from input.
- `data` remains a list containing 4 empty lists.
- `w` and `c` are now assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list containing 4 empty lists, `w` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.**
