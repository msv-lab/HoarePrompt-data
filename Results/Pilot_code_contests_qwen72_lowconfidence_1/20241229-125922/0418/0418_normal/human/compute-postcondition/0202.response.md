The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters within its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it implicitly expects input in a specific format. The input consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 300000`. Following these, there are `n` lines, each containing two integers `wi` and `ci`, where `1 ≤ wi ≤ 3` and `1 ≤ ci ≤ 109`, representing the weight and cost of the ith souvenir, respectively.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically, functions of this nature would return a result based on the processing of the input data. Since the exact output is not specified, I'll assume the function processes the input to compute some value or result related to the souvenirs' weights and costs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input in the form of `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of pairs `(wi, ci)` representing the weight and cost of each souvenir, and then return a result based on the processing of this input.
