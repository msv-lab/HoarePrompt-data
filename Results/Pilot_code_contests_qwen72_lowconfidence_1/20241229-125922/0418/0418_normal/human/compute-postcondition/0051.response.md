The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. This does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, it affects the flow of the loop, which might indirectly influence the values in subsequent iterations.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the flow control of the loop, and no variables are directly modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `a0` is set to `data[1][0]` if `data[1][0]` is greater than `dp[i][0]` after the update, otherwise `a0` remains unchanged.**
