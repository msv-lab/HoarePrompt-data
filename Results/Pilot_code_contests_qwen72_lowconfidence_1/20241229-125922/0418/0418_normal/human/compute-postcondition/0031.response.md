To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state:

Given for loop:
```python
for j in range(1, 3):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will iterate over the values from 1 to 2 (inclusive). The loop will execute if the range from 1 to 3 is valid, which it always is because it includes the values 1 and 2.

Now, let's consider the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300010
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`

The loop itself does not depend on `n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `w`, `c`, or `dp`. The loop will execute regardless of these variables as long as the range is valid, which it is.

However, if we need to ensure that the loop can execute and that the variables are in a consistent state, we should ensure that the loop counter `j` starts at 1 and the loop will run for two iterations (from 1 to 2).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `j` should be 1 (the starting value of the loop)
- The loop will run for two iterations, so no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0), j is 1`**
