The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` based on the sum of `data[3][0]` and the first element of the tuple at index `w - 3 * (i + 1)` in the `dp` list. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` is updated to the value of `sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`.
- The value of `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`.
- The value of `i` is 1.
- The value of `w` and `c` are input integers, but they are not directly modified by this code snippet.
- The value of `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, where each tuple represents the best combination for a given index `w`.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`, `ans` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + dp[w - 6][0]`**.
