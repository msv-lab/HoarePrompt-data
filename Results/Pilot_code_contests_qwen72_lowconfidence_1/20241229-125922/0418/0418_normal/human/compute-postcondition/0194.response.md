To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples.
- `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`.
- If `ans < sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]`, then `ans` is updated to `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + dp[w - 6][0]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, len(data[3])):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(data[3])`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `data[3]` contains at least 2 elements (since `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`).

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
- **Check `len(data[3])`**: For the loop to execute again, `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2).

### Updated State:
- `i` is 2.
- `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`, `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2, `ans` remains unchanged or updated based on the condition in the loop body.**
