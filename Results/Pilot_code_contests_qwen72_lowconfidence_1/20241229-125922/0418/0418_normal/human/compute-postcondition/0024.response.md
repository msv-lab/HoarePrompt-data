The code snippet `dp.append((0, 0, 0))` adds a tuple `(0, 0, 0)` to the list `dp`. This changes the state of `dp` from being an empty list to containing one element, which is the tuple `(0, 0, 0)`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `w`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 300010, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0, 0)`**
