The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since no loops or conditions are explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, it is assumed that the `break` is part of a loop or condition that is not shown. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is altered.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1]`, `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2, `ans` remains unchanged or updated based on the condition in the loop body, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
