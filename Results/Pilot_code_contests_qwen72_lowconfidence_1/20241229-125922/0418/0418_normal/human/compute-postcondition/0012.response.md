To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains the integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(1, 4)` will iterate over the values 1, 2, and 3. This means the loop will execute if the range is valid, which it always is because it starts at 1 and ends at 3.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: The initial state of `i` is given as `n`. However, this initial value of `i` is not used in the loop because the loop reassigns `i` to the values 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the initial value of `i` (which is `n`) does not affect the loop execution.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `m` is an integer read from input, but it is not used in the loop condition or initialization.
   - `data` is a list of 4 lists, but its content is not relevant to the loop condition or initialization.
   - `w` and `c` are input integers, but they are not used in the loop condition or initialization.

### Conclusion:
The only requirement for the loop to execute is that the range `range(1, 4)` is valid, which it always is. Therefore, no adjustments to the initial state are necessary for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Since the loop will always execute regardless of the initial state of `i`, `n`, `m`, `data`, `w`, and `c`, the state remains as given:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains the integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers.**
