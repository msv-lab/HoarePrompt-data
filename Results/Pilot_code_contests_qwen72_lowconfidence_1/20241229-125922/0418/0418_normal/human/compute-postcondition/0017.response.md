The code snippet `data[i].reverse()` reverses the list at index `i` in the `data` list. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` is an integer read from input (not affected).
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed and the list at index `i` is sorted.
- `w` and `c` are input integers (not affected).
- `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3.

After executing the code:

- The list at index `i` in `data` is now reversed.
- The list at index `n` remains reversed.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed and the list at index `i` is reversed, `w` and `c` are input integers, `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3**
