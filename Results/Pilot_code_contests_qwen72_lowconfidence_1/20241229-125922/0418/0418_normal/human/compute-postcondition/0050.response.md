To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 300010.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples.
- If `dp[i][0]` is less than `dp[i - 1][0]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i - 1]`.
- If `data[1][0]` is greater than `dp[i][0]` after this update, `dp[i]` is further updated to `(data[1][0], 1 if j is 1 else 0, 0 if j is 1 else 1)`, `j` remains 1 or changes to not 1, and `a0` is set to `data[1][0]`.
- If `dp[i][0]` is not less than `dp[i - 1][0]`, the state of the program remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(1, 3):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration Variable (`j`)**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `1` to `3` (exclusive), so `j` takes values 1 and 2.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `data`, `dp`, `a0`) do not change as a result of the loop iteration itself. They remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300010, `m` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples, `j` is 2, `a0` is set to `data[1][0]` if `data[1][0]` is greater than `dp[i][0]` after the update, otherwise `a0` remains unchanged.**
