The code snippet `data[i].sort()` sorts the list located at index `i` in the `data` list.

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `m` is an integer read from input.
- `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is already reversed.
- `w` and `c` are input integers.
- `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3.

Given these conditions, the list at index `i` (which is `n + 1`) in `data` is sorted. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the list at index `n` is reversed and the list at index `i` is sorted, `w` and `c` are input integers, `n + 1` must be less than or equal to 3**
