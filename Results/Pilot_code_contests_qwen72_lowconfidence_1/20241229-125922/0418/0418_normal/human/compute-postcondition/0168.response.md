The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i - j][2]` to `a2`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 300012
- `j` is 2

So, `i - j` evaluates to `300012 - 2`, which is `300010`.

Therefore, `a2` is assigned the value of `dp[300010][2]`.

The updated state of the variables is:

- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 300012
- `m` is greater than or equal to 300012
- `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified)
- `w` and `c` are input integers
- `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples
- `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`
- `j` is 2
- `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`
- `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`
- `a2` is `dp[300010][2]`

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 300012, `m` is greater than or equal to 300012, `data` is a list of 4 lists (potentially modified), `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list of 300011 tuples, `val` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `j` is 2, `a0` is `dp[300010][0] + data[2][dp[300010][2]]`, `a1` is `dp[300010][1]`, `a2` is `dp[300010][2]`**
