Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples, `sum` is `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + data[3][2]`, `len(data[3])` must be greater than 2, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `data[3][0] + data[3][1] + data[3][2] + dp[w - 9][0]` if `ans < sum + dp[w - 9][0]`. If `(i + 1) * 3 > w`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
