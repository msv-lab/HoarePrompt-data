The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i - j][1]` to the variable `a1`. Given that `i` is 300010 and `j` is 1, `i - j` evaluates to 300009. Since `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`, `dp[300009]` is the tuple `(0, 0, 0)`. Therefore, `a1` is assigned the value of the second element of this tuple, which is `0`.

The rest of the variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer. `i` is 300010. `m` must be greater than 0. `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop. `w` and `c` are input integers. `dp` is a list containing 300010 tuples of `(0, 0, 0)`. `j` is 1. `val` is `data[1][0]`. The current value of `val` is greater than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `dp`. `a0` is `data[1][0]`. `a1` is 0.**
