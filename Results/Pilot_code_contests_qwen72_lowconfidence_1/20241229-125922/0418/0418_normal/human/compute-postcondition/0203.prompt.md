You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000. There are n lines following the first line, each containing two integers wi and ci, where 1 ≤ wi ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109, representing the weight and cost of the ith souvenir, respectively.
def func():
    data = [[] for i in range(4)]
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(0, n):
        w, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        data[w].append(c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains the integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers.
    for i in range(1, 4):
        data[i].sort()
        
        data[i].reverse()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the changes it makes to the variables. Let's break down the loop step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` is a non-negative integer.
    #- `i` is `n`.
    #- `m` is an integer read from input.
    #- `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop.
    #- `w` and `c` are input integers.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(1, 4):
    #    data[i].sort()
    #    data[i].reverse()
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 3` (inclusive).
    #   - For each iteration, the list at index `i` in `data` is sorted and then reversed.
    #
    #2. **Changes to Variables**:
    #   - `n` remains a non-negative integer and is not modified by the loop.
    #   - `i` is a loop variable that ranges from 1 to 3 and is not related to the initial `i` (which is `n`).
    #   - `m` remains an integer read from input and is not modified by the loop.
    #   - `data` is modified such that the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 are sorted and then reversed.
    #   - `w` and `c` remain input integers and are not modified by the loop.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- After the loop completes, the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 in `data` will be sorted and then reversed. This means they will be in descending order.
    #- The list at index 0 in `data` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies indices 1, 2, and 3.
    #
    #### Conclusion:
    #The final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
    #**`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `m` is an integer read from input, `data` is a list of 4 lists where the lists at indices 1, 2, and 3 are in descending order, and the list at index 0 is unchanged, `w` and `c` are input integers.**

        for j in range(1, 3):
            if i - j < 0 or dp[i - j][j] >= len(data[j]):
                continue

Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the largest integer such that `(i + 1) * 3 <= w` or 0 if the loop did not execute, `m` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list of 4 lists where each list at index `w` contains integers `c` that were appended during the loop, `w` and `c` are input integers, `dp` is a list containing `m + 1` tuples. Each tuple `dp[i]` for `i` from 0 to `m` contains the maximum value, count of elements from `data[1]`, and count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination for that index. Specifically, `dp[m][0]` is the maximum value calculated by the loop, `dp[m][1]` is the count of elements from `data[1]` used in the best combination, and `dp[m][2]` is the count of elements from `data[2]` used in the best combination. `sum` is the sum of the first `i + 1` elements of `data[3]` or 0 if the loop did not execute. `ans` is the maximum value between the initial `ans` and the value `sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]` for all valid `i`. If the loop did not execute, `sum` remains 0 and `ans` retains its initial value.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes input consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of pairs `(wi, ci)` representing the weight and cost of each souvenir, and returns a result based on the processing of this input.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
