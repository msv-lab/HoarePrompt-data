Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements a solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of souvenirs (`n`) and the maximum weight (`m`) that Petya can carry.
   - It then reads the weights and costs of each souvenir and stores them in a list of lists called `data`, where `data[w]` contains the costs of all souvenirs with weight `w`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The program sorts and reverses the lists in `data` for weights 1, 2, and 3. This ensures that for each weight, the most expensive souvenirs are considered first, which helps in maximizing the total cost.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - A dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `[0, 0, 0]` for each possible weight up to `m`. The DP table keeps track of the maximum total cost (`dp[i][0]`), the number of souvenirs of weight 1 used (`dp[i][1]`), and the number of souvenirs of weight 2 used (`dp[i][2]`).

4. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The program iterates over each possible weight from 1 to `m` and for each weight, it considers adding a souvenir of weight 1 or 2.
   - It updates the DP table to reflect the maximum total cost that can be achieved by including the current souvenir, ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the current weight `i`.

5. **Handling Weight 3 Souvenirs**:
   - After filling the DP table, the program iterates over the souvenirs with weight 3 to see if including them can further increase the total cost.
   - It calculates the new total cost by adding the cost of the current weight 3 souvenir to the maximum cost for the remaining weight and updates the answer accordingly.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum total cost that can be achieved, which is stored in the variable `ans`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description:
- It reads the input correctly and processes it efficiently.
- It uses a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum total cost of souvenirs that can be carried without exceeding the weight limit.
- It ensures that the most valuable souvenirs are considered first, which helps in maximizing the total cost.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
