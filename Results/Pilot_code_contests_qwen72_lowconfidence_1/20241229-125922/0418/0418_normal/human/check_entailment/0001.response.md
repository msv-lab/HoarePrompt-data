Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Variable `w` is undefined**: In the final loop, the variable `w` is used, but it is never defined in the scope of the function. This will cause a runtime error. The correct variable should be `m`.

2. **Incorrect handling of `data[3]` items**: The logic for handling items with weight 3 is flawed. The loop that processes items with weight 3 should be more carefully integrated into the dynamic programming approach to ensure that the maximum cost is correctly calculated.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the total weight `m` is less than the smallest weight of any souvenir. For example, if `m` is 1 and all souvenirs have a weight of 2 or 3, the program should output 0, but it may not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
3 1
2 5
3 10
3 15
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

The program will fail because it will encounter an undefined variable `w` and may not correctly handle the fact that no souvenirs can be taken due to the weight constraint.

These issues indicate that the program is not correct for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
