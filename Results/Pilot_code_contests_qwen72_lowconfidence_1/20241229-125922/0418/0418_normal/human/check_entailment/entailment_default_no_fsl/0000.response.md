Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the total weight `m` is less than the smallest weight of any souvenir (which is 1 according to the problem constraints). In such a case, the program should output 0 because no souvenirs can be carried. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this condition and may produce incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 1
2 1
```
The correct output should be `0` because the only souvenir available has a weight of 2, which exceeds the total weight `m` of 1. Therefore, no souvenirs can be carried, and the total cost should be 0. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly and may produce an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause a runtime error if the program is run in Python 3, which is a common environment. While the problem statement assumes valid input, it is important to ensure compatibility with the version of Python being used.
