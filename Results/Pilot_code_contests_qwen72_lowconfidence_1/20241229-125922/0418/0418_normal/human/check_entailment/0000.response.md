Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when the input values for `n` and `m` are at their upper limits correctly due to an indexing error in the final output calculation. Specifically, the variable `w` is used in the final part of the code (`dp[w][0]` and `w - 3 * (i + 1)`), but `w` is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems like `w` should be `m`, the total weight Petya can carry. This would cause the program to fail when `m` is large, as it would result in an index out of bounds error or incorrect results.

Here's the problematic part of the code:
```python
ans = dp[w][0]
sum = 0
for i in range(0, len(data[3])):
    if (i + 1) * 3 > w:
        break
    sum += data[3][i]
    if ans < sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]:
        ans = sum + dp[w - 3 * (i + 1)][0]
print(ans)
```

It should be:
```python
ans = dp[m][0]
sum = 0
for i in range(0, len(data[3])):
    if (i + 1) * 3 > m:
        break
    sum += data[3][i]
    if ans < sum + dp[m - 3 * (i + 1)][0]:
        ans = sum + dp[m - 3 * (i + 1)][0]
print(ans)
```

This correction ensures that the program correctly handles the maximum possible total cost for all valid inputs.
