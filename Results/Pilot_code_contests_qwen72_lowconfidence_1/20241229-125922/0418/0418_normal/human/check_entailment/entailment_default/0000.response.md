Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a dynamic programming approach, which is generally a good strategy for this type of knapsack-like problem. However, there are a few issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Handling of `m` Less Than the Smallest Weight**: The program does not handle the case where `m` is less than the smallest weight (which is 1). In such a case, the maximum total cost should be 0 because no souvenirs can be carried. The current implementation does not explicitly check for this condition, which could lead to incorrect results.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized with a tuple `(0, 0, 0)` for each possible weight up to `m`. However, the initialization of the table is not necessary for the first dimension (total cost), and the other dimensions (counts of weights 1 and 2) are not used effectively in the final result calculation.

3. **Final Calculation of Maximum Cost**: The final calculation of the maximum cost involves iterating over the souvenirs of weight 3 and combining them with the results from the dynamic programming table. This part of the code is complex and could potentially miss optimal solutions or double-count some costs.

4. **Edge Cases and Input Constraints**: While the problem description specifies that the input will be valid, the program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `m` is exactly 1 and there are no souvenirs of weight 1, or when `m` is exactly 2 and there are no souvenirs of weight 2. These edge cases could lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
