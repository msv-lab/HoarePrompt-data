You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are "a", "o", "u", "i", and "e". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant "n"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words "harakiri", "yupie", "man", and "nbo" are Berlanese while the words "horse", "king", "my", and "nz" are not.

Help Vitya find out if a word s is Berlanese.

Input

The first line of the input contains the string s consisting of |s| (1≤ |s|≤ 100) lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

sumimasen


Output

YES


Input

ninja


Output

YES


Input

codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except "n", so the word is Berlanese.

In the third sample, the consonant "c" goes after the consonant "r", and the consonant "s" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
