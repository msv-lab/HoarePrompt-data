Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the letter 'n' is followed by a consonant or is at the end of the word. According to the problem description, after the consonant 'n', there can be any letter or no letter at all. However, the current implementation does not account for this exception. 

For example, consider the word "nza":
- The program will incorrectly return "NO" because it checks for a vowel after every consonant (except 'n'), but it does not handle the case where 'n' is followed by another consonant correctly. It treats 'n' like any other consonant, which leads to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should include a specific check for the letter 'n' to allow it to be followed by any letter or to be the last character in the word.
