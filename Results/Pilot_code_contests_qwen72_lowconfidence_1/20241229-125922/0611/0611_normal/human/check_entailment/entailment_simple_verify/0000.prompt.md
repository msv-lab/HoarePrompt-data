You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are "a", "o", "u", "i", and "e". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant "n"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words "harakiri", "yupie", "man", and "nbo" are Berlanese while the words "horse", "king", "my", and "nz" are not.

Help Vitya find out if a word s is Berlanese.

Input

The first line of the input contains the string s consisting of |s| (1≤ |s|≤ 100) lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

sumimasen


Output

YES


Input

ninja


Output

YES


Input

codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except "n", so the word is Berlanese.

In the third sample, the consonant "c" goes after the consonant "r", and the consonant "s" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().strip()
    letters = list(map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)))
    vowels = list('aeiou')
    const = list(set(letters) - set(vowels) - set(['n']))
    p = True
    for i in xrange(len(s)):
        if s[i] in const and (i + 1 == len(s) or s[i + 1] not in vowels):
            p = False
            break
    print['NO', 'YES'][p]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the letter 'n' is followed by a consonant or is at the end of the word. According to the problem description, after the consonant 'n', there can be any letter or no letter at all. However, the current implementation does not account for this exception. 

For example, consider the word "nza":
- The program will incorrectly return "NO" because it checks for a vowel after every consonant (except 'n'), but it does not handle the case where 'n' is followed by another consonant correctly. It treats 'n' like any other consonant, which leads to an incorrect output.

To fix this, the program should include a specific check for the letter 'n' to allow it to be followed by any letter or to be the last character in the word.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    s = raw_input().strip()
    letters = list(map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)))
    vowels = list('aeiou')
    const = list(set(letters) - set(vowels) - set(['n']))
    p = True
    for i in xrange(len(s)):
        if s[i] in const and (i + 1 == len(s) or s[i + 1] not in vowels):
            p = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the last index of `s` or the index where the loop condition was met, `letters` is a list containing ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `vowels` is a list containing ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], `const` is a list containing ['b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']. If any character in `s` is a consonant followed by a non-vowel (or the end of the string), then `p` is False. If no such condition is met throughout the string, `p` remains True.
    print['NO', 'YES'][p]


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
