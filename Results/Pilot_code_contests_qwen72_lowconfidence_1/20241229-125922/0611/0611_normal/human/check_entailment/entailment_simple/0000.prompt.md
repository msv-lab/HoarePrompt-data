You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are "a", "o", "u", "i", and "e". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant "n"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words "harakiri", "yupie", "man", and "nbo" are Berlanese while the words "horse", "king", "my", and "nz" are not.

Help Vitya find out if a word s is Berlanese.

Input

The first line of the input contains the string s consisting of |s| (1≤ |s|≤ 100) lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

sumimasen


Output

YES


Input

ninja


Output

YES


Input

codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except "n", so the word is Berlanese.

In the third sample, the consonant "c" goes after the consonant "r", and the consonant "s" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    s = raw_input().strip()
    letters = list(map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)))
    vowels = list('aeiou')
    const = list(set(letters) - set(vowels) - set(['n']))
    p = True
    for i in xrange(len(s)):
        if s[i] in const and (i + 1 == len(s) or s[i + 1] not in vowels):
            p = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `i` is the last index of `s` or the index where the loop condition was met, `letters` is a list containing ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `vowels` is a list containing ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], `const` is a list containing ['b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']. If any character in `s` is a consonant followed by a non-vowel (or the end of the string), then `p` is False. If no such condition is met throughout the string, `p` remains True.
    print['NO', 'YES'][p]

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
