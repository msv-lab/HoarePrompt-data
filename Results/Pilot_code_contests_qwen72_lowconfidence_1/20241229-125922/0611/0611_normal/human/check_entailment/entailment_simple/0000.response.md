Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Handling of the Consonant 'n'**: The problem description states that after the consonant "n", there can be any letter or no letter at all. However, the current implementation does not specifically check for the consonant "n". It treats "n" as any other consonant, which means it incorrectly expects a vowel to follow "n" unless it is the last character in the string.

2. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. While this doesn't affect the correctness in terms of logic, it does make the program incompatible with Python 3, which is a common environment for running such scripts.

3. **List Construction for Vowels and Consonants**: The program constructs the list of consonants by subtracting the set of vowels and the letter 'n' from the set of all lowercase letters. This is correct but could be simplified.

4. **Output Format**: The program uses a list to select between "NO" and "YES" for output, which is unconventional and less readable compared to using an `if-else` statement.

To correct these issues, the program should be modified to explicitly handle the special case for the consonant "n" and ensure compatibility with Python 3. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_berlanese_word():
    s = input().strip()
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    p = True
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in vowels and s[i] != 'n':
            if i + 1 == len(s) or s[i + 1] not in vowels:
                p = False
                break
    print('YES' if p else 'NO')

# Example usage
is_berlanese_word()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: Uses `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
2. **Vowel Check**: Directly checks if a character is a vowel or 'n'.
3. **Special Case for 'n'**: Ensures that 'n' does not require a vowel to follow it.
4. **Output**: Uses a simple `if-else` statement for readability.

With these changes, the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
