You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitya has just started learning Berlanese language. It is known that Berlanese uses the Latin alphabet. Vowel letters are "a", "o", "u", "i", and "e". Other letters are consonant.

In Berlanese, there has to be a vowel after every consonant, but there can be any letter after any vowel. The only exception is a consonant "n"; after this letter, there can be any letter (not only a vowel) or there can be no letter at all. For example, the words "harakiri", "yupie", "man", and "nbo" are Berlanese while the words "horse", "king", "my", and "nz" are not.

Help Vitya find out if a word s is Berlanese.

Input

The first line of the input contains the string s consisting of |s| (1≤ |s|≤ 100) lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

sumimasen


Output

YES


Input

ninja


Output

YES


Input

codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except "n", so the word is Berlanese.

In the third sample, the consonant "c" goes after the consonant "r", and the consonant "s" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.
Program:
```
def func():
    s = raw_input().strip()
    letters = list(map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)))
    vowels = list('aeiou')
    const = list(set(letters) - set(vowels) - set(['n']))
    p = True
    for i in xrange(len(s)):
        if s[i] in const and (i + 1 == len(s) or s[i + 1] not in vowels):
            p = False
            break
    print['NO', 'YES'][p]


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input, which is expected to be a string of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks whether every consonant (excluding 'n') in the string `s` is followed by a vowel. If this condition is met for all characters in the string, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the input string `s`, a list of all lowercase letters `letters`, a list of vowels `vowels`, a list of consonants excluding 'n' `const`, and a boolean `p` indicating whether the condition was met. Edge cases include strings with only vowels, strings with only consonants, and strings of length 1. If the string contains a single consonant that is not 'n', the function will print "NO" because there is no following character to check.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
