Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the string ends with the consonant 'n'. According to the problem description, a word is still considered Berlanese if it ends with 'n', even if there is no following vowel. However, the current implementation of the code will incorrectly mark such a word as "NO" because it checks if the next character after a consonant (including 'n') is a vowel, which fails when 'n' is the last character.

For example, the word "n" should be considered Berlanese, but the program will output "NO" for this input. Similarly, the word "man" should also be considered Berlanese, but the program will output "NO" because it does not handle the case where 'n' is the last character correctly.
