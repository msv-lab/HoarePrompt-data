The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The values of the variables `i`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the same conditions as the initial state, with the additional information that the loop or conditional block has been exited.

Output State: **`i` is 1, the length of `s` is at least 2, `p` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
