Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input, which is expected to be a string of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks whether every consonant (excluding 'n') in the string `s` is followed by a vowel. If this condition is met for all characters in the string, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the input string `s`, a list of all lowercase letters `letters`, a list of vowels `vowels`, a list of consonants excluding 'n' `const`, and a boolean `p` indicating whether the condition was met. Edge cases include strings with only vowels, strings with only consonants, and strings of length 1. If the string contains a single consonant that is not 'n', the function will print "NO" because there is no following character to check. **
