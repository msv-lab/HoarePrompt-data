The provided function signature does not include any parameters, but the parameter constraints indicate that the function should work with a string `s` of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. However, without the actual function implementation or further details on the expected output, I cannot accurately describe the return value. Typically, in such scenarios, the function might perform some operation on the string `s` and return a result based on that operation. Since the output details are not provided, I will describe the function based on the given parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function is expected to operate on a string `s` of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, though the specific return value is not specified in the provided information.**
