To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `letters` is a list containing all lowercase Latin letters.
   - `vowels` is a list containing ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'].
   - `const` is a list containing all consonants.
   - If the first character of `s` is a consonant and either `s` has only one character or the second character of `s` is not a vowel, then `p` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p` remains True.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in xrange(len(s)):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than the length of `s`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` should be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - The length of `s` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `letters` is a list containing ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'], `vowels` is a list containing ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'], `const` is a list containing ['b', 'c', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']. If the first character of `s` is a consonant and either `s` has only one character or the second character of `s` is not a vowel, then `p` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p` remains True.**
