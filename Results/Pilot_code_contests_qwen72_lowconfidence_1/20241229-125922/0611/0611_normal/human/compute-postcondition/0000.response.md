The code snippet `s = raw_input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user and strips any leading and trailing whitespace characters from it. The value of `s` is updated to this new input string.

Given the initial state where `s` is a string of length 1 to 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, the new value of `s` will be the input string provided by the user, which also consists of lowercase Latin letters, possibly without any leading or trailing spaces (if they existed in the input).

Output State: **`s` is the input string of lowercase Latin letters (possibly without leading or trailing spaces if they were present in the input)**.
