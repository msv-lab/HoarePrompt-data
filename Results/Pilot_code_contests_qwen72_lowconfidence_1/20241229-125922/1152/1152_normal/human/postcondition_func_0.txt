The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function checks if `k` (treated as an integer) is greater than `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function attempts to return the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is an undefined list (or array). Since `c` is not defined in the provided code, the function will raise a `NameError` unless `c` is defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function either returns 0 or raises a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `c`.
