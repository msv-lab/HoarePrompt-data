#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and k is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return c[n][k]
    #The program returns the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is a list (or array) that was not defined in the provided initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `c` is not defined, its value cannot be determined from the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function checks if `k` (treated as an integer) is greater than `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function attempts to return the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is an undefined list (or array). Since `c` is not defined in the provided code, the function will raise a `NameError` unless `c` is defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function either returns 0 or raises a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `c`.
