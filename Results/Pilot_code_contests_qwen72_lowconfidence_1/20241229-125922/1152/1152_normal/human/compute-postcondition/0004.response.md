The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.

The function has the following return behavior:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is a list (or array) that is not defined in the provided initial state. Since `c` is not defined, its value cannot be determined from the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and a list `k` of `n` integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns 0 in one case. In another case, it returns the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is an undefined list (or array), and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.**
