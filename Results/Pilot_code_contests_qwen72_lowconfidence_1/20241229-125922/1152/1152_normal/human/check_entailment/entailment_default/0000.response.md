Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem described. There are several issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of Combinatorial Values**: The combinatorial values `c[n][k]` are precomputed using Pascal's triangle, but the function `func_1(n, k)` incorrectly accesses these values. The problem description requires checking if a subsequence can be split into good arrays, but the way `func_1` is used does not align with this requirement. Specifically, the function `func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])` is intended to check if the subsequence can be split, but it does not correctly handle the conditions for forming a good array.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming (DP) logic in the main part of the code is flawed. The DP array `dp` is supposed to store the number of ways to form good subsequences ending at each index. However, the update rule for `dp[i]` is incorrect. The line `dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])` does not correctly account for the conditions required to form a good array. Specifically, it should check if the subsequence starting at `i` and ending at `j-1` forms a good array, but the current implementation does not enforce this.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the input sequence contains elements that are not suitable for forming a good array (e.g., elements that are too large or too small), the code does not correctly handle these cases. Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case where the sequence cannot be split into good arrays at all.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
