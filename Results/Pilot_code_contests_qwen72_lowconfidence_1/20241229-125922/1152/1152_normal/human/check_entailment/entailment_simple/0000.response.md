### Analysis

Let's break down the program and the problem description to verify if the program meets the requirements:

#### Problem Description Recap
- A sequence of integers is called a good array if the first element \( a_1 \) is equal to \( k - 1 \) and \( a_1 > 0 \).
- A sequence is good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays.
- The task is to count the number of subsequences of the given sequence that are good sequences, and print the result modulo 998244353.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization and Combinatorial Table**:
   ```python
   mod = 998244353
   c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
   c[0][0] = 1
   for i in range(1, 1005):
       c[i][0] = 1
       c[i][i] = 1
       for j in range(1, i):
           c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
           c[i][j] %= mod
   ```
   - This part initializes a combinatorial table `c` which stores binomial coefficients \( \binom{i}{j} \) modulo 998244353. This is used later in the program to calculate combinations.

2. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   n = int(raw_input())
   src = map(int, raw_input().split())
   ```
   - Reads the length `n` and the sequence `src`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   ```python
   dp = [0] * (n + 1)
   dp[n] = 1
   ```
   - Initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of good subsequences starting from index `i` to the end of the sequence.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       if src[i] < 1:
           continue
       for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
           dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
           dp[i] %= mod
   ```
   - Iterates over the sequence in reverse order.
   - Skips elements that are less than 1.
   - For each valid element, it calculates the number of good subsequences that can be formed starting from the current element by considering all possible ending points and using the precomputed combinatorial values.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       if (k > n) :
           return 0
       return c[n][k]
   ```
   - Returns the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \) if \( k \leq n \), otherwise returns 0.

6. **Final Output**:
   ```python
   print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod
   ```
   - Calculates the total number of good subsequences and prints the result modulo 998244353.

### Correctness Verification
- **Combinatorial Table**: The combinatorial table `c` is correctly initialized and precomputed, ensuring efficient access to binomial coefficients.
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input as specified.
- **DP Array Initialization**: The DP array is initialized correctly with `dp[n] = 1` to account for the base case where the entire sequence is considered.
- **DP Calculation**: The DP calculation correctly iterates over the sequence in reverse, skipping invalid elements, and uses the precomputed combinatorial values to count good subsequences.
- **Function `func_1`**: The function correctly returns the binomial coefficient or 0 based on the condition.
- **Final Output**: The final output correctly sums the DP array and subtracts 1 to exclude the empty subsequence, then prints the result modulo 998244353.

### Conclusion
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly counts the number of good subsequences and prints the result modulo 998244353.

Correctness: **True**
