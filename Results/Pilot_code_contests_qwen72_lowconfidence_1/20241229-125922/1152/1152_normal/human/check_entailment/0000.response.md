Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the code and why they seem to handle the requirements:

1. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The `c` array is precomputed using Pascal's triangle to store binomial coefficients, which are used later in the calculation of combinations.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the sequence `n` and the sequence itself `src`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A `dp` array is initialized to store the number of good subsequences ending at each position. `dp[n]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to form a good subsequence from the end of the sequence.

4. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the sequence, checking if the current element `src[i]` can start a good subsequence. If `src[i] < 1`, it skips to the next element.
   - For each valid starting point, it calculates the number of ways to extend the subsequence using the `func_1` function, which returns the binomial coefficient for the given parameters.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The sum of the `dp` array is taken, and 1 is subtracted to exclude the empty subsequence. The result is then taken modulo 998244353.

6. **Helper Function**:
   - `func_1` ensures that the binomial coefficient is only used if the conditions for forming a good subsequence are met (i.e., `k <= n`).

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the requirement that each element belongs to exactly one good subsequence and the modulo operation. Given the complexity and the thorough handling of the combinatorial aspects, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.
