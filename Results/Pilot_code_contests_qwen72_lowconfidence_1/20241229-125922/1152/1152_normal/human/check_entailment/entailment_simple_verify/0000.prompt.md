You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is called a good array if a_1 = k - 1 and a_1 > 0. For example, the sequences [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] are good arrays, and the sequences [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] are good, and the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains the number n~(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n~(-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the sequence itself.

Output

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first test case, two good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3] and [a_2, a_3].

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4] and [a_3, a_4].
Program:
```
mod = 998244353
c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, 1005):
    c[i][0] = 1
    c[i][i] = 1
    for j in range(1, i):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
        c[i][j] %= mod
n = int(raw_input())
src = map(int, raw_input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[n] = 1
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if src[i] < 1:
        continue
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
        dp[i] %= mod
print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    return c[n][k]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the code and why they seem to handle the requirements:

1. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The `c` array is precomputed using Pascal's triangle to store binomial coefficients, which are used later in the calculation of combinations.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the sequence `n` and the sequence itself `src`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A `dp` array is initialized to store the number of good subsequences ending at each position. `dp[n]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to form a good subsequence from the end of the sequence.

4. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the sequence, checking if the current element `src[i]` can start a good subsequence. If `src[i] < 1`, it skips to the next element.
   - For each valid starting point, it calculates the number of ways to extend the subsequence using the `func_1` function, which returns the binomial coefficient for the given parameters.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The sum of the `dp` array is taken, and 1 is subtracted to exclude the empty subsequence. The result is then taken modulo 998244353.

6. **Helper Function**:
   - `func_1` ensures that the binomial coefficient is only used if the conditions for forming a good subsequence are met (i.e., `k <= n`).

The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the requirement that each element belongs to exactly one good subsequence and the modulo operation. Given the complexity and the thorough handling of the combinatorial aspects, it appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
mod = 998244353
c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, 1005):
    c[i][0] = 1
    c[i][i] = 1
    for j in range(1, i):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
        c[i][j] %= mod
n = int(raw_input())
src = map(int, raw_input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[n] = 1
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if src[i] < 1:
        continue
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
        dp[i] %= mod
print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and k is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return c[n][k]
    #The program returns the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is a list (or array) that was not defined in the provided initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `c` is not defined, its value cannot be determined from the given information.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
