Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step using the annotated version of the code:

1. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The `c` array is precomputed using Pascal's triangle to store binomial coefficients. This is correctly implemented:
     ```python
     c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
     c[0][0] = 1
     for i in range(1, 1005):
         c[i][0] = 1
         c[i][i] = 1
         for j in range(1, i):
             c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
             c[i][j] %= mod
     ```
   - The binomial coefficients are computed and stored correctly, ensuring that `c[n][k]` is available for use in the dynamic programming part of the program.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the sequence `n` and the sequence itself `src`:
     ```python
     n = int(raw_input())
     src = map(int, raw_input().split())
     ```
   - The input is assumed to be valid, as per the problem description and the assumption provided.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A `dp` array is initialized to store the number of good subsequences ending at each position. `dp[n]` is set to 1:
     ```python
     dp = [0] * (n + 1)
     dp[n] = 1
     ```

4. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the sequence, checking if the current element `src[i]` can start a good subsequence. If `src[i] < 1`, it skips to the next element:
     ```python
     for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
         if src[i] < 1:
             continue
         for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
             dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
             dp[i] %= mod
     ```
   - For each valid starting point, it calculates the number of ways to extend the subsequence using the `func_1` function, which returns the binomial coefficient for the given parameters.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The sum of the `dp` array is taken, and 1 is subtracted to exclude the empty subsequence. The result is then taken modulo 998244353:
     ```python
     print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod
     ```

6. **Helper Function**:
   - `func_1` ensures that the binomial coefficient is only used if the conditions for forming a good subsequence are met (i.e., `k <= n`):
     ```python
     def func_1(n, k):
         if k > n:
             return 0
         return c[n][k]
     ```

The annotated version of the code confirms that:
- The `c` array is correctly precomputed and used.
- The input is handled correctly.
- The dynamic programming approach is implemented correctly.
- The helper function `func_1` ensures that the binomial coefficient is only used when valid.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all specified constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
