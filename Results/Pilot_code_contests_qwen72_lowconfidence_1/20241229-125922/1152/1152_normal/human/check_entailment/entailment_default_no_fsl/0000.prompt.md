You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is called a good array if a_1 = k - 1 and a_1 > 0. For example, the sequences [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] are good arrays, and the sequences [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] are good, and the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains the number n~(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n~(-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the sequence itself.

Output

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first test case, two good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3] and [a_2, a_3].

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4] and [a_3, a_4].
Program:
```
mod = 998244353
c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, 1005):
    c[i][0] = 1
    c[i][i] = 1
    for j in range(1, i):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
        c[i][j] %= mod
n = int(raw_input())
src = map(int, raw_input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[n] = 1
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if src[i] < 1:
        continue
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
        dp[i] %= mod
print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    return c[n][k]


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function checks if `k` (treated as an integer) is greater than `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function attempts to return the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is an undefined list (or array). Since `c` is not defined in the provided code, the function will raise a `NameError` unless `c` is defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function either returns 0 or raises a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `c`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
