Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement:

1. **Undefined Variable `c`**: The function `func_1` uses the variable `c`, which is defined outside the function. However, the way `c` is used and initialized suggests it is intended to be a Pascal's triangle (binomial coefficients), but the initialization only covers up to `1004` rows. This might lead to out-of-bounds access if `n` exceeds `1004`.

2. **Incorrect Initialization of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to `0` and then `dp[n]` is set to `1`. This initialization is correct for the base case, but the loop that updates `dp` should ensure that all elements are updated correctly. However, the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`, which might miss some necessary updates if the sequence does not meet the conditions for forming good arrays.

3. **Handling of Good Arrays**: The code checks if `src[i] < 1` and skips the iteration if true. This is correct according to the problem description, but the way it handles the formation of good arrays might not be robust enough. Specifically, the condition `if src[i] < 1` ensures that only positive values are considered, but the logic inside the loop might not correctly account for the requirement that `a_1 = k - 1` and `a_1 > 0`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code might not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the input sequence is `[0]` or contains no valid good arrays, the code might not produce the correct output. Additionally, the code does not explicitly check if the sequence can be divided into good arrays as required by the problem statement.

5. **Output Calculation**: The final output is calculated as `(sum(dp) - 1) % mod`. This assumes that `dp[0]` is included in the sum, which might not be correct if the sequence does not form a good array starting from the first element.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
