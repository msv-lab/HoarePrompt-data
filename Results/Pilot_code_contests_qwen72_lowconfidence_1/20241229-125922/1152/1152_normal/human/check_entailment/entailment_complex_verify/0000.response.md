Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The `c` array is precomputed using Pascal's triangle to store binomial coefficients, which are used later in the calculation of combinations. This is correctly implemented and matches the problem requirements.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length of the sequence `n` and the sequence itself `src`. This is done correctly and matches the input format described in the problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - A `dp` array is initialized to store the number of good subsequences ending at each position. `dp[n]` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to form a good subsequence from the end of the sequence. This initialization is correct.

4. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the sequence, checking if the current element `src[i]` can start a good subsequence. If `src[i] < 1`, it skips to the next element.
   - For each valid starting point, it calculates the number of ways to extend the subsequence using the `func_1` function, which returns the binomial coefficient for the given parameters. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The sum of the `dp` array is taken, and 1 is subtracted to exclude the empty subsequence. The result is then taken modulo 998244353. This step is correct and matches the output format described in the problem.

6. **Helper Function**:
   - `func_1` ensures that the binomial coefficient is only used if the conditions for forming a good subsequence are met (i.e., `k <= n`). The function returns 0 if `k > n`, and otherwise returns `c[n][k]`. This is correctly implemented.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context and confirms that the program's state and behavior align with the problem description. The annotations do not indicate any issues with the program's logic or implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate, and the program is indeed correct.
