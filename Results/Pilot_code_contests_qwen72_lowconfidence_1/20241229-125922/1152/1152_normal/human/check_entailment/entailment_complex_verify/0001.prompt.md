You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is called a good array if a_1 = k - 1 and a_1 > 0. For example, the sequences [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] are good arrays, and the sequences [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] are good, and the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains the number n~(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n~(-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the sequence itself.

Output

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.

Examples

Input

2 1 1


Output

2


Input

4
1 1 1 1


Output

7

Note

In the first test case, two good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3] and [a_2, a_3].

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4] and [a_3, a_4].
Program:
```
mod = 998244353
c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, 1005):
    c[i][0] = 1
    c[i][i] = 1
    for j in range(1, i):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
        c[i][j] %= mod
n = int(raw_input())
src = map(int, raw_input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[n] = 1
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if src[i] < 1:
        continue
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
        dp[i] %= mod
print(sum(dp) - 1) % mod

def func_1(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    return c[n][k]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in how it handles the input and processes the sequences to count the number of good subsequences. Specifically, the program uses `raw_input()` which is a function from Python 2, but the problem does not specify the version of Python being used. If the program is intended to run on Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the sequence starts with a value that cannot form a good array. For example, if the sequence starts with a value that is not equal to the length of the sequence minus one, the program may incorrectly count this as part of a good subsequence.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly handle the case where the sequence starts with a value that cannot form a good array.

Thus, the program is incorrect due to these issues.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
mod = 998244353
c = [[0] * 2000 for i in range(2000)]
c[0][0] = 1
for i in range(1, 1005):
    c[i][0] = 1
    c[i][i] = 1
    for j in range(1, i):
        c[i][j] = c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]
        c[i][j] %= mod
n = int(raw_input())
src = map(int, raw_input().split())
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
dp[n] = 1
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if src[i] < 1:
        continue
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        dp[i] += dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])
        dp[i] %= mod

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and k is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k > n) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`.
    return c[n][k]
    #The program returns the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is a list (or array) that was not defined in the provided initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. Since `c` is not defined, its value cannot be determined from the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `k`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function checks if `k` (treated as an integer) is greater than `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, the function attempts to return the value of `c[n][k]`, where `c` is an undefined list (or array). Since `c` is not defined in the provided code, the function will raise a `NameError` unless `c` is defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the function either returns 0 or raises a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `c`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
