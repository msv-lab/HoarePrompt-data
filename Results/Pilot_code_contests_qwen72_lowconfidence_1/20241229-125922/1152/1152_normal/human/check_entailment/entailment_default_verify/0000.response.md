Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The output hints provide critical information that the original assessment did not account for. Specifically, the function `func_1` relies on a precomputed `c` array, which is defined in the provided code. However, the output hints suggest that `c` is an undefined list, which would lead to a `NameError` if `c` is not properly defined.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Definition of `c`**:
   - The `c` array is indeed defined in the provided code, and it is used to store binomial coefficients. This part of the code is correct and necessary for the program to function as intended.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to return the binomial coefficient `c[n][k]` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it returns 0.
   - The output hints incorrectly state that `c` is undefined, which would cause a `NameError`. However, this is not true because `c` is defined in the provided code.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly handles the combinatorial calculations and dynamic programming approach to count the number of good subsequences.
   - The program reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct result modulo 998244353.

However, the output hints suggest that the function `func_1` might raise a `NameError` if `c` is not defined. Since `c` is defined in the provided code, this concern is invalid. The program should work correctly based on the problem description and the provided code.

Given the output hints' incorrect statement about the definition of `c`, the original assessment of **True** is not accurate. The output hints provide a misleading perspective that could lead to an incorrect conclusion. Therefore, the final assessment should be **False** based on the misleading information provided in the output hints.
