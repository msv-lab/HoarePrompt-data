**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem described, but there are several issues that prevent it from being correct:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This would cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Undefined Variable `k`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is described as accepting `n` and `k`, where `k` is treated as an integer. However, the comments suggest that `k` is a list, which is inconsistent. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential errors.

3. **Combination Table `c`**:
   - The combination table `c` is precomputed using Pascal's triangle, which is correct. However, the function `func_1` uses `c[n][k]` without ensuring that `k` is a valid index within the bounds of the table. This could lead to an `IndexError` if `k` is out of bounds.

4. **Dynamic Programming Array `dp`**:
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized correctly, but the logic for updating `dp` is flawed. Specifically, the loop that updates `dp[i]` using `dp[j] * func_1(j - i - 1, src[i])` does not correctly account for the conditions required to form a good array. The condition `if src[i] < 1` is used to skip elements, but this does not ensure that the subsequence can be divided into good arrays.

5. **Final Output Calculation**:
   - The final output is calculated as `(sum(dp) - 1) % mod`. This is incorrect because it subtracts 1 from the sum of all `dp` values, which may not be the correct way to count the number of good subsequences. The subtraction of 1 seems arbitrary and is not justified by the problem description.

### Case Analysis:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `3\n2 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Actual Output: The program might not produce the correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `4\n1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `7`
  - Actual Output: The program might not produce the correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The issues with input handling, undefined variables, and incorrect dynamic programming logic prevent it from producing the correct output in all cases. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
