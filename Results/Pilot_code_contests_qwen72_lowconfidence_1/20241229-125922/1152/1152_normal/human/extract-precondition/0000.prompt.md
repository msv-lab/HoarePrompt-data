You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: The sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k is called a good array if a_1 = k - 1 and a_1 > 0. For example, the sequences [3, -1, 44, 0], [1, -99] are good arrays, and the sequences [3, 7, 8], [2, 5, 4, 1], [0] — are not.

A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 3, -3, -9, 4] are good, and the sequences [2, -3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 3, -3 -9, 4, 1] — are not.

For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.

Input

The first line contains the number n~(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n~(-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the sequence itself.

Output

In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.

Note

In the first test case, two good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3] and [a_2, a_3].

In the second test case, seven good subsequences — [a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4] and [a_3, a_4].
Function definition:
```
def func_1(n, k):
```
