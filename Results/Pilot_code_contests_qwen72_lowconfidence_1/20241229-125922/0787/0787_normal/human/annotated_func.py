#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5. a is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1. l and r are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n.

    n, m = line.split()

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the initial `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is `m-1`. For each query `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[i]` and `r[i]` are the start and end indices of the query, `length` is `r[i] - l[i] + 1`. If `length` is even and `length / 2` is less than or equal to `minimum`, the number 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed to the console. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input to process a series of queries on a list of integers. It expects the first input line to contain two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `m` is the number of queries. The second input line contains `n` integers, each being either -1 or 1. The function then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of integers `l` and `r` representing a query. For each query, the function calculates the length of the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If the length is even and half of this length is less than or equal to the minimum count of -1 or 1 in the entire list `a`, the function prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0. After processing all queries, the function terminates without returning any value. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated. The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases, such as incorrect number of inputs or out-of-range values.
