The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer (previously a string containing the first part of `line`), `r` is an integer (converted from a string containing the second part of `line`), `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 0**
