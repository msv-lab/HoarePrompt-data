The code snippet assigns the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus` to the variable `minimum`. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `line`, and `nr_minus` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input, `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`**.
