The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer and assigns this integer back to `r`. This changes the type of `r` from a string to an integer, while the value of `r` remains the same numerically.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the integer representation of the first part of `line`, `r` is an integer, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1**
