The line of code `line = raw_input()` updates the variable `line` to be the user's input as a string. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1. If `length` (which is `r - l + 1`) is even, `length` is `(r - l + 1) / 2`. If `length` is less than or equal to `minimum`, then `length` remains `(r - l + 1) / 2` and is less than or equal to `minimum`. Otherwise, `length` is greater than `minimum`. If `length` is odd, `length` remains `r - l + 1`.**
