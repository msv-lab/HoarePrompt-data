The code `l, r = line.split()` splits the string `line` into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns these parts to `l` and `r` respectively. This means that `l` and `r` are now strings representing the first and second parts of `line`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `m` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1
- `l` is an integer
- `r` is an integer
- `line` is the user's input as a string
- `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`
- `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code:
- `l` is now the first part of `line` (a string)
- `r` is now the second part of `line` (a string)

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the first part of `line` (a string), `r` is the second part of `line` (a string), `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1**
