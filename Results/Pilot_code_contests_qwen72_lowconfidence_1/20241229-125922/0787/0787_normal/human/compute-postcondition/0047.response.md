Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the initial `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is `m-1`. For each query `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[i]` and `r[i]` are the start and end indices of the query, `length` is `r[i] - l[i] + 1`. If `length` is even and `length / 2` is less than or equal to `minimum`, the number 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed to the console. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated.**
