The line `n, m = line.split()` splits the string `line` into two parts based on spaces and assigns these parts to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Since `line` is a string input by the user, and assuming the user inputs two values separated by a space, `n` and `m` will now hold these two string values.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are strings representing the first and second parts of the user input, respectively. `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1. `l` and `r` are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n. `line` is a string input by the user.**
