The code snippet `length = r - l + 1` calculates the length of a segment defined by the difference between `r` and `l`, plus one. This calculation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.

- `length` is now equal to `r - l + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `nr_minus`, `minimum`, `i`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the integer representation of the first part of `line`, `r` is an integer, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1, `length` is `r - l + 1`.**
