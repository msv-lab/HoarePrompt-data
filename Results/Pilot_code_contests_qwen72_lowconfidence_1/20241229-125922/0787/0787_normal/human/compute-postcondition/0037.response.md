The code snippet `l, r = line.split()` splits the string `line` into two parts based on spaces and assigns the first part to `l` and the second part to `r`.

- `line` is a string read from user input.
- After splitting, `l` and `r` are updated to the first and second parts of `line`, respectively.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the first part of the input string `line`, `r` is the second part of the input string `line`, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string.**
