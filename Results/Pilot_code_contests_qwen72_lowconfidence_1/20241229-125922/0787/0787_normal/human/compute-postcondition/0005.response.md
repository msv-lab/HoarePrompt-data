The code snippet `nr_minus = line.count('-')` counts the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the string `line` and assigns this count to the variable `nr_minus`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input.
- `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1.
- `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`.
- `line` is the user's input as a string.

After executing the code snippet:
- `nr_minus` is assigned the value of the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the string `line`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input, `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`.**
