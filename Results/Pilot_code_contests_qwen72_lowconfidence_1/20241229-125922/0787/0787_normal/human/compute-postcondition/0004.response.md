The `line` variable is assigned the value of the user's input as a string. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input, `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input, `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, `line` is the user's input as a string.**
