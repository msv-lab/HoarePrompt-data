Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the integer representation of the first part of `line`, `r` is an integer, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1, `length` is `(r - l + 1) / 2`. If `length` is less than or equal to `minimum`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
