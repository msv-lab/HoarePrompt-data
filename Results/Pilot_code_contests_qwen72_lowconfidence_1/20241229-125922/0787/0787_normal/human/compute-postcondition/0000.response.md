The line `line = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. The input read is a string.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5. `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1. `l` and `r` are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n. `line` is a string input by the user.**
