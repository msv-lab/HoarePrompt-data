The code snippet `length = r - l + 1` calculates the length of a range from `l` to `r` inclusive.

- `length` is calculated as `r - l + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `nr_minus`, `minimum`, `i`, and `line` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer (the first part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `r` is an integer (the second part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string, `length` is `r - l + 1`.**
