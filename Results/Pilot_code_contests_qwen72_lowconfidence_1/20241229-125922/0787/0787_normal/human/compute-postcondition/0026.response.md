The code snippet `l = int(l)` converts the variable `l`, which was initially the first part of `line` (a string), into an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the integer representation of the first part of `line`, `r` is the second part of `line` (a string), `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 1**
