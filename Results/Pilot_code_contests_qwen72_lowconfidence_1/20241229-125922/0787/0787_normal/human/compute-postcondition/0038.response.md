The code snippet `l = int(l)` converts the value of `l` from a string to an integer. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer (the first part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `r` is the second part of the input string `line`, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string.**
