The code snippet `length = length / 2` divides the current value of `length` by 2 and assigns the result back to `length`.

Given the initial state:
- `length` is calculated as `r - l + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `nr_minus`, `minimum`, `i`, and `line` remain unchanged.

After executing the code snippet:
- `length` is updated to `(r - l + 1) / 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer (the first part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `r` is an integer (the second part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string, `length` is `(r - l + 1) / 2`.**
