Functionality: ** The function reads from standard input to process a series of queries on a list of integers. It expects the first input line to contain two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `m` is the number of queries. The second input line contains `n` integers, each being either -1 or 1. The function then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of integers `l` and `r` representing a query. For each query, the function calculates the length of the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If the length is even and half of this length is less than or equal to the minimum count of -1 or 1 in the entire list `a`, the function prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0. After processing all queries, the function terminates without returning any value. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated. The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases, such as incorrect number of inputs or out-of-range values. **
