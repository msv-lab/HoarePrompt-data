The code snippet `print(0)` does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program. It only outputs the integer `0` to the console. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer (the first part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `r` is an integer (the second part of the input string `line` converted to an integer), `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string, `length` is `r - l + 1`.**
