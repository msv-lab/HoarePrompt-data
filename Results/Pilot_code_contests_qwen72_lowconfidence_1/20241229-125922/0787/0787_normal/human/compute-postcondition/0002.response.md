The value of `n` is converted from a string to an integer using the `int()` function. The values of `m`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input, `m` is a string representing the second part of the user input, `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n, `line` is a string input by the user.**
