Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 0, `length` is `(r - l + 1) / 2`, and `length` is greater than `minimum`.***
