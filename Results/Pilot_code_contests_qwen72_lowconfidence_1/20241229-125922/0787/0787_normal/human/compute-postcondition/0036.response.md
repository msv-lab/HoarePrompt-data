The code snippet reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `nr_minus`, `minimum`, or `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is the integer representation of the first part of `line`, `r` is an integer, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 2, `line` is the input string.**
