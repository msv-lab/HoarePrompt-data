The code snippet `l, r = line.split()` splits the string `line` into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns these parts to the variables `l` and `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input.
- `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1.
- `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`.
- `line` is the user's input as a string.
- `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`.
- `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`.
- `i` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `l` and `r` are now strings containing the first and second parts of `line`, respectively.
- The initial lists `l` and `r` (which were lists of integers) are no longer valid in this context, as they are now reassigned to the split parts of `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the first part of the user input, `m` is an integer representing the second part of the user input and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` is a string containing the first part of `line`, `r` is a string containing the second part of `line`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is 0**.
