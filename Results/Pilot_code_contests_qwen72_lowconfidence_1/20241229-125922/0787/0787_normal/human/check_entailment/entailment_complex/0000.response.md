Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the first line to get `n` and `m`, where `n` is the length of the array `a` and `m` is the number of queries.
   - The second line reads the array `a` consisting of `n` integers, each being either -1 or 1.
   - The next `m` lines read the queries, each containing a pair of integers `l` and `r`.

2. **Counting -1s:**
   - The program counts the number of `-1` in the array `a` using `line.count('-')`. This is stored in `nr_minus`.
   - The variable `minimum` is set to the minimum of `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`. This represents the maximum number of pairs of `-1` and `1` that can be formed from the array.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the length of the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - If the length of the subarray is even, it checks if half of this length is less than or equal to `minimum`.
     - If true, it prints `1` because it is possible to rearrange the subarray to make the sum zero.
     - If false, it prints `0` because it is not possible to rearrange the subarray to make the sum zero.
   - If the length of the subarray is odd, it prints `0` because an odd-length subarray cannot have a sum of zero with only -1 and 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query in the order they appear in the input.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling Queries:**
  - The program correctly determines whether a subarray can be rearranged to have a sum of zero by checking if the length of the subarray is even and if half of this length is within the available pairs of `-1` and `1`.
  - For odd-length subarrays, the program correctly prints `0` because it is impossible to achieve a sum of zero with an odd number of elements.

- **Input Assumptions:**
  - The program assumes valid input, which is consistent with the problem description. It does not need to handle invalid input cases such as incorrect number of inputs or out-of-range values.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `m` is 0 (no queries) by not processing any queries and not generating any output, which is correct according to the problem description.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
