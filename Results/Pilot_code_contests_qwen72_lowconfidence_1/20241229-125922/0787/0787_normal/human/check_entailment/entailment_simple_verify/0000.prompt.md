You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Eugeny has array a = a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers. Each integer ai equals to -1, or to 1. Also, he has m queries:

  * Query number i is given as a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n). 
  * The response to the query will be integer 1, if the elements of array a can be rearranged so as the sum ali + ali + 1 + ... + ari = 0, otherwise the response to the query will be integer 0. 



Help Eugeny, answer all his queries.

Input

The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (ai = -1, 1). Next m lines contain Eugene's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

Output

Print m integers — the responses to Eugene's queries in the order they occur in the input.

    line = raw_input()
    nr_minus = line.count('-')
    minimum = min(nr_minus, n - nr_minus)
    for i in xrange(m):
        line = raw_input()
        (l, r) = line.split()
        l = int(l)
        r = int(r)
        length = r - l + 1
        if length % 2 == 0:
            length = length / 2
            if length <= minimum:
                print(1)
            else:
                print(0)
        else:
            print(0)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray from `li` to `ri` has an even number of elements but the number of `-1` and `1` within this subarray cannot be balanced to sum to zero due to their distribution. For example, consider the input:

```
4 2
1 1 1 -1
1 4
2 4
```

For the query `1 4`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 1, -1]`. The length is 4, which is even, and half the length is 2. However, there are 3 `1`s and 1 `-1`, making it impossible to rearrange the subarray to sum to zero. The program incorrectly outputs `1` because it only checks if the half-length is less than or equal to the minimum of the counts of `-1` and `1` in the entire array, without considering the actual distribution within the queried subarray.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5. a is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1. l and r are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n.
def func():
    line = raw_input()
    n, m = line.split()
    n = int(n)
    m = int(m)
    line = raw_input()
    nr_minus = line.count('-')
    minimum = min(nr_minus, n - nr_minus)
    for i in xrange(m):
        line = raw_input()
        
        l, r = line.split()
        
        l = int(l)
        
        r = int(r)
        
        length = r - l + 1
        
        if length % 2 == 0:
            length = length / 2
            if length <= minimum:
                print(1)
            else:
                print(0)
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the initial `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is `m-1`. For each query `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[i]` and `r[i]` are the start and end indices of the query, `length` is `r[i] - l[i] + 1`. If `length` is even and `length / 2` is less than or equal to `minimum`, the number 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed to the console. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
