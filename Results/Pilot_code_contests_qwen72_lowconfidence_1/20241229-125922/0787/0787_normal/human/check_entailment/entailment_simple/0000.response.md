Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the first line to get the values of `n` and `m`.
   - It reads the second line to get the array `a` and counts the number of `-1` elements (`nr_minus`).
   - It calculates `minimum` as the minimum of `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, which represents the maximum number of pairs of `-1` and `1` that can be formed.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the values of `l` and `r`.
   - It calculates the length of the subarray from `l` to `r` inclusive.
   - If the length of the subarray is even, it checks if half of the length is less than or equal to `minimum`.
     - If true, it prints `1` because it is possible to rearrange the subarray to have a sum of `0`.
     - If false, it prints `0` because it is not possible to rearrange the subarray to have a sum of `0`.
   - If the length of the subarray is odd, it prints `0` because it is impossible to have a sum of `0` with an odd number of elements.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the order they are provided.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Even Length Subarray**: For a subarray to have a sum of `0`, it must have an equal number of `-1` and `1` elements. This is only possible if the length of the subarray is even. The program correctly checks this condition and ensures that the number of pairs (half the length) does not exceed the available pairs (`minimum`).
- **Odd Length Subarray**: An odd-length subarray cannot have a sum of `0` because there will always be one more `-1` or `1` element, making the sum non-zero. The program correctly handles this case by printing `0`.
- **Input Handling**: The program assumes valid input, which is consistent with the problem statement. It does not need to handle invalid inputs like empty lists or non-integer values.

Therefore, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified.
