You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Eugeny has array a = a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers. Each integer ai equals to -1, or to 1. Also, he has m queries:

  * Query number i is given as a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n). 
  * The response to the query will be integer 1, if the elements of array a can be rearranged so as the sum ali + ali + 1 + ... + ari = 0, otherwise the response to the query will be integer 0. 



Help Eugeny, answer all his queries.

Input

The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (ai = -1, 1). Next m lines contain Eugene's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

Output

Print m integers — the responses to Eugene's queries in the order they occur in the input.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5. a is a list of n integers where each ai is either -1 or 1. l and r are lists of m integers each, representing the queries, where for each i, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n.
def func():
    line = raw_input()
    n, m = line.split()
    n = int(n)
    m = int(m)
    line = raw_input()
    nr_minus = line.count('-')
    minimum = min(nr_minus, n - nr_minus)
    for i in xrange(m):
        line = raw_input()
        
        l, r = line.split()
        
        l = int(l)
        
        r = int(r)
        
        length = r - l + 1
        
        if length % 2 == 0:
            length = length / 2
            if length <= minimum:
                print(1)
            else:
                print(0)
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is either -1 or 1, `l` and `r` are lists of `m` integers each, representing the queries, where for each `i`, 1 ≤ `li` ≤ `ri` ≤ `n`, `line` is the user's input as a string, `nr_minus` is the number of occurrences of the character `'-'` in the initial `line`, `minimum` is the minimum value between `nr_minus` and `n - nr_minus`, `i` is `m-1`. For each query `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `l[i]` and `r[i]` are the start and end indices of the query, `length` is `r[i] - l[i] + 1`. If `length` is even and `length / 2` is less than or equal to `minimum`, the number 1 is printed to the console. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed to the console. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
