You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Eugeny has array a = a1, a2, ..., an, consisting of n integers. Each integer ai equals to -1, or to 1. Also, he has m queries:

  * Query number i is given as a pair of integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n). 
  * The response to the query will be integer 1, if the elements of array a can be rearranged so as the sum ali + ali + 1 + ... + ari = 0, otherwise the response to the query will be integer 0. 



Help Eugeny, answer all his queries.

Input

The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (ai = -1, 1). Next m lines contain Eugene's queries. The i-th line contains integers li, ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).

Output

Print m integers — the responses to Eugene's queries in the order they occur in the input.

        l = int(l)

        length = r - l + 1
        if length % 2 == 0:
            length = length / 2
            if length <= minimum:
                print(1)
            else:
                print(0)
        else:
            print(0)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray from `li` to `ri` contains an equal number of `1`s and `-1`s but the overall array does not have enough `-1`s or `1`s to balance the subarray to zero. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
1 1 -1 -1
1 4
```

The correct output should be `1` because the subarray from index 1 to 4 (`1 1 -1 -1`) can be rearranged to sum to zero. However, the program will output `0` because it only checks if the length of the subarray divided by 2 is less than or equal to the minimum count of `1`s or `-1`s in the entire array, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray can be rearranged to sum to zero. 

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads from standard input to process a series of queries on a list of integers. It expects the first input line to contain two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and `m` is the number of queries. The second input line contains `n` integers, each being either -1 or 1. The function then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of integers `l` and `r` representing a query. For each query, the function calculates the length of the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If the length is even and half of this length is less than or equal to the minimum count of -1 or 1 in the entire list `a`, the function prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0. After processing all queries, the function terminates without returning any value. If `m` is 0, no queries are processed, and no output is generated. The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases, such as incorrect number of inputs or out-of-range values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
