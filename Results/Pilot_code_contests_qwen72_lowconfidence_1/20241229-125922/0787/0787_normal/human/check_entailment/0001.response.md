Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray from `li` to `ri` contains an equal number of `1`s and `-1`s but the overall array does not have enough `-1`s or `1`s to balance the subarray to zero. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
1 1 -1 -1
1 4
```

The correct output should be `1` because the subarray from index 1 to 4 (`1 1 -1 -1`) can be rearranged to sum to zero. However, the program will output `0` because it only checks if the length of the subarray divided by 2 is less than or equal to the minimum count of `1`s or `-1`s in the entire array, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray can be rearranged to sum to zero. 

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
