Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to correctly process queries when the subarray length is odd. According to the problem description, a subarray can be rearranged to have a sum of 0 if and only if it contains an equal number of -1s and 1s. This is only possible if the subarray length is even. However, the code incorrectly prints 0 for all odd-length subarrays without considering whether the subarray could be rearranged to meet the condition.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 2
1 -1 1 -1
1 4
2 3
```
The expected output is:
```
1
0
```
However, the given code will output:
```
1
0
```
This is correct for the first query but incorrect for the second query. The subarray from index 2 to 3 is [-1, 1], which can be rearranged to have a sum of 0, so the correct output for the second query should be 1, not 0.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
