Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray from `li` to `ri` has an even number of elements but the number of `-1` and `1` within this subarray cannot be balanced to sum to zero due to their distribution. For example, consider the input:

```
4 2
1 1 1 -1
1 4
2 4
```

For the query `1 4`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 1, -1]`. The length is 4, which is even, and half the length is 2. However, there are 3 `1`s and 1 `-1`, making it impossible to rearrange the subarray to sum to zero. The program incorrectly outputs `1` because it only checks if the half-length is less than or equal to the minimum of the counts of `-1` and `1` in the entire array, without considering the actual distribution within the queried subarray.
