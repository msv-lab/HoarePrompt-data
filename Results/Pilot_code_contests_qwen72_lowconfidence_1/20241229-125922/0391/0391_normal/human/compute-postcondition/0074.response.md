Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem` remain unchanged. `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`, `y2` is updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state, and `err` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\). If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`, `y1out` is updated to the new value of `y1`, and `y2out` is updated to the new value of `y2`.***
