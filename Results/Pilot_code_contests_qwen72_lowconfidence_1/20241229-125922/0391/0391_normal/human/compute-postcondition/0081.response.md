The code `y2 -= rem / dt2` updates the value of `y2` by subtracting `rem / dt2` from its current value. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged.
   - `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1.
   - `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`.
   - `err` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\).
   - If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`.
   - `y1out` is updated to the new value of `y1`.
   - `y2out` is updated to the new value of `y2`.
   - `rem` is updated to `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.
   - If `rem == 0`, the function returns `y1` and `y2`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `y2` is further updated by subtracting `rem / dt2` from its current value.

3. **Final State**:
   - `y2` is now `y2 - (y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`.
   - Simplifying the expression for `y2`:
     \[
     y2 = y2 - \left( \frac{y2 \times dt2 - y1 \times dt1}{dt2} \right)
     \]
     \[
     y2 = y2 - \left( y2 - \frac{y1 \times dt1}{dt2} \right)
     \]
     \[
     y2 = y2 - y2 + \frac{y1 \times dt1}{dt2}
     \]
     \[
     y2 = \frac{y1 \times dt1}{dt2}
     \]

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged, `y1` is `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1, `y2` is \(\frac{y1 \times dt1}{dt2}\), `err` is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), if `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`, `y1out` is `y1 - d1`, `y2out` is \(\frac{y1 \times dt1}{dt2}\), `rem` is \(y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1\). If `rem == 0`, the function returns `y1` and `y2`.**
