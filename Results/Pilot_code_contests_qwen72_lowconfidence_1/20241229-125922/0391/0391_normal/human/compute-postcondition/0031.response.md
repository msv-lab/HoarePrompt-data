The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `y1` and `y2` using the `fractions.gcd` function and assigns the result to `g`.

### Impact of the Code:
- `g` is assigned the value of `gcd(y1, y2)`.

### Initial State:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\).
- `dt1 = t0 - t1`, `dt2 = t2 - t0`, `dt1 ≠ 0`, `dt2 ≠ 0`.
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\).
- Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged.
- Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\).
- `y1max` is not equal to 0.
- The current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`.
- `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`.
- `y1 = n * dt2`.
- `y2 = n * dt1`.

### Calculation:
- `g = gcd(y1, y2)`

### Output State:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\), `dt1 = t0 - t1`, `dt2 = t2 - t0`, `dt1 ≠ 0`, `dt2 ≠ 0`, `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`, if `calc1max < y1max` then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`, `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1, if `calc2max < y2max` then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\), otherwise the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged, additionally \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\), `y1max` is not equal to 0, the current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`, `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`, `y1 = n * dt2`, `y2 = n * dt1`, `g = gcd(y1, y2)`.**
