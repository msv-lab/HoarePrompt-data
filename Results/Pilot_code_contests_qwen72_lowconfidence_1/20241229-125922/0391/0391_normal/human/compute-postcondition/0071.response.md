Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin, err` remain unchanged. `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`. If `dt1` is true and `rem` is greater than or equal to `dt2`, `y2` is updated to `y1 * dt1 / dt2`, and the values of `y1` and `y2` are returned. Otherwise, `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`, and `rem` is updated to `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. If `rem` is 0, the program returns the updated values of `y1` and `y2`. If `dt2` is true and `rem` is less than 0, `y1` is further updated to `y1 - (dt1 - (rem + 1)) / dt1`, `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`, `rem` is updated to `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`, and if `rem` is 0, the program returns the updated values of `y1` and `y2`.***
