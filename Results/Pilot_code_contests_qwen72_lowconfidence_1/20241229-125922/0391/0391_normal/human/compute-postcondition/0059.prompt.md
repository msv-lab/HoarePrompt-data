You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: The given Python code calculates the error `err` using the formula:

\[ \text{err} = \frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0 \]

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State Variables**: 
   - `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged.
   - `y1` and `y2` are determined based on conditions involving `y1`, `y2`, `y2max`, `dt1`, `dt2`, and `rem`.
   - `rem` is calculated based on the values of `y1`, `y2`, `y2max`, `dt1`, and `dt2`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code does not modify `y1` or `y2` directly. It only uses their current values to compute `err`.
   - The calculation of `err` involves the values of `y1`, `y2`, `t1`, `t2`, and `t0`.

3. **Calculation of `err`**:
   - The formula for `err` is:
     \[
     \text{err} = \frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0
     \]
   - This formula will be used to compute the value of `err` based on the current values of `y1`, `y2`, `t1`, `t2`, and `t0`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `err`, which is now computed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged. If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`; otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. `rem` is not equal to 0. If `dt1` is true and `rem >= dt2`, `y2` is updated to `y2 - (rem / dt2)`, resulting in `y2` being `y2max - (y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2` if `y1 < y2`, or `y2max - 1 - ((y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2` otherwise. If `dt1` is false or `rem < dt2`, `y2` remains unchanged. If `dt2` is true and `rem < 0`, `y1` is updated to \( y1 - 1 + \frac{rem + 1}{dt1} \). `err` is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\)**.
if condition:
```
if (err < errMin):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
