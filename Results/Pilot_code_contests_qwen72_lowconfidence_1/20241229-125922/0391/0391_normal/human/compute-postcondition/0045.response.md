The code snippet `y1 -= d1` decrements the value of `y1` by the value of `d1`. The value of `d1` is determined based on the comparison between `y1` and `y2`:

- If `y1 < y2`, then `d1` is 1 and `d2` is 0.
- Otherwise, `d1` is 0 and `d2` is 1.

Given the initial state, `y1 = y1max` and `y2 = y2max`. The value of `d1` depends on whether `y1max < y2max`.

### Case Analysis:
1. **If `y1max < y2max`:**
   - `d1` is 1.
   - `y1 -= d1` results in `y1 = y1max - 1`.

2. **If `y1max >= y2max`:**
   - `d1` is 0.
   - `y1 -= d1` results in `y1 = y1max`.

### Output State:
- If `y1max < y2max`, then `y1` is updated to `y1max - 1`.
- If `y1max >= y2max`, then `y1` remains `y1max`.

All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\); `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`; `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`; `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`; if `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`; `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1; if `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\). Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged. Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\). `y1max` is not equal to 0. `dt1 > y2max` or `dt2 > y1max`. `y1 = y1max - d1` and `y2 = y2max`. If `y1 < y2`, then `d1` is 1 and `d2` is 0. Otherwise, `d1` is 0 and `d2` is 1. `y1out` is `y1max` and `y2out` is `y2max`. `errMin = (y1max * t1 + y2max * t2) / float(y1max + y2max) - t0`. `y1max` must be greater than 1 and `y2max` must be greater than 1.**
