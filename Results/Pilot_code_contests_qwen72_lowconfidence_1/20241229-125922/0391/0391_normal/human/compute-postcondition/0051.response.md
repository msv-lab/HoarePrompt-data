Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged; if `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`; otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. Additionally, `rem` is not equal to 0. The current value of `dt1` is not zero, and the current value of `rem` is greater than or equal to `dt2`.***
