The code snippet assigns new values to `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out`. Specifically, `errMin` is updated to the current value of `err`, `y1out` is updated to the current value of `y1`, and `y2out` is updated to the current value of `y2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged.
- `y1` is unchanged.
- `y2` is unchanged.
- `rem` is unchanged.
- `err` is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\).
- `errMin` is unchanged.
- `y1out` is unchanged.
- `y2out` is unchanged.

After executing the code:
- `errMin` is now \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\).
- `y1out` is now `y1`.
- `y2out` is now `y2`.

The other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem, y1, y2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem, y1, y2` remain unchanged, `err` is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), `errMin` is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), `y1out` is `y1`, `y2out` is `y2`**
