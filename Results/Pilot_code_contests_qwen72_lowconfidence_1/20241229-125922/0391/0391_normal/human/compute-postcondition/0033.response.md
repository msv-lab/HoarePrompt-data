To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet in the context of the initial state:

Initial State:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\)
- `dt1 = t0 - t1`
- `dt2 = t2 - t0`
- `dt1 ≠ 0`
- `dt2 ≠ 0`
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1
- If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\)
- Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged
- Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\)
- `y1max` is not equal to 0
- The current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`
- `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`
- `y1 = n * dt2`
- `y2 = n * dt1`
- `g = gcd(y1, y2)`
- `fr1 = y1 / g`
- `fr2 = y2 / g`

Code Snippet:
```python
n = min((y1max - y1) / fr1, (y2max - y2) / fr2)
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Expressions**:
   - `y1 = n * dt2`
   - `y2 = n * dt1`
   - `g = gcd(y1, y2)`
   - `fr1 = y1 / g`
   - `fr2 = y2 / g`

2. **New Calculation**:
   - The new value of `n` is calculated as:
     ```python
     n = min((y1max - y1) / fr1, (y2max - y2) / fr2)
     ```
   - This means `n` is updated to the minimum of two expressions:
     - `(y1max - y1) / fr1`
     - `(y2max - y2) / fr2`

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `n` is updated to the new value calculated from the above expression.
   - All other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y2, g, fr1, fr2`) remain unchanged.

Output State:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\), `dt1 = t0 - t1`, `dt2 = t2 - t0`, `dt1 ≠ 0`, `dt2 ≠ 0`, `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`, if `calc1max < y1max` then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`, `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1, if `calc2max < y2max` then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\), otherwise the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged, additionally \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\), `y1max` is not equal to 0, the current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`, `y1 = n * dt2`, `y2 = n * dt1`, `g = gcd(y1, y2)`, `fr1 = y1 / g`, `fr2 = y2 / g`, `n = min((y1max - y1) / fr1, (y2max - y2) / fr2)`**
