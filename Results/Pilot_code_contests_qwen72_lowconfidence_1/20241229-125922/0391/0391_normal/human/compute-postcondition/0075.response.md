To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that both `y1` and `y2` are greater than 1. According to the state provided:

- `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`.
- `y2` is updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state.

For the loop to execute one more time, both `y1` and `y2` must be greater than 1 after their respective updates. Since `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`, we need to ensure that `y1 - d1 > 1` for the loop to continue. Similarly, `y2` must be greater than 1 after its update.

Given that `y1` and `y2` are the only variables that change in the loop condition, no other states need to be adjusted. The other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem`) remain unchanged and do not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `y1 - d1 > 1` and `y2 > 1` after the update.

State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem` remain unchanged. `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1, `y2` is updated based on the conditions provided in the initial state and must be greater than 1. `err` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\). If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`, `y1out` is updated to the new value of `y1`, and `y2out` is updated to the new value of `y2`.**
