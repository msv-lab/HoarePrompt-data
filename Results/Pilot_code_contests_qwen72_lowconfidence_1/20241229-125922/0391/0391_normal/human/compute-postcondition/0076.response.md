Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem` remain unchanged, `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1, `y2` remains unchanged, `err` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), if `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`, `y1out` is updated to the new value of `y1`, and `y2out` is updated to the new value of `y2`.**
