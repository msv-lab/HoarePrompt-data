To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while y1 > 1 and y2 > 1:
```

This means the loop will execute if both `y1` and `y2` are greater than 1.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `y1 = y1max`
- `y2 = y2max`

For the loop to execute at least once, we need:
- `y1max > 1`
- `y2max > 1`

Let's verify the given state:
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1 (but we need it to be greater than 1).
- `y2max` is not explicitly stated to be greater than 1, but it must be a positive integer since `y1max * dt1 ≠ y2max * dt2`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to ensure both `y1max` and `y2max` are greater than 1.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
- `y1max` must be greater than 1.
- `y2max` must be greater than 1.

All other conditions remain unchanged.

State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\); `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`; `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`; `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`; if `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`; `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1; if `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\). Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged. Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\). `y1max` is not equal to 0. `dt1 > y2max` or `dt2 > y1max`. `y1 = y1max` and `y2 = y2max`. If `y1 < y2`, then `d1` is 1 and `d2` is 0. Otherwise, `d1` is 0 and `d2` is 1. `y1out` is `y1max` and `y2out` is `y2max`. `errMin = (y1max * t1 + y2max * t2) / float(y1max + y2max) - t0`. `y1max` must be greater than 1 and `y2max` must be greater than 1.**
