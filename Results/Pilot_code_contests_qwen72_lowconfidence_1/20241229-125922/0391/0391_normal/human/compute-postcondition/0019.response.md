Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max, y2max \leq 10^6\); `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`; `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`; `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`; if `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`; `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1; `calc2max = (y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2`. The current value of `calc2max` is less than `y2max`.***
