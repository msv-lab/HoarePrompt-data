The provided Python code snippet assigns the values of `y1` and `y2` to new variables `y1out` and `y2out`, respectively. This operation does not alter the values of `y1` and `y2`, nor does it affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `y1out` and `y2out` with their respective values.

Given the initial state:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\).
- `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`.
- `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`.
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\). Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged.
- Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\).
- `y1max` is not equal to 0.
- `dt1 > y2max` or `dt2 > y1max`.
- `y1 = y1max` and `y2 = y2max`.
- If `y1 < y2`, then `d1` is 1 and `d2` is 0. Otherwise, `d1` is 0 and `d2` is 1.

After executing the code snippet:
- `y1out` is assigned the value of `y1`.
- `y2out` is assigned the value of `y2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\); `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`; `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`; `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`; if `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`; `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1; if `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\). Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged. Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\). `y1max` is not equal to 0. `dt1 > y2max` or `dt2 > y1max`. `y1 = y1max` and `y2 = y2max`. If `y1 < y2`, then `d1` is 1 and `d2` is 0. Otherwise, `d1` is 0 and `d2` is 1. `y1out` is `y1max` and `y2out` is `y2max`.**
