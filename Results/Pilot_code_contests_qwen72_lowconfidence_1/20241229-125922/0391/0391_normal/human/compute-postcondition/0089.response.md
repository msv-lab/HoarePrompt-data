Output State: **The program returns `y1out` and `y2out`, which are the values of `y1` and `y2` when the minimum error (`errMin`) was achieved during the loop execution. The minimum error (`errMin`) is calculated as \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\) for the final values of `y1` and `y2` that minimized the error.**
