Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y2, rem, err` remain unchanged. If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), and `y1out` is set to `y1`, and `y2out` is set to `y2`. Otherwise, `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out` remain unchanged.***
