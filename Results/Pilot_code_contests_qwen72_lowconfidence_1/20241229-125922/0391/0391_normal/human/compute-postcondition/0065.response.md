The value of `rem` is updated to the result of the expression `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. The states of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged. The value of `y1` was previously updated to `y1 - d1` and the value of `y2` was updated to `y2 - d2`.

Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin, err` remain unchanged, `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`, `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`, `rem` is updated to `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`**
