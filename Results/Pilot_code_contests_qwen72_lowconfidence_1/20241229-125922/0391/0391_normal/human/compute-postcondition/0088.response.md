Output State: **`y1` is 1 or `y2` is 1, `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged from their initial values. `y1out` and `y2out` are the values of `y1` and `y2` when the minimum error (`errMin`) was achieved during the loop execution. `errMin` is the minimum error calculated during the loop execution, which is \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\) for the final values of `y1` and `y2` that minimized the error.**
