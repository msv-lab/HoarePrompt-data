The value of `y2` is decremented by `d2`. The conditions and updates for `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out` are not triggered by this code snippet, so they remain unchanged. All other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, rem, err`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, rem, err` remain unchanged, `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`, `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`, `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out` remain unchanged.**
