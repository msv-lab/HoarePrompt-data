The code calculates the value of `rem` based on the values of `y2`, `dt2`, `y1`, and `dt1`. Given the initial conditions, `y2` is either `y2max` or `y2max - 1` depending on whether `y1 < y2` or not.

- If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max`.
- Otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1`.

The value of `rem` is calculated as `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged; if `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`; otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.**
