Postcondition: ***t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0 are integers such that 1 ≤ t1 ≤ t0 ≤ t2 ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y1max, y2max ≤ 10^6; dt1 = t0 - t1; dt2 = t2 - t0; dt1 ≠ 0, and dt2 ≠ 0; calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1. If `calc1max` < `y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`. The current value of `y1max` is less than 1.***
