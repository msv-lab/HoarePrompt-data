To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet:

```python
fr1, fr2 = y1 / g, y2 / g
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\).
   - `dt1 = t0 - t1`
   - `dt2 = t2 - t0`
   - `dt1 ≠ 0`
   - `dt2 ≠ 0`
   - `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`
   - If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
   - `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\).
   - Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged.
   - Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\).
   - `y1max` is not equal to 0.
   - The current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`.
   - `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`
   - `y1 = n * dt2`
   - `y2 = n * dt1`
   - `g = gcd(y1, y2)`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet assigns the results of the expressions `y1 / g` and `y2 / g` to the variables `fr1` and `fr2`, respectively.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `fr1` is assigned the value of `y1 / g`.
   - `fr2` is assigned the value of `y2 / g`.

4. **Updated State:**
   - All other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, n, y1, y2, g`) remain unchanged.
   - The new variables `fr1` and `fr2` are introduced with the values `y1 / g` and `y2 / g`, respectively.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\), `dt1 = t0 - t1`, `dt2 = t2 - t0`, `dt1 ≠ 0`, `dt2 ≠ 0`, `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`, if `calc1max < y1max` then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`, `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1, if `calc2max < y2max` then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\), otherwise the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged, additionally \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\), `y1max` is not equal to 0, the current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`, `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`, `y1 = n * dt2`, `y2 = n * dt1`, `g = gcd(y1, y2)`, `fr1 = y1 / g`, `fr2 = y2 / g`.**
