The code updates the value of `y2` by subtracting `rem / dt2` from it. The value of `rem` was previously calculated as `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.

- `y2` is updated to `y2 - (y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`.
- Simplifying the expression, `y2` becomes `y2 - (y2 - y1 * dt1 / dt2)`, which further simplifies to `y2 - y2 + y1 * dt1 / dt2`, and finally to `y1 * dt1 / dt2`.

Since `rem` is 0, the program returns the updated values of `y1` and `y2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin, err` remain unchanged, `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1`, `y2` is updated to `y1 * dt1 / dt2`, and the values of `y1` and `y2` are returned.**
