The code snippet calculates the value of `calc2max` using the formula `(y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max, y2max \leq 10^6\).
- `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`.
- `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`.
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.

The calculation for `calc2max` is:
\[ \text{calc2max} = \frac{y1max \cdot dt1 + dt2 - 1}{dt2} \]

Let's break down the calculation:
- `y1max * dt1` is the product of `y1max` and `dt1`.
- Adding `dt2 - 1` to this product gives us `y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1`.
- Dividing this sum by `dt2` results in `calc2max`.

Therefore, the value of `calc2max` is:
\[ \text{calc2max} = \frac{y1max \cdot dt1 + dt2 - 1}{dt2} \]

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, plus the new value of `calc2max`.

Output State: **`t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0` are integers such that \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max, y2max \leq 10^6\); `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`; `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`; `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`; if `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`; `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1; `calc2max = (y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2`.**
