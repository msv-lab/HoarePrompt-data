Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes five integer parameters `t1`, `t2`, `y1max`, `y2max`, and `t0`, where `1 ≤ t1 ≤ t0 ≤ t2 ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ y1max, y2max ≤ 10^6`. The function returns a tuple of two integers representing the maximum possible values of `y1` and `y2` under certain conditions, or specific values based on the input parameters and internal calculations. Here are the key outcomes and edge cases:

1. **If both `t1` and `t2` are equal to `t0`**:
   - The function returns `(y1max, y2max)`.

2. **If `t1` equals `t0` but `t2` does not**:
   - The function returns `(y1max, 0)`.

3. **If `t2` equals `t0` but `t1` does not**:
   - The function returns `(0, y2max)`.

4. **If `t1` and `t2` are both not equal to `t0`**:
   - The function calculates `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`.
   - If `y2max * dt2 / dt1 < y1max`, `y1max` is updated to `y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
   - If the updated `y1max` is less than 1, the function returns `(0, y2max)`.
   - The function then calculates `calc2max = (y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2`.
   - If `calc2max < y2max`, `y2max` is updated to `calc2max`.
   - If `y1max * dt1 == y2max * dt2`, the function returns `(y1max, y2max)`.
   - If `y1max == 0`, the function returns `(0, y2max)`.
   - If `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`, the function performs a series of calculations to find the optimal values of `y1` and `y2` that minimize the error `err = (y1 * t1 + y2 * t2) / (y1 + y2) - t0`. It returns these values.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function enters a loop to iteratively adjust `y1` and `y2` to minimize the error `err`. The loop continues until `y1` or `y2` is reduced to 1. The function returns the values of `y1` and `y2` that resulted in the minimum error during the loop execution.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
- **Division by Zero**: The function assumes `dt1` and `dt2` are non-zero. If `dt1` or `dt2` were zero due to some unexpected input, it could lead to division by zero errors.
- **Floating Point Precision**: The function uses floating-point arithmetic for error calculation, which can introduce precision issues.
- **GCD Calculation**: The function uses `fractions.gcd`, which is deprecated in Python 3.5 and later. It should use `math.gcd` instead.
- **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input parameters to ensure they meet the specified constraints. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs are out of range. **

In summary, the function aims to find the optimal values of `y1` and `y2` that satisfy certain conditions and minimize the error relative to `t0`, with specific handling for edge cases where `t1`, `t2`, or both are equal to `t0`. **
