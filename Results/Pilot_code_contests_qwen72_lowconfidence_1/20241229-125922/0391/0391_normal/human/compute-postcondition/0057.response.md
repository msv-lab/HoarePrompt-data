Postcondition: ***`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged. If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`; otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. `rem` is not equal to 0. If `dt1` is true and `rem >= dt2`, `y2` is updated to `y2 - (rem / dt2)`, resulting in `y2` being `y2max - (y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2` if `y1 < y2`, or `y2max - 1 - ((y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2` otherwise. If `dt1` is false or `rem < dt2`, `y2` remains unchanged. If `dt2` is true and `rem < 0`, `y1` is updated to \( y1 - 1 + \frac{rem + 1}{dt1} \).***
