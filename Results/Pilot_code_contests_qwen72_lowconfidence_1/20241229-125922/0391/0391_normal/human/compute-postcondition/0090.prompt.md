You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0 are integers such that 1 ≤ t1 ≤ t0 ≤ t2 ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y1max, y2max ≤ 10^6.
```
def func_1(t1, t2, y1max, y2max, t0):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns (y1max, y2max), where y1max and y2max are integers such that 1 ≤ y1max, y2max ≤ 10^6.

Case_2: The program returns the integer value of y1max and 0. y1max is an integer such that 1 ≤ y1max ≤ 10^6.

Case_3: The program returns (0, y2max) where y2max is an integer such that 1 ≤ y2max ≤ 10^6

Case_4: The program returns 0 and `y2max`, where `y2max` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y2max ≤ 10^6.

Case_5: The program returns `y1max` and `y2max`. `y1max` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\), and `y2max` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y2max \leq 10^6\). If `calc1max < y1max`, `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\). Otherwise, the values of `y1max` and `y2max` remain unchanged. The current values of `y1max * dt1` and `y2max * dt2` are equal.

Case_6: The program returns 0, and the value of `y2max` which is either the original `y2max` if `calc2max >= y2max` or the updated value of `y2max` calculated as \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\) if `calc2max < y2max`.

Case_7: The program returns two values: (y1 + n * fr1, y2 + n * fr2), where `y1` is `n * dt2`, `y2` is `n * dt1`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `y1` and `y2`, `fr1` is `y1 / g`, `fr2` is `y2 / g`, and `n` is the minimum of ((y1max - y1) / fr1, (y2max - y2) / fr2).

Case_8: The program returns the values of `y1` and `y2`. If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. Otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. The current value of `rem` is 0.

Case_9: The program returns `y1` which is updated to `y1 - d1` and `y2` which is updated to `y2 - d2`.

Case_10: The program returns `y1` which is updated to `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1, and `y2` which is updated to `y2 - d2`.

Case_11: The program returns `y1out` and `y2out`, which are the values of `y1` and `y2` when the minimum error (`errMin`) was achieved during the loop execution. The minimum error (`errMin`) is calculated as \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\) for the final values of `y1` and `y2` that minimized the error.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
