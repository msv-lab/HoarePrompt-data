The code `y2 -= rem / dt2` impacts the value of `y2`. We know that `rem` is greater than or equal to `dt2` and `dt2` is not zero, which means `rem / dt2` will yield a valid numerical value. The value of `y2` will be reduced by this calculated value.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max` and `rem` is `y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.
- Otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1` and `rem` is `(y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.
- `rem` is not equal to 0.
- `dt1` is not zero.
- `rem` is greater than or equal to `dt2`.

The updated value of `y2` will be:
- If `y1 < y2`, then `y2` becomes `y2max - (y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`.
- Otherwise, `y2` becomes `y2max - 1 - ((y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`.

Thus, the output state is:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y1out, y2out, errMin` remain unchanged; if `y1 < y2`, then `y2` is `y2max - (y2max * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`; otherwise, `y2` is `y2max - 1 - ((y2max - 1) * dt2 - y1 * dt1) / dt2`. `rem` is not equal to 0. The current value of `dt1` is not zero, and the current value of `rem` is greater than or equal to `dt2`.**
