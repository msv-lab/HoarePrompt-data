To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y2, rem, err` remain unchanged.
- If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), and `y1out` is set to `y1`, and `y2out` is set to `y2`.
- Otherwise, `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out` remain unchanged.

### `while` Loop Condition:
```
while y1 > 1 and y2 > 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition checks if both `y1` and `y2` are greater than 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, both `y1` and `y2` must be greater than 1.

### State Adjustments:
- The values of `y1` and `y2` must be such that they are both greater than 1.
- All other variables (`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, rem, err, errMin, y1out, y2out`) remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, no changes are needed to the state if `y1` and `y2` are already greater than 1. Therefore, the state remains the same as provided.

State: **`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max, y1, y2, rem, err` remain unchanged. If `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), and `y1out` is set to `y1`, and `y2out` is set to `y2`. Otherwise, `errMin`, `y1out`, and `y2out` remain unchanged.**
