The value of `calc1max` is calculated using the formula `y2max * dt2 / dt1`. The values of `t1`, `t2`, `y1max`, `y2max`, and `t0` remain unchanged. The values of `dt1` and `dt2` are also unchanged, and they are used in the calculation.

Output State: **t1, t2, y1max, y2max, and t0 are integers such that 1 ≤ t1 ≤ t0 ≤ t2 ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y1max, y2max ≤ 10^6; dt1 = t0 - t1; dt2 = t2 - t0; dt1 ≠ 0, and dt2 ≠ 0; calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1**
