The code snippet calculates the value of `n` as the minimum of two expressions: `y1max / dt2` and `y2max / dt1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\).
- `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`.
- `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`.
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\).
- Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged.
- Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\).
- `y1max` is not equal to 0.
- The current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`.

The calculation of `n` is:
- `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`

Since the values of `y1max`, `dt2`, `y2max`, and `dt1` are given and do not change, `n` is determined by these values.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t1, t2, y1max, t0` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq t1 \leq t0 \leq t2 \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq y1max \leq 10^6\).
- `dt1 = t0 - t1` and `dt2 = t2 - t0`.
- `dt1 ≠ 0` and `dt2 ≠ 0`.
- `calc1max = y2max * dt2 / dt1`.
- If `calc1max < y1max`, then the current value of `calc1max` is less than the original `y1max`.
- `y1max` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If `calc2max < y2max`, then `y2max` is updated to \((y1max * dt1 + dt2 - 1) / dt2\).
- Otherwise, the values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, and calc2max` remain unchanged.
- Additionally, \(y1max * dt1 \neq y2max * dt2\).
- `y1max` is not equal to 0.
- The current values of `dt1` and `dt2` are such that `dt1 <= y2max` and `dt2 <= y1max`.
- `n = min(y1max / dt2, y2max / dt1)`.
