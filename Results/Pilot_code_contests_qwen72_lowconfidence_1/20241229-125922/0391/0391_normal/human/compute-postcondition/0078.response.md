The code updates the variable `rem` to the value of `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`. The values of `t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged. The variables `y1` and `y2` have already been updated in the initial state to `y1 - d1` and `y2 - d2` respectively, and these updates are reflected in the calculation of `rem`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t1, t2, y1max, t0, dt1, dt2, calc1max, calc2max` remain unchanged, `y1` is updated to `y1 - d1` and must be greater than 1, `y2` is updated to `y2 - d2`, `err` is updated to \(\frac{(y1 \times t1 + y2 \times t2)}{\text{float}(y1 + y2)} - t0\), if `err < errMin`, `errMin` is updated to the new value of `err`, `y1out` is updated to the new value of `y1`, `y2out` is updated to the new value of `y2`, `rem` is updated to `y2 * dt2 - y1 * dt1`.**
