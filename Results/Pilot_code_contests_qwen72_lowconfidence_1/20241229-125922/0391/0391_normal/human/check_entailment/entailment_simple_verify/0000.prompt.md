You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bob is about to take a hot bath. 

There are two taps to fill the bath: a hot water tap and a cold water tap. The cold water's temperature is t1, and the hot water's temperature is t2. The cold water tap can transmit any integer number of water units per second from 0 to x1, inclusive. Similarly, the hot water tap can transmit from 0 to x2 water units per second.

If y1 water units per second flow through the first tap and y2 water units per second flow through the second tap, then the resulting bath water temperature will be:

<image>

Bob wants to open both taps so that the bath water temperature was not less than t0. However, the temperature should be as close as possible to this value. If there are several optimal variants, Bob chooses the one that lets fill the bath in the quickest way possible.

Determine how much each tap should be opened so that Bob was pleased with the result in the end.

Input

You are given five integers t1, t2, x1, x2 and t0 (1 ≤ t1 ≤ t0 ≤ t2 ≤ 106, 1 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 106).

Output

Print two space-separated integers y1 and y2 (0 ≤ y1 ≤ x1, 0 ≤ y2 ≤ x2).

Examples

Input

143 456 110 117 273


Output

76 54

Note

In the second sample the hot water tap shouldn't be opened, but the cold water tap should be opened at full capacity in order to fill the bath in the quickest way possible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: After reviewing the provided code, it appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the optimal flow rates for the cold and hot water taps to achieve a temperature as close as possible to the desired temperature `t0`, while ensuring that the temperature is not less than `t0`. The code considers various scenarios, such as when the desired temperature matches either the cold or hot water temperature, and adjusts the flow rates accordingly to minimize the difference from `t0` and maximize the flow rate. Given the complexity of the problem and the thoroughness of the code, it seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
