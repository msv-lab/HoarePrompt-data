Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in the handling of the calculation of `calc1max` and `calc2max`. Specifically, the division operations used in these calculations can result in floating-point numbers, which might not accurately represent the intended integer values for `y1max` and `y2max`. This can lead to incorrect results when the program is expected to output integer values for `y1` and `y2`.

For example, consider the input:
```
10 70 100 100 25
```
The program outputs:
```
99 33
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
98 34
```
This discrepancy arises because the program does not handle the rounding of floating-point results correctly, leading to a slight deviation from the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is considered incorrect.
