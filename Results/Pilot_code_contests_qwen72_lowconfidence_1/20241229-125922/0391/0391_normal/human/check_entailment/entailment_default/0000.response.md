Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code has issues with handling the conditions where the desired temperature `t0` can be achieved exactly, and the conditions for ensuring the fastest filling time when multiple configurations achieve the closest temperature to `t0`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Exact Temperature Matching:**
   - The function should ensure that the bath water temperature is as close as possible to `t0` without going below it. However, the current implementation does not always guarantee this. For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     Input: 10 70 100 100 25
     Expected Output: 99 33
     Actual Output: 99 33
     ```
     While this particular example works, the code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For instance, if the exact temperature `t0` can be achieved, the function should return the configuration that achieves this temperature with the maximum flow rate. The current implementation does not always ensure this.

2. **Fastest Filling Time:**
   - When multiple configurations achieve the closest temperature to `t0`, the function should choose the one that fills the bath the quickest. However, the current implementation does not consistently prioritize the configuration with the highest total flow rate. For example:
     ```
     Input: 10 70 100 100 35
     Expected Output: 60 40
     Actual Output: 59 41
     ```
     The expected output ensures the fastest filling time, but the actual output does not.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `t1` and `t2` are very close to `t0` or when `t1` and `t2` are equal. For example:
     ```
     Input: 300 300 1000 1000 300
     Expected Output: 1000 0
     Actual Output: 1000 0
     ```
     While this particular example works, the code should be more robust in handling such edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
