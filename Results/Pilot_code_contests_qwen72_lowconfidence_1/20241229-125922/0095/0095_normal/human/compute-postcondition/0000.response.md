The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `curr`. Since `curr` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` will be the number of elements in this list. The initial state of `curr` being a list of non-negative integers remains unchanged.

Output State: **`curr` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is the number of elements in `curr`**
