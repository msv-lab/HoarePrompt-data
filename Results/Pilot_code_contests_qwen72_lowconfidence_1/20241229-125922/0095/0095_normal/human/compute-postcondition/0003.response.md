Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers `curr` and returns `True` if every element in `curr` (except the first one) is strictly less than its preceding element. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function assumes that `curr` is a list and does not handle cases where `curr` is not a list or contains non-integer values. If `curr` is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare. **

Explanation:
- The function checks if the list `curr` is strictly decreasing from the first element to the last.
- If `curr` is empty or has only one element, the condition is trivially satisfied, and the function returns `True`.
- If `curr` contains two or more elements, the function returns `True` only if each element (starting from the second) is strictly less than the element immediately before it.
- The function does not validate the type of `curr` or the elements within `curr`, which could lead to errors if `curr` is not a list of integers.
