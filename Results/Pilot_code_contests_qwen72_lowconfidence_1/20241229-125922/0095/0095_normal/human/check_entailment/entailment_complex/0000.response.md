Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, there are issues with how the code determines whether an array can be transformed into a sharpened array. Here are a few cases where the code fails:

1. **Handling of Non-Strictly Increasing/Decreasing Arrays:**
   - The code uses `func_1` and `func_2` to check if the array is already strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. However, these functions do not account for the possibility of transforming the array into a sharpened form by decreasing elements. For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 1, 0]`. This array is not strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, but it can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing the second element to `0`, resulting in `[0, 0, 1, 0]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Peak Element:**
   - The code attempts to find a peak element (`ind`) where the array transitions from increasing to decreasing. However, the logic used to find this peak element is flawed. For instance, the code increments `pr` by 1 in each iteration, which is not a valid way to determine the peak element. Consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. The code will incorrectly set `ind` to 2 (index of the second `2`), but the array can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing the second `2` to `1`.

3. **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
   - After finding the peak element, the code attempts to transform the array by decreasing elements. However, the logic used to ensure the array becomes strictly decreasing after the peak is not robust. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. The code will fail to correctly transform this array into a sharpened form.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. The code will incorrectly determine that it cannot be transformed into a sharpened array, even though it can be transformed by decreasing elements to form a valid sharpened array.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
