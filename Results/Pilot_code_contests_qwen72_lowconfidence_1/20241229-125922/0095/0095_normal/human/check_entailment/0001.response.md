Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which check if a list is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, these functions do not address the main requirement of the problem, which is to determine if it's possible to make the given array sharpened by performing the allowed operations. The program does not include any logic to check if the array can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing elements. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the problem's requirements. 

For example, consider the input `[100, 11, 15, 9, 7, 8]`. The program does not provide a way to determine if this array can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing elements. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` would simply return `False` for this input, but the correct answer should be `Yes` because the array can be transformed into a sharpened array `[3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4]` by decreasing the first element 97 times and the last element 4 times.
