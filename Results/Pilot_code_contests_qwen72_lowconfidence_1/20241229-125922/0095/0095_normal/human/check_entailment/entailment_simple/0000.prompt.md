You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You're given an array a_1, …, a_n of n non-negative integers.

Let's call it sharpened if and only if there exists an integer 1 ≤ k ≤ n such that a_1 < a_2 < … < a_k and a_k > a_{k+1} > … > a_n. In particular, any strictly increasing or strictly decreasing array is sharpened. For example:

  * The arrays [4], [0, 1], [12, 10, 8] and [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] are sharpened; 
  * The arrays [2, 8, 2, 8, 6, 5], [0, 1, 1, 0] and [2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 8] are not sharpened. 



You can do the following operation as many times as you want: choose any strictly positive element of the array, and decrease it by one. Formally, you can choose any i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that a_i>0 and assign a_i := a_i - 1.

Tell if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using some number (possibly zero) of these operations.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 15\ 000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5).

The second line of each test case contains a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if it's possible to make the given array sharpened using the described operations, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note

In the first and the second test case of the first test, the given array is already sharpened.

In the third test case of the first test, we can transform the array into [3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4] (decrease the first element 97 times and decrease the last element 4 times). It is sharpened because 3 < 11 < 15 and 15 > 9 > 7 > 4.

In the fourth test case of the first test, it's impossible to make the given array sharpened.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if func_1(l) or func_2(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue
    ind = -1
    mini = 19 ** 10
    maxi = 0
    pr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        maxi = max(maxi, l[i])
        if l[i] < pr:
            ind = i
            break
        pr += 1
    f = 1
    if ind == -1:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    mini = l[ind - 1]
    for i in range(ind, n):
        l[i] = min(l[i], mini - 1)
        mini = min(mini, l[i])
        if l[i] < 0 or mini < 0:
            f = 0
    print('Yes' if f else 'No')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if every element in the list `curr` (except the first one) is greater than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if every element in `curr` (except the first one) is less than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns False. Here, `n` is the number of elements in `curr`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
