Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of Variables**:
   - In the main loop, the variable `pr` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, which is not used correctly. The intention seems to be to track the previous value, but this is done incorrectly. Instead, `pr` should be initialized to the first element of the list and updated accordingly.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Peak**:
   - The logic for finding the peak index (`ind`) is flawed. The condition `if l[i] < pr:` is used to find the first index where the sequence starts decreasing, but `pr` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration, which is incorrect. Instead, `pr` should be set to the current element in the list.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Decreasing Sequence**:
   - After finding the peak index, the program attempts to ensure that the sequence is strictly decreasing from the peak to the end. However, the logic for updating the elements in the list is incorrect. The line `l[i] = min(l[i], mini - 1)` can lead to values becoming negative, which is not allowed in the problem description.

4. **Incorrect Function Calls**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are called at the beginning of the main loop, but they are not defined with the correct parameter names. The function definitions use `l` instead of `curr`, which will cause a NameError.

5. **Redundant Logic**:
   - The program has redundant checks and logic that can be simplified. For example, the check `if ind == -1:` is unnecessary because the program already handles the case where the array is strictly increasing or decreasing.

### Corrected Version of the Program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    def is_increasing_or_decreasing(arr):
        return all(arr[i] > arr[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(arr))) or all(arr[i] < arr[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(arr)))
    
    if is_increasing_or_decreasing(l):
        print('Yes')
        continue
    
    ind = -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if l[i] < l[i - 1]:
            ind = i - 1
            break
    
    if ind == -1:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    
    for i in range(ind + 1, n):
        if l[i] >= l[i - 1]:
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('Yes')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `is_increasing_or_decreasing` checks if the array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. This simplifies the initial check.

2. **Finding the Peak**:
   - The program finds the peak index `ind` where the sequence starts decreasing. If no such index is found, the array is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, and the program prints 'Yes'.

3. **Checking the Decreasing Sequence**:
   - After finding the peak, the program checks if the sequence from the peak to the end is strictly decreasing. If any element is not strictly decreasing, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

This corrected version ensures that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
