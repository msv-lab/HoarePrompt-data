Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which check if a list is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, these functions do not address the main requirement of the problem, which is to determine if it's possible to make the given array sharpened by performing the allowed operations. The program does not include any logic to check if the array can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing elements. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the problem's requirements.

The output hints confirm that `func_2` checks if a list is strictly decreasing, but they do not address the core requirement of transforming the array into a sharpened form. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the array sharpened by decreasing elements, and the provided functions do not perform this task. Hence, the program is incorrect.
