Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` only check if the current array is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, respectively. However, the problem requires determining if it is possible to make the array "sharpened" by performing the specified operations (decreasing any strictly positive element by one). The program does not handle this requirement and only checks the current state of the array, which is insufficient to solve the problem correctly.

For example, consider the array `[100, 11, 15, 9, 7, 8]`. According to the problem, this array can be transformed into a sharpened array by decreasing the first element 97 times and the last element 4 times, resulting in `[3, 11, 15, 9, 7, 4]`, which is sharpened. However, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` would incorrectly determine that the original array is not sharpened without considering the possibility of transforming it.

The output hints confirm that `func_2` only checks if the array is strictly decreasing, which aligns with the original assessment that the program does not address the transformation requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
