The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It returns `True` if every element in the list (except the first one) is strictly greater than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element, returning `True` in both scenarios. However, the function does not handle non-integer or negative values, and it assumes that the input list contains only non-negative integers.
