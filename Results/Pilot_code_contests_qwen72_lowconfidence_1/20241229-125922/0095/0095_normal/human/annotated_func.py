#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a list of non-negative integers.
def func_1(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] > l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if every element in the list `curr` (except the first one) is greater than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `curr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It returns `True` if every element in the list (except the first one) is strictly greater than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element, returning `True` in both scenarios. However, the function does not handle non-integer or negative values, and it assumes that the input list contains only non-negative integers.

def func_2(curr):
    n = len(curr)
    return all(l[i] < l[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
    #The program returns True if every element in `curr` (except the first one) is less than its preceding element; otherwise, it returns False. Here, `n` is the number of elements in `curr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers `curr` and returns `True` if every element in `curr` (except the first one) is strictly less than its preceding element. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function assumes that `curr` is a list and does not handle cases where `curr` is not a list or contains non-integer values. If `curr` is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare.
