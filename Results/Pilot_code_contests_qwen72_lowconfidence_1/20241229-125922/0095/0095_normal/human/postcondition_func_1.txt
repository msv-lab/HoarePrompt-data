The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers `curr` and returns `True` if every element in `curr` (except the first one) is strictly less than its preceding element. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function assumes that `curr` is a list and does not handle cases where `curr` is not a list or contains non-integer values. If `curr` is empty or contains only one element, the function returns `True` since there are no elements to compare.
