Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where -1000 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 1000, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the subarray to consider (0 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < len(`a`)), `k` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of swaps allowed (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10), `out` is a sorted list in descending order of the elements from `a` before index `l` and after index `r` and must have at least one element, `inside` is a sorted list of the elements from `a` between indices `l` and `r-1` and must have at least one element, `cur` is the sum of the elements from `a[l]` to `a[r-1]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `out[i]` is greater than the current value of `inside[i]`***
