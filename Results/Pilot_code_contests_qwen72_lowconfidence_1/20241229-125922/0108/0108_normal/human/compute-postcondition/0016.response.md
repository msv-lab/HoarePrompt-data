Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where -1000 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 1000, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the subarray to consider (0 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < len(`a`)), `k` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of swaps allowed (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10), `out` is a sorted list in descending order of the elements from `a` before index `l` and after index `r` and must have at least 2 elements, `inside` is a sorted list of the elements from `a` between indices `l` and `r-1` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If `out[2]` > `inside[2]`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (out[2] - inside[2])`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
