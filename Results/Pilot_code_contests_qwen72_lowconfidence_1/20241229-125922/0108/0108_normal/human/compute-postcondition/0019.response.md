The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `l`, `r`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies -1000 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000. `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the subarray to consider, with 0 ≤ l ≤ r < len(a). `k` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of swaps allowed, with 1 ≤ k ≤ 10.

The function returns the value of `cur`, which is updated by adding the sum of differences (`out[j] - inside[j]`) for all `j` in the range of `i` where `out[j] > inside[j]`. Here, `i` is the minimum of `k`, the length of `out`, and the length of `inside`. If no such `j` exists or the loop does not execute, `cur` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two indices `l` and `r`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It returns the value of `cur`, which is updated by adding the sum of differences (`out[j] - inside[j]`) for all `j` in the range of `i` where `out[j] > inside[j]`.
