Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the length of the strip `n`, the direction of jumps `field`, and the lengths of jumps `power`. The annotated code confirms that these inputs are correctly read and processed.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the program assumes valid input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - The grasshopper starts at position `0` and moves according to the direction and length specified in the `field` and `power` arrays.
   - The position update formula `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` correctly calculates the new position based on the direction. This formula ensures that the grasshopper moves to the right if the direction is `>` and to the left if the direction is `<`.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop continues as long as the grasshopper is within the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and the current cell has not been visited (`power[pos] != 0`).
   - If the grasshopper moves outside the strip (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper visits a cell that has already been visited (indicated by `power[pos] == 0`), the program prints "INFINITE".

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotated code confirms the state of the program at different points, ensuring that the variables are in the expected state:
     - Before the loop: `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting of `<` and `>`, `power` is a list of integers.
     - After the loop: `n` remains a positive integer, `field` remains a string of length `n` consisting of `<` and `>`, `power` has been modified to set accessed elements to `0`, and `pos` is either out of bounds or at a position where `power[pos]` is `0`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the grasshopper starting at the first cell and moving out of bounds, or getting stuck in an infinite loop by revisiting cells.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all relevant cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
