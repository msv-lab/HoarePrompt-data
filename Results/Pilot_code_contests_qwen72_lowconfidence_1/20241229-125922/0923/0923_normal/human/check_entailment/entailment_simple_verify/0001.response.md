Final: **True**

Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values: `n` (length of the strip), `field` (directions), and `power` (jump lengths).
   - The annotated code confirms that `n` is an integer within the specified range, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", and `power` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Initial Position**:
   - The grasshopper starts at position `pos = 0`.

3. **Jump Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps.
   - The loop condition `0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0` ensures that the grasshopper continues jumping as long as it is within the bounds of the strip and the jump length at the current position is non-zero.
   - The direction of the jump is correctly determined by the character in `field[pos]`. If it is '>', the grasshopper jumps to the right; if it is '<', the grasshopper jumps to the left.
   - The new position is calculated as `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly handles both directions.
   - After each jump, the jump length at the current position is set to zero to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same jump length.

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip (i.e., `pos` is out of bounds), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper gets stuck in a loop within the strip (i.e., `pos` remains within bounds and `power[pos]` becomes zero), the program prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip on the first move.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper gets stuck in an infinite loop within the strip.

6. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program at different points, ensuring that the variables are in the expected state and that the logic is correctly implemented.

Given the above points and the confirmation from the annotations, the original assessment of the program being correct is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
