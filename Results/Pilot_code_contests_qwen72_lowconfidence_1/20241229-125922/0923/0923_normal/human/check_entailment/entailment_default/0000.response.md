Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly in all potential cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. Using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a `NameError`. This means the program will fail to run correctly in Python 3 environments.

2. **Handling of Infinite Loops**: The program sets `power[pos]` to 0 to mark visited positions, which is a good approach to avoid infinite loops. However, the termination condition `while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0` might not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, if the grasshopper enters a loop where it keeps revisiting the same cells, the program will correctly identify it as "INFINITE". However, if the grasshopper jumps out of bounds, the program will correctly identify it as "FINITE".

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the grasshopper starts at the first cell and immediately jumps out of bounds. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   1
   >
   2
   ```
   The grasshopper should jump out of bounds immediately, but the program will not handle this correctly because the initial position is `pos = 0`, and the loop condition will allow it to proceed.

4. **Termination Condition**: The termination condition `while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0` ensures that the loop stops if the grasshopper jumps out of bounds or revisits a cell. However, it does not explicitly check if the grasshopper jumps out of bounds after setting `power[pos]` to 0, which could lead to incorrect results.

To ensure correctness, the program should be modified to handle these edge cases and use the appropriate input functions for Python 3. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    visited = [False] * n
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        if visited[pos]:
            print("INFINITE")
            return
        visited[pos] = True
        pos += (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
    print("FINITE")

# Example usage
func()
```

This version of the program uses `input()` for Python 3, handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of bounds immediately, and uses a `visited` list to track visited cells, ensuring that the program correctly identifies infinite loops.
