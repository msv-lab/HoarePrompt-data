Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle the problem description correctly. It reads the input, processes the grasshopper's movements according to the rules specified, and determines whether the grasshopper will jump out of the strip or get stuck in an infinite loop.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the length of the strip `n`, the direction of jumps `field`, and the lengths of jumps `power`.
2. **Movement Logic**: The grasshopper starts at position `0` and moves according to the direction and length specified in the `field` and `power` arrays. The position is updated using the formula `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly calculates the new position based on the direction.
3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper moves outside the strip (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper visits a cell that has already been visited (indicated by `power[pos] == 0`), the program prints "INFINITE".

The program correctly handles both finite and infinite paths, and there are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause it to fail. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
