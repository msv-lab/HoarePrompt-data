Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the cases described in the problem statement correctly. Here's a breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values: `n` (length of the strip), `field` (directions), and `power` (jump lengths).

2. **Initial Position**: The grasshopper starts at position `pos = 0`.

3. **Jump Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps.
   - It checks if the current position `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and if the jump length at the current position is non-zero (`power[pos] != 0`).
   - The direction of the jump is determined by the character in `field[pos]`. If it is '>', the grasshopper jumps to the right; if it is '<', the grasshopper jumps to the left.
   - The new position is calculated as `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly handles both directions.
   - After each jump, the jump length at the current position is set to zero to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same jump length.

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip (i.e., `pos` is out of bounds), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper gets stuck in a loop within the strip (i.e., `pos` remains within bounds and `power[pos]` becomes zero), the program prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip on the first move.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper gets stuck in an infinite loop within the strip.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
