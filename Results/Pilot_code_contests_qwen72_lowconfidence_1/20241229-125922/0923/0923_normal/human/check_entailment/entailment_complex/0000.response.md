Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` representing the length of the strip.
   - It reads a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">" indicating the direction of the jump.
   - It reads a list `power` of `n` integers where each integer represents the length of the jump from the corresponding cell.

2. **Simulation of Jumps**:
   - The program initializes the position `pos` to 0, starting from the first cell.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `pos` is within the bounds of the strip and the current cell's jump length (`power[pos]`) is not zero.
   - Inside the loop, the program updates the position `pos` based on the direction and the length of the jump:
     - If the direction is ">", it moves `pos` to the right by `power[pos]`.
     - If the direction is "<", it moves `pos` to the left by `power[pos]`.
   - After updating the position, it sets `power[pos]` to 0 to mark the cell as visited.

3. **Output**:
   - After exiting the loop, the program checks the final position `pos`:
     - If `pos` is out of bounds (either less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), it prints "FINITE".
     - If `pos` is still within bounds, it prints "INFINITE".

The program correctly handles all cases described in the problem statement:
- **Finite Path**: If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip, the program will detect this and print "FINITE".
- **Infinite Path**: If the grasshopper keeps jumping within the strip without ever leaving, the program will detect this and print "INFINITE".

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
