Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the following points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values: `n` (length of the strip), `field` (directions), and `power` (jump lengths). The use of `input()` and `raw_input()` (for Python 2) ensures that the input is read as expected.

2. **Initial Position**: The grasshopper starts at position `pos = 0`, which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Jump Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps.
   - It checks if the current position `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and if the jump length at the current position is non-zero (`power[pos] != 0`).
   - The direction of the jump is determined by the character in `field[pos]`. If it is '>', the grasshopper jumps to the right; if it is '<', the grasshopper jumps to the left.
   - The new position is calculated as `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly handles both directions.
   - After each jump, the jump length at the current position is set to zero to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same jump length.

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip (i.e., `pos` is out of bounds), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper gets stuck in a loop within the strip (i.e., `pos` remains within bounds and `power[pos]` becomes zero), the program prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip on the first move.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper gets stuck in an infinite loop within the strip.

6. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function reads an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list `power` of `n` integers.
   - The position `pos` updates by moving forward or backward by the value in `power[pos]`, and the corresponding `power[pos]` is set to 0.
   - The function prints "INFINITE" if `pos` ends within the bounds of `field` and "FINITE" otherwise.
   - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, and the output hints support this correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct is accurate.
