Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the program is correct, and after reviewing the problem description, the provided program, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the length of the strip `n`, the direction of jumps `field`, and the lengths of jumps `power`. This matches the problem description and the output hints.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - The grasshopper starts at position `0` and moves according to the direction and length specified in the `field` and `power` arrays.
   - The position update formula `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` correctly calculates the new position based on the direction. If the direction is ">", it moves right; if "<", it moves left.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the grasshopper moves outside the strip (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`). If so, it prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper visits a cell that has already been visited (indicated by `power[pos] == 0`), it prints "INFINITE".

4. **Output Hints**:
   - The output hints confirm that the function reads the inputs correctly, simulates the movement as described, and prints the appropriate result based on the termination conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the grasshopper jumping out of bounds or getting stuck in a loop, which are consistent with the problem description and the output hints.

Given that the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
