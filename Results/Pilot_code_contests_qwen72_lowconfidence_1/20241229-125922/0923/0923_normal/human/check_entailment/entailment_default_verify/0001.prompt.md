You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Artem found a grasshopper. He brought it to his house and constructed a jumping area for him.

The area looks like a strip of cells 1 × n. Each cell contains the direction for the next jump and the length of that jump. Grasshopper starts in the first cell and follows the instructions written on the cells. Grasshopper stops immediately if it jumps out of the strip. Now Artem wants to find out if this will ever happen.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — length of the strip. 

Next line contains a string of length n which consists of characters "<" and ">" only, that provide the direction of the jump from the corresponding cell. Next line contains n integers di (1 ≤ di ≤ 109) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell.

Output

Print "INFINITE" (without quotes) if grasshopper will continue his jumps forever. Otherwise print "FINITE" (without quotes).

Examples

Input

2
&gt;&lt;
1 2


Output

FINITE


Input

3
&gt;&gt;&lt;
2 1 1


Output

INFINITE

Note

In the first sample grasshopper starts from the first cell and jumps to the right on the next cell. When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip.

Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    field = raw_input()
    power = map(int, raw_input().split())
    pos = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:
        (power[pos], pos) = (0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos])
    print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the cases described in the problem statement correctly. Here's a breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values: `n` (length of the strip), `field` (directions), and `power` (jump lengths).

2. **Initial Position**: The grasshopper starts at position `pos = 0`.

3. **Jump Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to simulate the grasshopper's jumps.
   - It checks if the current position `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and if the jump length at the current position is non-zero (`power[pos] != 0`).
   - The direction of the jump is determined by the character in `field[pos]`. If it is '>', the grasshopper jumps to the right; if it is '<', the grasshopper jumps to the left.
   - The new position is calculated as `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly handles both directions.
   - After each jump, the jump length at the current position is set to zero to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same jump length.

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip (i.e., `pos` is out of bounds), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper gets stuck in a loop within the strip (i.e., `pos` remains within bounds and `power[pos]` becomes zero), the program prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip on the first move.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper gets stuck in an infinite loop within the strip.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list `power` of `n` integers. It then simulates a process where a position `pos` moves through the `field` based on the direction ("<" or ">") and the value in `power`. The position `pos` updates by moving forward or backward by the value in `power[pos]`, and the corresponding `power[pos]` is set to 0. This continues until `pos` is out of bounds or encounters a `power[pos]` that is already 0. The function prints "INFINITE" if `pos` ends within the bounds of `field` and "FINITE" otherwise. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
