Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description and the expected behavior of the program. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the length of the strip `n`, the direction of jumps `field`, and the lengths of jumps `power`.
   - The annotations confirm that `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, and `power` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - The grasshopper starts at position `0` and moves according to the direction and length specified in the `field` and `power` arrays.
   - The position is updated using the formula `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly calculates the new position based on the direction.
   - The annotations confirm that the position `pos` is updated correctly and that the `power` values are set to 0 when the position is visited.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper moves outside the strip (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper visits a cell that has already been visited (indicated by `power[pos] == 0`), the program prints "INFINITE".
   - The annotations confirm that after the loop, `pos` is either out of bounds or at a position where `power[pos]` is 0, which aligns with the termination conditions described in the problem.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles both finite and infinite paths.
   - The annotations do not reveal any logical errors or edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
