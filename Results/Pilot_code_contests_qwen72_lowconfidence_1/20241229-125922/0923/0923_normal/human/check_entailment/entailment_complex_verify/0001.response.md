Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The annotated version of the code confirms the correctness of the program by providing detailed insights into the state of the program at various points. Here’s a systematic evaluation based on the annotations and the original assessment:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input values correctly: `n` (length of the strip), `field` (directions), and `power` (jump lengths). The annotations confirm that `n` is a positive integer, `field` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", and `power` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Initial Position**:
   - The grasshopper starts at position `pos = 0`.

3. **Jump Logic**:
   - The while loop correctly simulates the grasshopper's jumps:
     - It checks if the current position `pos` is within the bounds of the strip (`0 <= pos < n`) and if the jump length at the current position is non-zero (`power[pos] != 0`).
     - The direction of the jump is determined by the character in `field[pos]`. If it is '>', the grasshopper jumps to the right; if it is '<', the grasshopper jumps to the left.
     - The new position is calculated as `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`, which correctly handles both directions.
     - After each jump, the jump length at the current position is set to zero to avoid revisiting the same cell with the same jump length.

4. **Termination Conditions**:
   - If the grasshopper jumps out of the strip (i.e., `pos` is out of bounds), the program prints "FINITE".
   - If the grasshopper gets stuck in a loop within the strip (i.e., `pos` remains within bounds and `power[pos]` becomes zero), the program prints "INFINITE".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the grasshopper jumps out of the strip on the first move.
   - It also handles the case where the grasshopper gets stuck in an infinite loop within the strip.

The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution and handles all the edge cases as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation.
