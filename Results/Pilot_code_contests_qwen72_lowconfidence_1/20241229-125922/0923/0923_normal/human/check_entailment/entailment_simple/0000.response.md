Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` for reading the directions string, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy could cause issues if the program is intended to run in Python 3.
   - The program reads the input correctly but does not convert `n` to an integer, which can lead to issues in the loop condition.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:` ensures that the grasshopper continues jumping until it either goes out of bounds or reaches a cell with `power[pos] == 0`.
   - However, the program sets `power[pos]` to 0 after each jump, which means it marks the cell as visited. This is not necessary for determining whether the grasshopper will go out of bounds or enter an infinite loop.

3. **Infinite Loop Detection**:
   - The program does not explicitly check for infinite loops. Instead, it relies on setting `power[pos]` to 0, which can lead to incorrect results if the grasshopper revisits a cell multiple times without going out of bounds.
   - For example, in the second test case, the grasshopper's path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3, which is an infinite loop. The program should detect this and print "INFINITE", but it might not due to the way it handles the `power` array.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output condition `print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')` is correct in terms of logic, but it relies on the loop condition and the `power` array, which are not correctly implemented.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use `input()` instead of `raw_input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
- Convert `n` to an integer.
- Track the positions the grasshopper has visited to detect infinite loops.
- Use a set to keep track of visited positions and check if the grasshopper revisits a position.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    visited = set()
    
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        if pos in visited:
            print('INFINITE')
            return
        visited.add(pos)
        pos += (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
    
    print('FINITE')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly handle infinite loops and uses outdated input methods. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
