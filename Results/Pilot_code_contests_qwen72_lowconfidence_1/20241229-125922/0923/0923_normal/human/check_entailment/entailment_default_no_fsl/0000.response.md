Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the condition in the while loop and the final check for the position `pos` can lead to incorrect results.

### Issues:
1. **While Loop Condition**:
   - The condition `while 0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0:` ensures that the loop continues as long as `pos` is within the bounds of the field and the current cell's power is not zero.
   - However, this condition does not guarantee that the grasshopper will stop if it enters an infinite loop within the bounds of the field.

2. **Final Check**:
   - The final check `print('INFINITE' if 0 <= pos < n else 'FINITE')` assumes that if `pos` is within the bounds of the field after the loop, the grasshopper is in an infinite loop.
   - This assumption is incorrect because the grasshopper could be in a finite loop that eventually leads it out of the field, but the loop condition prevents it from continuing to the point where it would jump out.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
3
><<
2 1 1
```
- The grasshopper starts at position 0.
- From position 0, it jumps 2 cells to the right (to position 2).
- From position 2, it jumps 1 cell to the left (to position 1).
- From position 1, it jumps 1 cell to the left (back to position 0).
- This creates a loop: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> ...

The loop condition `power[pos] != 0` will prevent the loop from continuing indefinitely, but the final check `0 <= pos < n` will still be true, leading to the incorrect output "INFINITE".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the grasshopper will continue jumping indefinitely, you need to track visited positions and detect cycles. If a position is visited more than once, it indicates an infinite loop. If the grasshopper jumps out of the bounds of the field, it should be marked as "FINITE".

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    field = input().strip()
    power = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos = 0
    visited = [False] * n
    
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        if visited[pos]:
            print("INFINITE")
            return
        visited[pos] = True
        direction = 1 if field[pos] == '>' else -1
        pos += direction * power[pos]
    
    print("FINITE")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly identifies both finite and infinite paths.
