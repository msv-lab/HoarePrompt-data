The code snippet reads input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and maps each split part to an integer, storing the result in `power`. The initial state includes `n`, `directions`, `distances`, and `field`, which remain unchanged by this operation.

- `power` is now a map object that contains integers converted from the input string.
- The initial state variables (`n`, `directions`, `distances`, `field`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is a string input by the user, `directions` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", `distances` is a list of n integers where each integer di satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input.**
