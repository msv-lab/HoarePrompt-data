The code prints `'INFINITE'` if `pos` is within the bounds of `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), and prints `'FINITE'` otherwise. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object where all accessed elements are set to 0, `pos` is either out of bounds (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`) or at a position where `power[pos]` is 0, and either 'INFINITE' or 'FINITE' is printed.**
