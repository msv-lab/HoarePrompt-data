To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1**: `0 <= pos < n`
   - This ensures that `pos` is within the bounds of the `n`-length array.
   - Given that `pos` is initially set based on `field[0]` and `power[0]`, we need to ensure that `pos` remains within these bounds after the loop body executes.

2. **Condition 2**: `power[pos] != 0`
   - This ensures that the current position `pos` has a non-zero value in the `power` map.
   - If `power[pos]` becomes 0 during the loop body execution, the loop will terminate.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
- `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
- `field` is a string input by the user.
- `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0.
- `pos` is `power[0]` if `field[0] == '>'`, otherwise `pos` is `-power[0]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial `pos` Calculation**:
   - If `field[0] == '>'`, then `pos = power[0] = 0`.
   - If `field[0] != '>'`, then `pos = -power[0] = 0` (since `power[0]` is 0).

2. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `pos` must be within the bounds `0 <= pos < n`.
   - `power[pos]` must be non-zero.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `pos` is initially 0, the condition `0 <= pos < n` is satisfied as long as `n > 0`.
   - The condition `power[pos] != 0` must be satisfied. Since `power[0]` is 0, this condition will fail unless `pos` changes to a different index where `power` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `pos` moves to an index where `power` is non-zero and remains within the bounds of `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0, `pos` must be an index where `power[pos] != 0` and `0 <= pos < n`.**
