The code snippet initializes the variable `pos` to 0. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged initial state along with the new value of `pos`.

Output State: **`n` is a string input by the user, `directions` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", `distances` is a list of n integers where each integer di satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, `pos` is 0**
