To determine the final output state after the loop has completed its execution, let's analyze the loop and the conditions under which it operates. The loop continues as long as `pos` is within the bounds of `n` and `power[pos]` is not zero. Each iteration updates `power[pos]` to 0 and adjusts `pos` based on the direction indicated by `field[pos]` and the value of `power[pos]`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
- `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
- `field` is a string input by the user.
- `power` is a map object containing integers from the input.
- `pos` is 0.

### Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `power[0]` is set to 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[0] == '>') - 1) * power[0]`.
   - If `field[0] == '>'`, `pos` becomes `power[0]`.
   - If `field[0] == '<'`, `pos` becomes `-power[0]`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `power[pos]` is set to 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.
   - If `field[pos] == '>'`, `pos` increases by `power[pos]`.
   - If `field[pos] == '<'`, `pos` decreases by `power[pos]`.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - The same process repeats until `pos` is out of bounds (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`) or `power[pos]` is 0.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer.
- **`directions`**: Remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
- **`distances`**: Remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
- **`field`**: Remains the string input by the user.
- **`power`**: All elements in `power` that were accessed and modified during the loop are set to 0.
- **`pos`**: The final position of `pos` will be out of bounds (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`) or at a position where `power[pos]` is 0.

### Summary:
- The loop modifies `power` by setting the accessed elements to 0.
- `pos` is updated based on the direction specified in `field` and the value in `power`.
- The loop terminates when `pos` is out of bounds or when `power[pos]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object where all accessed elements are set to 0, `pos` is either out of bounds (`pos < 0` or `pos >= n`) or at a position where `power[pos]` is 0.**
