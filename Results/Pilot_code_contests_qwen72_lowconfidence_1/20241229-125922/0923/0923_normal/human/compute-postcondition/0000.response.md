The value of `n` is assigned the result of `input()`. The input function reads a line from input, converts it into a string, and returns it. Since the type conversion to an integer is not performed in the given code snippet, `n` will be a string containing the user's input.

Other variables (`directions`, `distances`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a string input by the user, `directions` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", `distances` is a list of n integers where each integer di satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9.**
