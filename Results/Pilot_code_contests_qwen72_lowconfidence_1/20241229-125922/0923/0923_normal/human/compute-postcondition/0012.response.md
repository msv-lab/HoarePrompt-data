The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `directions`, and `distances`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "<" and ">".
- `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on the parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes the `directions` and `distances` in some way, possibly to determine a specific result or perform a calculation. Without further details on the output, we cannot definitively state the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; `directions`, a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "<" and ">"; and `distances`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9. The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the given `directions` and `distances`.**
