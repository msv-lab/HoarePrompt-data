To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state to ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` statement:

The loop condition is `0 <= pos < n and power[pos] != 0`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `0 <= pos < n`:**
   - `pos` is 0, which satisfies the condition `0 <= pos`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `directions`, and since `n` is derived from a user input string, `n` must be a positive integer (as a string cannot have a non-positive length). Therefore, `pos < n` should naturally hold true for the first iteration.

2. **Condition `power[pos] != 0`:**
   - `pos` is 0, so we need to check `power[0]`.
   - `power` is a map object containing integers from the input. For the loop to execute, `power[0]` must be a non-zero integer.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- Ensure `n` is a positive integer, which is inherently true as `n` is the length of a string.
- Ensure `power[0]` is a non-zero integer.

Given that `n` being a positive integer is already implied by its definition as a string length, the primary adjustment needed is to ensure that `power[0]` is non-zero.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters "<" and ">", `distances` is a list of n integers where each integer di satisfies 1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` must be non-zero, `pos` is 0**
