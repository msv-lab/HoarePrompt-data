The given code snippet modifies the `power` map and updates the `pos` variable. Let's analyze the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
   - `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
   - `field` is a string input by the user.
   - `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0.
   - `power[pos]` is non-zero, and `0 <= pos < n`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - `power[pos]` is set to 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

4. **Detailed Calculation:**
   - `2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1` evaluates to:
     - 1 if `field[pos]` is '>'
     - -1 if `field[pos]` is '<'
   - Therefore, `pos` is updated to:
     - `pos + power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '>'
     - `pos - power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '<'

5. **Output State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
   - `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
   - `field` is a string input by the user.
   - `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0.
   - `power[pos]` is 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` before the assignment.
   - `0 <= pos < n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0, `power[pos]` is 0, `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` before the assignment, `0 <= pos < n`.**
