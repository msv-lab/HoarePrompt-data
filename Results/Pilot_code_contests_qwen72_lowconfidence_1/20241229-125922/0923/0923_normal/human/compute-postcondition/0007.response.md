The code snippet updates the `power` and `pos` variables based on the conditions provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
   - `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
   - `field` is a string input by the user.
   - `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0.
   - `pos` must be an index where `power[pos] != 0` and `0 <= pos < n`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `power[pos], pos = 0, pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]` updates `power[pos]` to 0 and changes `pos` based on the value of `field[pos]` and `power[pos]`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `power[pos]` is set to 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + (2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1) * power[pos]`.

4. **Calculations**:
   - The expression `(2 * (field[pos] == '>') - 1)` evaluates to 1 if `field[pos]` is '>', and -1 if `field[pos]` is '<'.
   - Therefore, `pos` is updated to `pos + 1 * power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '>', and `pos - power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '<'.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `directions` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`.
   - `distances` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`.
   - `field` remains the string input by the user.
   - `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0.
   - `power[pos]` is now 0.
   - `pos` is updated to `pos + power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '>', and `pos - power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '<'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `directions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters `<` and `>`, `distances` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `di` satisfies `1 ≤ di ≤ 10^9`, `field` is a string input by the user, `power` is a map object containing integers from the input, and `power[0]` is 0, `power[pos]` is 0, `pos` is updated to `pos + power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '>', and `pos - power[pos]` if `field[pos]` is '<', `0 <= pos < n`**.
