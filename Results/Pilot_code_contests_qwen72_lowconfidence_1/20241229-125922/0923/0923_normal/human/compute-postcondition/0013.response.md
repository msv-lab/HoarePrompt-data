Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list `power` of `n` integers. It then simulates a process where a position `pos` moves through the `field` based on the direction ("<" or ">") and the value in `power`. The position `pos` updates by moving forward or backward by the value in `power[pos]`, and the corresponding `power[pos]` is set to 0. This continues until `pos` is out of bounds or encounters a `power[pos]` that is already 0. The function prints "INFINITE" if `pos` ends within the bounds of `field` and "FINITE" otherwise. The function does not return any value. **

### Key Points:
- **Parameters:** The function implicitly reads three inputs: an integer `n`, a string `field`, and a list `power`.
- **Behavior:** The function modifies the `power` list by setting accessed elements to 0 and determines if the movement of `pos` is finite or infinite based on the conditions.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `pos` starts at a position where `power[pos]` is already 0, the loop exits immediately, and the function prints "FINITE".
  - If `pos` moves out of bounds (either less than 0 or greater than or equal to `n`), the function prints "FINITE".
  - If `pos` remains within bounds and all accessed `power` values are set to 0, the function prints "INFINITE".
- **Final State:**
  - The `power` list will have some elements set to 0.
  - The variable `pos` will either be out of bounds or at a position where `power[pos]` is 0.
  - The function will print either "FINITE" or "INFINITE" and terminate.
