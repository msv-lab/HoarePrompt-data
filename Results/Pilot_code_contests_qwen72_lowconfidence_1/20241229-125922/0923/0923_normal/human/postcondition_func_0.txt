The function reads an integer `n`, a string `field` of length `n` consisting of characters "<" and ">", and a list `power` of `n` integers. It then simulates a process where a position `pos` moves through the `field` based on the direction ("<" or ">") and the value in `power`. The position `pos` updates by moving forward or backward by the value in `power[pos]`, and the corresponding `power[pos]` is set to 0. This continues until `pos` is out of bounds or encounters a `power[pos]` that is already 0. The function prints "INFINITE" if `pos` ends within the bounds of `field` and "FINITE" otherwise. The function does not return any value.
