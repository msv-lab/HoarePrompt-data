#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n. p is a list of m distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, representing the indices of the special items to be discarded.

    data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, which depends on the values in `nums` and the original values of `offset` and `k`, `offset` is `m` (the final value of `i`), `i` is `m`, `op` is the total number of operations performed, which is the count of times the inner loop condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` was satisfied.
    print(op)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input from the user. The first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the total number of items, `m` is the number of special items to discard, and `k` is the position of the item to return. The second line contains a list of `m` distinct integers `p`, representing the indices of the special items to be discarded. The function calculates and prints the number of operations required to discard the special items in such a way that the k-th remaining item is determined. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The function handles edge cases where `n`, `m`, and `k` are within the specified ranges, and `p` is a sorted list of distinct integers. However, the function does not handle invalid input, such as non-integer inputs or inputs that do not meet the specified constraints.
