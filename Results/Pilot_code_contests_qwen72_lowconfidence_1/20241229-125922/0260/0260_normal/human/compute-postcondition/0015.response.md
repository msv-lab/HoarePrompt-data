To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
```

### Conditions Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `i < m`**
   - This condition ensures that the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `p` (which has length `m`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `m`.

2. **Condition 2: `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
   - This condition ensures that the value of `nums[i]` is within a certain range defined by `offset`, `curr`, and `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `k` is `data[2]`, and `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

### State Adjustments:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 2.
- **`nums[i]`**: The value of `nums[i]` (where `i` is 2) must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`. Given that `curr` is 0 and `offset` is 0, this simplifies to `nums[2] <= k`.

### Final State:
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 2
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is 0
- `offset` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `op` is 0
- `nums[2]` must be less than or equal to `k`

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 2, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, `op` is 0, and `nums[2]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
