To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

### Conditions in the `while` Loop
1. **Condition 1:** `i < m`
   - This condition checks if the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `p`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

2. **Condition 2:** `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`
   - This condition checks if the element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to the expression `offset + curr * k + k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[i]` must satisfy this inequality.

### Current State
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is an index such that `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`
- `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0
- `i` is increased by 1

### Analysis
- **Condition 1:** Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration to occur, `i` must be less than `m` before the increase. Therefore, `i` must be less than `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- **Condition 2:** The value of `nums[i]` must satisfy the inequality `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`. Since `i` is increased by 1, the next value to check is `nums[i+1]`. Therefore, `nums[i+1]` must satisfy the inequality.

### Adjustments Needed
- Ensure `i` is less than `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Ensure `nums[i+1]` satisfies the inequality `nums[i+1] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

### Final State
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is an index such that `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m - 1`, `nums[i+1] <= offset + curr * k + k`, `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0, `i` is increased by 1**
