The code snippet updates the value of `curr` based on the formula `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `curr` is initially 0.
- `nums[i]` is greater than `offset + curr * k + k`.
- Since `curr` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(nums[i] - (offset + 0 * k) - 1) / k`, which further simplifies to `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is `data[0]`.
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
- `k` is `data[2]`.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n.
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input.
- `curr` is 0.
- `offset` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `op` is 0.
- `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`.

After executing the code:
- `curr` is updated to `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0, and `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`.**
