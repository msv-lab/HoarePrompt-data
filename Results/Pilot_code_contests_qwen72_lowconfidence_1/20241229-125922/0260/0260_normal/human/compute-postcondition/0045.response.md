The code snippet `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. This operation only affects the variable `op`, and all other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `op` is `op + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k` where `i-1` is the last index checked, `offset` is `i`, `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, `op` is `op + 1`.**
