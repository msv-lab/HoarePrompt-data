According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop condition `i < m` must be true for the loop to execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, and `m` is `data[1]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted because the initial conditions (`i` being 0) already allow the loop to execute as long as `m` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0**
