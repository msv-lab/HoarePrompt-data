The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` was 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
