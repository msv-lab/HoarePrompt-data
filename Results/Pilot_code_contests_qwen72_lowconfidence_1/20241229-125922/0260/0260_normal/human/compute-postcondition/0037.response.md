To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < m`**
   - This condition ensures that `i` is within the bounds of the list `p` (which has `m` elements).
   - Given that `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to start.

2. **Condition 2: `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
   - This condition checks if the element at index `i` in `nums` is less than or equal to a calculated value based on `offset`, `curr`, and `k`.
   - For the loop to execute, this condition must be true for the initial values of `i`, `offset`, `curr`, and `k`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is `data[0]`: This is the total number of elements.
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0: This is the number of elements in the list `p`.
- `k` is `data[2]`: This is a parameter used in the calculations.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n.
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input.
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k` where `i-1` is the last index checked.
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`.
- `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists.
- `op` is 0 if `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, otherwise `op` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, then `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `i < m`**: Since `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, `i` must be less than `m` initially. This is already ensured by the definition of `i`.
- **Ensure `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**: This condition must be true for the loop to start. Given that `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, this condition will be false unless `i` is 0 and `nums[0]` satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 and `nums[0]` must satisfy the condition `nums[0] <= offset + curr * k + k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, and `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `k`**.
