The code snippet `offset = i` assigns the value of `i` to `offset`. The value of `i` is defined as the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k`. Since `offset` was initially 0, after this assignment, `offset` now holds the value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is `i`, `i` is the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k`, `op` is 0.**
