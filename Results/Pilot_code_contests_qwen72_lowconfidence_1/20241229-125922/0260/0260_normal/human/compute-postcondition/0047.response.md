The code snippet modifies the value of `curr` by adding the result of the expression \((nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k\) to it. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is `data[0]`
   - `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
   - `k` is `data[2]`
   - `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m \leq n\)
   - `data` is a list of integers read from user input
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
   - `curr` is either 0 or \((nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k\) where \(i-1\) is the last index checked
   - `offset` is either 0 or \(i\)
   - `i` is the smallest index such that \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\) or \(i\) is \(m\) if no such index exists
   - `op` is 0 if \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\), otherwise `op` is incremented by 1
   - Additionally, \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\)

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression \((nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k\) is computed.
   - This result is added to the current value of `curr`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.

4. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `curr` is now `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that \(1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m \leq n\), `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is the smallest index such that \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\) or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, `op` is 0 if \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\), otherwise `op` is incremented by 1, and additionally, \(nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k\).**
