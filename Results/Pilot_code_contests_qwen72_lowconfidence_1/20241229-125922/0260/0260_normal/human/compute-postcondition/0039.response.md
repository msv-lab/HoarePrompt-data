To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. The loop condition is `i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
2. We know the following from the given state:
   - `n` is `data[0]`
   - `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
   - `k` is `data[2]`
   - `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
   - `data` is a list of integers read from user input
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
   - `curr` is 0
   - `offset` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `i < m`
2. `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`

Let's break down these conditions:
- For `i < m` to be true, `i` must be less than `m`. Since `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied.
- For `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` to be true, we need to ensure that `nums[1]` (since `i` is 1) is less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.

Given the current state:
- `offset` is 0
- `curr` is 0
- `k` is `data[2]`

So, the condition simplifies to:
- `nums[1] <= 0 + 0 * k + k`
- `nums[1] <= k`

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Since all other conditions are already satisfied, no other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1, and `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
