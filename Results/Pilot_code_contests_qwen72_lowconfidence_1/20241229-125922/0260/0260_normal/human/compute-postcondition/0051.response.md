The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- `m` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, representing the indices of the special items to be discarded.

After executing the function body, the function returns the index of the k-th remaining item after discarding the special items at the indices specified in `p`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `p`, where `n` is the total number of items, `m` is the number of special items to discard, `k` is the position of the item to return, and `p` is a list of indices of the special items. It returns the index of the k-th remaining item after discarding the special items.**
