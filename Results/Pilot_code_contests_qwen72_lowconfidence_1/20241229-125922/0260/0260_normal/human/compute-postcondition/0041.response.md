To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `i < m`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.

2. **Condition 2:** `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to check the condition with `i = 2`.
   - The condition becomes `nums[2] <= offset + curr * k + k`.
   - Given that `curr` is 0 and `offset` is 0, the condition simplifies to `nums[2] <= k`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `nums[2]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 2, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nums[2]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
