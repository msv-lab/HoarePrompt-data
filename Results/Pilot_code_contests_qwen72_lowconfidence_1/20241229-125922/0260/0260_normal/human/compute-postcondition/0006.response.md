The code initializes the variable `offset` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged except for the addition of the `offset` variable.

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0**.
