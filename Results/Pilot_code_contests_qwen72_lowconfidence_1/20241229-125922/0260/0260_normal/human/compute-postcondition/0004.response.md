The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `nums`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, or `p`, but it introduces a new list `nums`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input.**
