The value of `m` is updated to the second element of the `data` list, which is `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]`, `k` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `p` is a list of m distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input.**
