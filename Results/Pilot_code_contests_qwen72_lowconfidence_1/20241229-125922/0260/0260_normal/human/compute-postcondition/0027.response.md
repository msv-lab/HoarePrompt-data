The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was previously an index such that `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m - 1`, after incrementing `i` by 1, the new index `i` must satisfy the condition `nums[i+1] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`.

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i-1`, `i` is increased by 1, `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k`, `i < m`, `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0**
