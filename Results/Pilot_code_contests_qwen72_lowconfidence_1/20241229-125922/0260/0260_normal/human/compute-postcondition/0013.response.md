To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1**: `i < m`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `m`.

2. **Condition 2**: `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `offset` is 0, `curr` is 0, and `k` is `data[2]`.
   - The condition simplifies to `nums[1] <= 0 + 0 * k + k`, which is `nums[1] <= k`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `i` must remain 1 (or increment to the next valid index) for the loop to continue.
- `m` must be greater than 1 to ensure `i` can be less than `m`.
- `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Since `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the only additional requirement is that `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 1, `op` is 0, and `nums[1]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
