To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1: `i < m`**
   - This condition checks if the index `i` is still within the bounds of the list `p`, which has `m` elements.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.

2. **Condition 2: `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
   - This condition checks if the current element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to the calculated value `offset + curr * k + k`.
   - The variables involved are `nums[i]`, `offset`, `curr`, and `k`.
   - `offset` is either 0 or `i-1`.
   - `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k`.
   - `k` is a fixed value from `data[2]`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i-1`
- `i` is increased by 1
- `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k`
- `i < m`
- `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the following:
- `i` must be less than `m` for the first condition to hold.
- `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k` for the second condition to hold.

Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is less than `m` (which is `data[1]`).
- `nums[i]` should be valid and satisfy the inequality `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Ensure `i` is less than `m`.
- Ensure `nums[i]` is valid and satisfies the inequality.

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i-1`, `i` is increased by 1, `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k`, `i < m`, `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0**
