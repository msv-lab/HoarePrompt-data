The code snippet `data = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `data`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within certain bounds, and `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers representing indices.

Given the initial state, the impact of this code snippet is:

- A new variable `data` is created and populated with a list of integers from the user input.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The list `p` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n. `p` is a list of m distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n. `data` is a list of integers read from user input.**
