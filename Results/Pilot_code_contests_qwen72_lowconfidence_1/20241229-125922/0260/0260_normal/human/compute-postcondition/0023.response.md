To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k` if the condition is true, otherwise `i` remains 0
- `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < m:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k`.

### Steps to Ensure the Loop Executes One More Time:
1. **Check the Value of `i`**:
   - If `i` is already equal to `m`, the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time.

2. **Update `i`**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` should be updated to a value that is still less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k`, we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.

3. **Update `curr` and `offset`**:
   - `curr` and `offset` are derived from `i` and `nums[i]`.
   - If `i` is updated, `curr` and `offset` may need to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be a valid index less than `m` and recalculate `curr` and `offset` based on the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is an index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`, `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0.**
