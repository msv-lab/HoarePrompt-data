To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `i < m`.

### Current State:
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k` where `i-1` is the last index checked
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists
- `op` is 0 if `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, otherwise `op` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, then `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`

### Analysis:
The loop condition is `i < m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, we need to ensure that `i` is not equal to `m`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is already defined as the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, and given that `m` is greater than 0, the only way to ensure the loop executes again is to ensure that `i` is not equal to `m`.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further beyond ensuring that `i` is less than `m`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i-1] - offset - 1) / k` where `i-1` is the last index checked, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is the smallest index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` or `i` is `m` if no such index exists, `op` is 0 if `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, otherwise `op` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k`, then `curr` is updated to `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`.**
