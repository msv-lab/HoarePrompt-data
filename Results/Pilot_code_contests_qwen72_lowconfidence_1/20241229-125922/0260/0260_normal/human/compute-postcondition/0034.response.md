The code snippet modifies the value of `curr`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is an index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`
- `op` is 0

The code updates `curr` using the formula:
```
curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial Value of `curr`:**
   - `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`.

2. **Update `curr`:**
   - The new value of `curr` is calculated as:
     ```
     curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
     ```

3. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Let's denote the expression `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` as `delta`.
   - Therefore, `curr` becomes:
     ```
     curr = curr + delta
     ```

4. **Final Value of `curr`:**
   - The final value of `curr` is:
     ```
     curr = curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
     ```

### Output State:
- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is now `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is an index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`
- `op` is 0

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is `curr + (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is an index such that `nums[i] > offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`, `op` is 0.**
