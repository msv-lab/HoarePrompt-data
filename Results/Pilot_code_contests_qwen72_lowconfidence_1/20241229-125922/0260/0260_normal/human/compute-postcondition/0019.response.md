The code snippet `op += 1` increments the value of `op` by 1. Given the initial state, `op` starts at 0, so after executing the code, `op` becomes 1.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is `i`, `i` is the maximum index such that `nums[i]` ≤ `offset + curr * k + k`, `op` is 1.**
