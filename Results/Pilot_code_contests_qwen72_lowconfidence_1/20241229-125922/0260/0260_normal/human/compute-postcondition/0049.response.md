Output State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]`, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is the final value of `curr` after all iterations, which depends on the values in `nums` and the original values of `offset` and `k`, `offset` is `m` (the final value of `i`), `i` is `m`, `op` is the total number of operations performed, which is the count of times the inner loop condition `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k` was satisfied.**
