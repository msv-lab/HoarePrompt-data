To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```python
while i < m and nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < m`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `offset` is 0.
   - `curr` is 0.
   - `k` is `data[2]`.
   - The expression `offset + curr * k + k` simplifies to `0 + 0 * k + k = k`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `nums[0] <= k`.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input.
- `k` is `data[2]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `nums[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is 0, `offset` is 0, `i` is 0, `op` is 0, and `nums[0]` must be less than or equal to `k`**
