To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `i < m`
   - This means `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to start.
   - Given that `i` is an index such that `i < m`, this condition should already be satisfied.

2. **Condition 2:** `nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`
   - This condition checks if the element at index `i` in the `nums` list is less than or equal to the value calculated from `offset`, `curr`, and `k`.

Let's analyze the given state variables and their relationships:

- `n` is `data[0]`
- `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0
- `k` is `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n
- `data` is a list of integers read from user input
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input
- `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`
- `offset` is either 0 or `i`
- `i` is an index such that `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`
- `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0

For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must be true initially:

1. **`i < m`**:
   - Since `i` is defined as an index such that `i < m`, this condition is inherently satisfied as long as `m > 0`.

2. **`nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k`**:
   - For this condition to be true, we need to ensure that the value of `nums[i]` is within the range defined by `offset + curr * k + k`.
   - Given that `curr` can be 0 or a calculated value, and `offset` can be 0 or `i`, we need to ensure that `nums[i]` is within a reasonable range to satisfy this condition.

Since `m` must be greater than 0 and `i` is an index less than `m`, the primary concern is ensuring that `nums[i]` is within the range defined by `offset + curr * k + k`.

Given the constraints:
- `nums[i]` must be less than or equal to `offset + curr * k + k`.
- `curr` and `offset` are defined based on `nums[i]` and `i`, so they should be consistent with the values in `nums`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state variables for the loop to execute at least once, assuming the initial values of `nums`, `i`, `offset`, and `curr` are consistent with the loop condition.

State: **`n` is `data[0]`, `m` is `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `m` distinct integers such that 1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m ≤ n, `data` is a list of integers read from user input, `nums` is a list of integers read from the current user input, `curr` is either 0 or `(nums[i] - offset - 1) / k`, `offset` is either 0 or `i`, `i` is an index such that `nums[i] ≤ offset + curr * k + k` and `i < m`, `op` is 1 if the condition is true, otherwise `op` is 0**
