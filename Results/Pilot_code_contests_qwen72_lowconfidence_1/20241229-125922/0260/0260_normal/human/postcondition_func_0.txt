The function reads two lines of input from the user. The first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the total number of items, `m` is the number of special items to discard, and `k` is the position of the item to return. The second line contains a list of `m` distinct integers `p`, representing the indices of the special items to be discarded. The function calculates and prints the number of operations required to discard the special items in such a way that the k-th remaining item is determined. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The function handles edge cases where `n`, `m`, and `k` are within the specified ranges, and `p` is a sorted list of distinct integers. However, the function does not handle invalid input, such as non-integer inputs or inputs that do not meet the specified constraints.
