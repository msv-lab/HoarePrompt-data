Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the problem description correctly for every potential case. Specifically, there are issues with the logic used to calculate the number of operations:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Page Offset**: The code uses `curr` to track the current page and `offset` to adjust the indices of the special items. However, the logic for updating these variables is flawed. For example, the condition `if nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:` does not correctly account for the movement of items after discarding special items on a page.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Special Items**: The code increments `curr` using the formula `(nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k`. This formula does not accurately reflect the movement of items after discarding special items, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the special items are distributed across multiple pages in a way that affects the number of operations. For example, consider the case where `n = 10`, `m = 4`, `k = 5`, and `p = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The code should correctly identify that all special items are on the first page and only one operation is needed, but the current logic might not handle this correctly.

Here is a specific example where the code fails:

**Example Input:**
```
10 4 5
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The code will likely output a different number of operations due to the incorrect logic for calculating the page offsets and handling the movement of items.

To ensure the program is correct, the logic for tracking the current page and adjusting the indices of the special items needs to be revised to accurately reflect the problem description.
