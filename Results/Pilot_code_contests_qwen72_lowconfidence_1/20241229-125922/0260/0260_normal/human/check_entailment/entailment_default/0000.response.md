Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code has an issue with how it calculates the current page (`curr`) and the offset (`offset`). The problem requires the function to simulate the process of discarding special items page by page, ensuring that the items move up as they are discarded. However, the logic in the code does not correctly handle the movement of items and the calculation of the current page, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
10 4 5
3 5 7 10
```
The expected output is `3`, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code might not correctly handle the movement of items and the calculation of the current page, leading to an incorrect result.

The main issue lies in the logic used to update `curr` and `offset`:
```python
else:
    curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k
```
This line does not correctly account for the movement of items after discarding. The calculation of `curr` and `offset` needs to be more precise to ensure that the items are correctly positioned and the page calculations are accurate.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least some potential cases.
