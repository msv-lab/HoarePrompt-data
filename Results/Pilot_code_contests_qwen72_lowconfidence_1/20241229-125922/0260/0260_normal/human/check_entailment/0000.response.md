Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to handle the problem description accurately for all potential cases. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the inputs `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of special items `nums` from the second line.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `curr` is initialized to 0, representing the current page index.
   - `offset` is initialized to 0, representing the number of items that have been discarded so far.
   - `i` is initialized to 0, representing the current index in the list of special items.
   - `op` is initialized to 0, representing the number of operations performed.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until all special items have been processed (`i < m`).
   - For each special item, it checks if the item is within the current page (considering the offset and the current page size).
   - If the item is within the current page, it discards all special items in the current page and updates the offset and operation count.
   - If the item is not within the current page, it moves to the next page by calculating the appropriate number of pages to skip.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where the special items are spread across multiple pages.
   - It also handles cases where all special items are in the same page.
   - The program correctly updates the offset and page index to ensure that the items are processed in the correct order.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of operations performed.

After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
