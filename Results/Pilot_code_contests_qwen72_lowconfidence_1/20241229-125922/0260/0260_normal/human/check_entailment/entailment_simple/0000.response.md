Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

### 1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is a Python 2 function. In Python 3, you should use `input()`. This is a critical error because the code will not run in Python 3, which is the more commonly used version today.
   - The program reads the entire input in one go and splits it into a list of integers. However, the problem description specifies that the input is provided in two lines: the first line contains `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains the list of special item indices. The program should read these inputs separately.

### 2. **Logic Issues:**
   - The program initializes `curr` to 0, which is intended to represent the current page number. However, the logic for updating `curr` and `offset` is flawed.
   - The condition `if nums[i] <= offset + curr * k + k:` is intended to check if the current special item is within the current page. However, the calculation `offset + curr * k + k` is not correct. The correct way to check if an item is within the current page should be `if nums[i] <= (curr + 1) * k`.
   - The update `curr += (nums[i] - (offset + curr * k) - 1) / k` is also incorrect. The correct way to update `curr` should be to find the next page that contains the next special item.

### 3. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations:**
   - The program increments the operation count (`op`) every time it finds a special item within the current page. However, the problem description states that Tokitsukaze discards all special items on the current page in one operation. The program should increment `op` only once per page, not for each individual special item.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the input correctly using `input()`.
2. Iterate through the special item indices and keep track of the current page.
3. Increment the operation count (`op`) each time a new page is processed and all special items on that page are discarded.
4. Update the current page number correctly to reflect the movement of items.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    curr_page = 1
    op = 0
    i = 0
    
    while i < m:
        start_of_page = (curr_page - 1) * k + 1
        end_of_page = curr_page * k
        
        # Check if the current special item is within the current page
        while i < m and start_of_page <= nums[i] <= end_of_page:
            i += 1
        
        # If there were special items in the current page, increment the operation count
        if i > 0:
            op += 1
        
        # Move to the next page
        curr_page = (nums[i] + k - 1) // k if i < m else curr_page + 1
    
    print(op)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input:** The program reads the input correctly using `input()` and splits it into `n`, `m`, and `k` on the first line, and the list of special item indices on the second line.
- **Page Calculation:** The program calculates the start and end of the current page using `start_of_page` and `end_of_page`.
- **Discarding Special Items:** The program checks if the current special item is within the current page and increments the index `i` if it is.
- **Operation Count:** The program increments the operation count (`op`) each time a page is processed.
- **Next Page:** The program updates the current page number to the next page that contains the next special item.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
