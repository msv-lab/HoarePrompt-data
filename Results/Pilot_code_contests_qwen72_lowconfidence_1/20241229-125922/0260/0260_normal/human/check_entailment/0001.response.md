Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of special item indices `nums`.

2. **Loop to Process Special Items**:
   - The program initializes variables `curr` (current page), `offset` (number of items already discarded), `i` (index in the `nums` list), and `op` (number of operations).
   - It enters a while loop that continues until all special items have been processed (`i < m`).

3. **Check Current Page**:
   - The program checks if the current special item (`nums[i]`) is within the current page (`offset + curr * k + k`).
   - If it is, the program discards all special items on the current page by incrementing `i` until it finds an item that is not on the current page. It then updates the `offset` to the number of items discarded and increments the operation count `op`.

4. **Move to Next Page**:
   - If the current special item is not on the current page, the program calculates the number of pages to skip to reach the page containing the current special item and updates `curr` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all special items, the program prints the total number of operations `op`.

The program correctly handles the movement of items and the calculation of the number of operations. It also correctly processes edge cases where the special items are spread across multiple pages and where the last page might be partially filled. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
