You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left
#Function 1:
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
    return res

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, r):
    if n < r:
        return 0
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])

#Function 3:
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
    return tem

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
