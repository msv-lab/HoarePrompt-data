You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `be` and `en` (where `be <= en`) and returns a list `res` where `res[0]` is 1, and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the function returns `[1]`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function should raise an error, but the current implementation does not handle this case and will return `[1]` instead.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, r):
    if n < r:
        return 0
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` (where `0 <= r <= n`). It returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `n - r`. The function assumes the existence of a precomputed list `facs` containing the factorials of non-negative integers up to at least `n`. If `facs` is not properly initialized or does not contain the required factorials, the function will raise an error or produce incorrect results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has either returned `0` or the computed factorial division result.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
    return tem
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `tem`. Each element in `tem` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `[0]`. The function correctly handles both non-empty and empty lists, ensuring that the returned list `tem` always starts with 0 and accurately reflects the cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a method to read a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input). Before returning, it redirects `sys.stdout` to a `BytesIO` object and registers an exit handler to write the contents of this `BytesIO` object to file descriptor 1 (standard output) upon program termination. The function effectively captures all subsequent `print` statements into a buffer and ensures they are written to standard output when the program exits. The returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
