Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the edge cases where the number of lamps `k` is equal to `n` (the total number of lamps). In such cases, the algorithm should check if there is a common time interval where all lamps are on, but the current implementation does not explicitly handle this scenario.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum arrays `cumbe` and `cumen` are calculated, but the logic for determining the number of valid combinations of `k` lamps is flawed. Specifically, the loop that iterates over `disbe[1:-1]` skips the first and last elements, which might lead to missing valid intervals.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The combination calculation using `func_2` is not entirely correct. The function `func_2` is intended to compute binomial coefficients, but the way it is used in the main loop might not correctly account for all valid combinations of lamps.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: The modulo arithmetic used in the combination calculations and the final result is not consistently applied, which might lead to incorrect results for large inputs.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the case where `k` is 1, which should always return `n` (the total number of lamps) because any single lamp can be chosen.

To ensure the code is correct, it should be thoroughly reviewed and tested against various edge cases, including:
- When `k` is 1.
- When `k` is equal to `n`.
- When there are no valid intervals where all `k` lamps are on.
- When the intervals are overlapping in complex ways.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
