You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).

for i in disbe[1:-1]:
    cur = cumbe[ordbe[i] + 1] - cumbe[ordbe[i]]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `be` and `en` (where `be <= en`) and returns a list `res` where `res[0]` is 1, and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the function returns `[1]`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function should raise an error, but the current implementation does not handle this case and will return `[1]` instead.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, r):
    if n < r:
        return 0
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` (where `0 <= r <= n`). It returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `n - r`. The function assumes the existence of a precomputed list `facs` containing the factorials of non-negative integers up to at least `n`. If `facs` is not properly initialized or does not contain the required factorials, the function will raise an error or produce incorrect results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has either returned `0` or the computed factorial division result.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
    return tem
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `tem`. Each element in `tem` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `[0]`. The function correctly handles both non-empty and empty lists, ensuring that the returned list `tem` always starts with 0 and accurately reflects the cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a method to read a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input). Before returning, it redirects `sys.stdout` to a `BytesIO` object and registers an exit handler to write the contents of this `BytesIO` object to file descriptor 1 (standard output) upon program termination. The function effectively captures all subsequent `print` statements into a buffer and ensures they are written to standard output when the program exits. The returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
