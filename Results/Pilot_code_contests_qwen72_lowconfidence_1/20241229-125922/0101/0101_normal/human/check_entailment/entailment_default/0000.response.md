Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to compute factorials, but it has a flaw in its logic. The function should handle the case where `be > en` by raising an error or returning an appropriate message, but it currently returns `[1]` in such cases, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the main logic of the program involves calculating the number of ways to choose `k` lamps such that there is a moment in time when all chosen lamps are turned on. The current implementation uses a combination of sets, dictionaries, and cumulative sums to achieve this, but there are several potential issues:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases, such as when `n < k` or when there are no overlapping intervals. While the problem description guarantees valid input, the code should still be robust enough to handle these scenarios gracefully.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The cumulative sum calculation in `func_3` is correct, but the way it is used in the main loop might not correctly account for all possible overlaps. Specifically, the logic for calculating `cur`, `val`, and `all` might miss some edge cases or overcount certain intervals.

3. **Factorial Division**: The function `func_2` relies on the precomputed `facs` list, which is generated by `func_1`. If `func_1` is incorrect, the entire factorial division logic will be flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
