Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully implement the solution for the problem described. Specifically, it lacks the main logic to solve the problem, such as processing the input data, calculating the number of valid combinations of lamps, and outputting the result. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are defined, but they do not collectively form a complete solution to the problem. Additionally, `func_4` is an attempt to optimize I/O operations, but it is not used in the context of solving the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
