You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ori and Sein have overcome many difficult challenges. They finally lit the Shrouded Lantern and found Gumon Seal, the key to the Forlorn Ruins. When they tried to open the door to the ruins... nothing happened.

Ori was very surprised, but Sein gave the explanation quickly: clever Gumon decided to make an additional defence for the door.

There are n lamps with Spirit Tree's light. Sein knows the time of turning on and off for the i-th lamp — l_i and r_i respectively. To open the door you have to choose k lamps in such a way that there will be a moment of time when they all will be turned on.

While Sein decides which of the k lamps to pick, Ori is interested: how many ways there are to pick such k lamps that the door will open? It may happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such k lamps. The answer might be large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

First line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — total number of lamps and the number of lamps that must be turned on simultaneously.

Next n lines contain two integers l_i ans r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) — period of time when i-th lamp is turned on.

Output

Print one integer — the answer to the task modulo 998 244 353.

Note

In first test case there are nine sets of k lamps: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7).

In second test case k=1, so the answer is 3.

In third test case there are no such pairs of lamps.

In forth test case all lamps are turned on in a time 3, so the answer is 1.

In fifth test case there are seven sets of k lamps: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

input = func_4()
add = lambda a, b: (a + b) % mod
mult = lambda a, b: a * b % mod
div = lambda a, b: mult(a, inv(b))
inv = lambda a: pow(a, mod - 2, mod)
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in input().split()]
mod = 998244353
(n, k) = rints()
a = [rints() for _ in range(n)]
(disbe, disen, ans) = (set(), set(), 0)
facs = func_1(1, 3 * 10 ** 5)
for (l, r) in a:
    disbe.add(l)
    disbe.add(r)
disbe = sorted(disbe)
ordbe = defaultdict(int, {disbe[i]: i for i in range(len(disbe))})
(cumbe, cumen) = ([0] * len(disbe), [0] * len(disbe))
for (l, r) in a:
    cumbe[ordbe[l]] += 1
    cumen[ordbe[r]] += 1
(cumbe, cumen) = (func_3(cumbe), func_3(cumen))
for i in disbe[1:-1]:
    cur = cumbe[ordbe[i] + 1] - cumbe[ordbe[i]]
    val = cumbe[-1] - cumbe[ordbe[i] + 1]
    val += cumen[ordbe[i]]
    all = n - val
    ans = add(ans, add(func_2(all, k), -func_2(all - cur, k)))
print(div(ans, facs[k]))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: be and en are non-negative integers such that be <= en.
def func_1(be, en):
    res = [1]
    for i in range(be, en + 1):
        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `be` and `en` are non-negative integers such that `be <= en`, `res` is a list where `res[0]` is 1 and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`, and the length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains `[1]`.
    return res
    #The program returns the list `res` where `res[0]` is 1 and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, `res` remains `[1]`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n, and n is not less than r.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of dividing `facs[n]` by `facs[n - r]`, where `facs` is a list of factorials, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= r <= n. The value returned is the factorial of `n` divided by the factorial of `n - r`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, `i` remains undefined and `tem` is `[0]`.
    return tem
    #The program returns `tem`, which is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, `tem` is `[0]`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem's context or the computation described in the problem statement. The function `func_4` does not take any parameters and is not directly related to the main problem of finding the number of ways to pick k lamps such that there is a moment when they are all turned on.
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a method that reads a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input).


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
