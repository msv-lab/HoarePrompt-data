Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program snippets do not form a complete solution to the problem described. Specifically, the main logic required to solve the problem, which involves finding the number of ways to pick `k` lamps such that there is a common time when all chosen lamps are turned on, is missing. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are defined, but they do not directly address the core requirement of the problem. Without seeing the actual implementation of the logic that processes the input and computes the result, we cannot conclude that the program is correct. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
