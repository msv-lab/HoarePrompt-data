Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input using a custom function `func_4()` which is designed to read from standard input and write to standard output efficiently. This part works as expected and is consistent with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The code initializes the necessary variables and data structures such as `facs` (factorials), `cumbe` (cumulative sums of start times), and `cumen` (cumulative sums of end times).
   - The sets `disbe` and `disen` are used to collect all unique start and end times of the lamps.

3. **Processing Lamps**:
   - The code processes each lamp's start and end times, updating the cumulative sums `cumbe` and `cumen` accordingly.
   - These cumulative sums are used to efficiently count the number of lamps that are on at any given time.

4. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to calculate combinations (binomial coefficients) modulo `998244353`. This is crucial for counting the number of valid sets of `k` lamps.
   - The function `func_1` precomputes factorials, which are used in the combination calculations.

5. **Counting Valid Sets**:
   - The main loop iterates over each possible time point, calculates the number of lamps that are on at that time, and uses the combination function to count the number of valid sets of `k` lamps.
   - The results are accumulated and returned modulo `998244353`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 1 or when there are no valid sets of `k` lamps.
   - The annotations and the code itself suggest that the code correctly handles these edge cases.

7. **Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code, producing the expected outputs.

Given the above points, the code appears to correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, including edge cases and examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
