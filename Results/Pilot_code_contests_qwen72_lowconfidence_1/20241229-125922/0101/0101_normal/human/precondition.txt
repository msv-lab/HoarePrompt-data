be and en are integers representing the start and end times of a period, where 1 ≤ be ≤ en ≤ 10^9. However, this function definition does not match the problem description provided. The correct function definition should be `def count_ways_to_open_door(n, k, intervals):` where `n` is the total number of lamps (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), `k` is the number of lamps to be turned on simultaneously (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `intervals` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (l_i, r_i) representing the period of time when the i-th lamp is turned on (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9).
