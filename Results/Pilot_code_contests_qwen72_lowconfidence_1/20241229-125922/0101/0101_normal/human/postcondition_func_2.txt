The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `tem`. Each element in `tem` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `[0]`. The function correctly handles both non-empty and empty lists, ensuring that the returned list `tem` always starts with 0 and accurately reflects the cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`.
