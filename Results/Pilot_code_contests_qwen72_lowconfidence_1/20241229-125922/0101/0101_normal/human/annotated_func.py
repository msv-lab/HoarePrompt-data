        res.append(mult(res[-1], i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `be` and `en` are non-negative integers such that `be <= en`, `res` is a list where `res[0]` is 1 and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`, and the length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains `[1]`.
    return res
    #The program returns the list `res` where `res[0]` is 1 and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, `res` remains `[1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `be` and `en` (where `be <= en`) and returns a list `res` where `res[0]` is 1, and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the function returns `[1]`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function should raise an error, but the current implementation does not handle this case and will return `[1]` instead.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_2(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n, and n is not less than r.
    return div(facs[n], facs[n - r])
    #The program returns the result of dividing `facs[n]` by `facs[n - r]`, where `facs` is a list of factorials, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `r` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= r <= n. The value returned is the factorial of `n` divided by the factorial of `n - r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` (where `0 <= r <= n`). It returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `n - r`. The function assumes the existence of a precomputed list `facs` containing the factorials of non-negative integers up to at least `n`. If `facs` is not properly initialized or does not contain the required factorials, the function will raise an error or produce incorrect results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has either returned `0` or the computed factorial division result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_3(arr):
    tem = [0]
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, `i` remains undefined and `tem` is `[0]`.
    return tem
    #The program returns `tem`, which is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, `tem` is `[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `tem`. Each element in `tem` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with an initial value of 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the function returns `[0]`. The function correctly handles both non-empty and empty lists, ensuring that the returned list `tem` always starts with 0 and accurately reflects the cumulative sums of the elements in `arr`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem's context or the computation described in the problem statement. The function `func_4` does not take any parameters and is not directly related to the main problem of finding the number of ways to pick k lamps such that there is a moment when they are all turned on.
def func_4():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns a method that reads a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a method to read a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input). Before returning, it redirects `sys.stdout` to a `BytesIO` object and registers an exit handler to write the contents of this `BytesIO` object to file descriptor 1 (standard output) upon program termination. The function effectively captures all subsequent `print` statements into a buffer and ensures they are written to standard output when the program exits. The returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input.
