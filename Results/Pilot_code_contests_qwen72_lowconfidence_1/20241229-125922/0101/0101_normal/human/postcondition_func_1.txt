The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r` (where `0 <= r <= n`). It returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the result of dividing the factorial of `n` by the factorial of `n - r`. The function assumes the existence of a precomputed list `facs` containing the factorials of non-negative integers up to at least `n`. If `facs` is not properly initialized or does not contain the required factorials, the function will raise an error or produce incorrect results. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has either returned `0` or the computed factorial division result.
