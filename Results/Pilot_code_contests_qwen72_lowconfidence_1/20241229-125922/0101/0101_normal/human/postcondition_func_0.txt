The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `be` and `en` (where `be <= en`) and returns a list `res` where `res[0]` is 1, and each subsequent element `res[k]` (for k > 0) is the product of all integers from `be` to `be + k - 1`. The length of `res` is `en - be + 2`. If `be == en`, the function returns `[1]`. If `be` is greater than `en`, the function should raise an error, but the current implementation does not handle this case and will return `[1]` instead.
