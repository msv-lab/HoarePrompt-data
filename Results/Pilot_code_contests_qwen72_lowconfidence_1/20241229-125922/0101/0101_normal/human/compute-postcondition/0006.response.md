The code snippet `tem.append(tem[i] + arr[i])` impacts the `tem` list by appending a new element to it. This new element is calculated as the sum of the element in `tem` at index `i` and the element in `arr` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the new element added to `tem` will be `tem[2] + arr[2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least three elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `tem` is `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1]]`.

Let's calculate the new element:
- `tem[2]` is `arr[0] + arr[1]`.
- `arr[2]` is the third element of `arr`.

So, the new element added to `tem` is `(arr[0] + arr[1]) + arr[2]`.

Therefore, the updated `tem` list will be `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], (arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2])]`.

The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is 2, `tem` is `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]]`**
