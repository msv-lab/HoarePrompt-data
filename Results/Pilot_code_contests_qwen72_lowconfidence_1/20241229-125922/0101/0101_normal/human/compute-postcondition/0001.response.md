The `atexit` module registers the given lambda function to be executed upon normal interpreter termination. This lambda function uses `os.write` to write the contents of `sys.stdout` (which is now an instance of `BytesIO`) to file descriptor 1, which typically corresponds to the standard output.

The initial state mentions that `sys.stdout` is an instance of `BytesIO`. This means that any writes to `sys.stdout` are captured in the `BytesIO` buffer instead of being immediately written to the console. When the program terminates normally, the lambda function registered with `atexit` will execute, and it will write the content of the `BytesIO` buffer to the standard output.

Since no other variables or their values are mentioned in the initial state, and the code only affects the behavior at the end of the program without changing any existing variable values, the output state remains largely unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem's context or the computation described in the problem statement. The function `func_4` does not take any parameters and is not directly related to the main problem of finding the number of ways to pick k lamps such that there is a moment when they are all turned on. `sys.stdout` is now an instance of `BytesIO`. A lambda function is registered with `atexit` to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output upon normal interpreter termination.**
