According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arr`. If `i` is less than the length of `arr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `arr` must have at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `arr` must have at least three elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is 2, `tem` is `[0, arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1]]`**
