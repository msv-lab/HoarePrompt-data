Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a method to read a line from a `BytesIO` object initialized with data read from file descriptor 0 (standard input). Before returning, it redirects `sys.stdout` to a `BytesIO` object and registers an exit handler to write the contents of this `BytesIO` object to file descriptor 1 (standard output) upon program termination. The function effectively captures all subsequent `print` statements into a buffer and ensures they are written to standard output when the program exits. The returned method can be used to read lines from the standard input. ** 

** Potential Edge Cases: **
- If the program exits abnormally (e.g., due to an unhandled exception), the registered exit handler might not run, and the buffered output may not be written to standard output.
- If the standard input is empty or closed, calling the returned method will result in an empty string or raise an exception, depending on the context.
- The function assumes that the entire standard input can fit into memory, which might not be true for very large inputs.
