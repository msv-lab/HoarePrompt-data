Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `head` is 0, `tail` is `n - temp`, `ret` is `n - temp`, and the current character `c` is `#`.**
