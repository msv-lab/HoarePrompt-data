Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` from the standard input. The string `S` consists only of the characters `.` and `#`. The function calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make all `#` characters adjacent to each other in the string. A move is defined as changing one character in the string from `.` to `#` or from `#` to `.`. If the string `S` contains only `.` characters or only `#` characters, the function prints `0`. The function does not modify the original string `S` or the integer `N`. The final state of the program includes the printed result, which is the minimum number of moves required. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the edge case where the string `S` contains only `.` characters or only `#` characters by printing `0`.
- The function correctly handles the general case where the string `S` contains both `.` and `#` characters by calculating the minimum number of moves required to group all `#` characters together.
- The function assumes valid input, i.e., `N` is within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of `.` and `#`. If invalid input is provided, the behavior is undefined.
