Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s` plus 1 if the new `c` is `#`. If `c` is `#`, `head` is 2, `tail` is `n - temp`, `temp2` is `n - temp + 1`, and `ret` is updated to `temp2` if `temp2` is less than `ret`. If `c` is not `#`, `head` is 0, `tail` is `(n - temp) - 1`, `temp2` is `n - temp - 1`, and `ret` is updated to `temp2` if `temp2` is less than `ret`.***
