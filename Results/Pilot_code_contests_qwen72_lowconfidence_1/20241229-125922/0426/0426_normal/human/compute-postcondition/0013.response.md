The value of `tail` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `tail` was `n - temp`, so the new value of `tail` is `(n - temp) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `head` is 0, `tail` is `(n - temp) - 1`, `ret` is `n - temp`, and the character `c` is not `#`**
