The value of `tail` is assigned the result of `n - temp`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, which is neither 0 nor `n`.

Therefore, `tail` will be the difference between `n` and `temp`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, and `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `head` is 0, `tail` is `n - temp`**
