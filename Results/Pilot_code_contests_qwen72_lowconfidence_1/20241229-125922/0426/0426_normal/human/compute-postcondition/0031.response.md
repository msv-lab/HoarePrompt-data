The value of `ret` is set to the value of `temp2`. The value of `temp2` depends on whether `c` is `#` or not. If `c` is `#`, `temp2` is calculated as `2 + (n - temp)`. If `c` is not `#`, `temp2` is calculated as `(n - temp) - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`
- `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s` plus 1 if the new `c` is `#`
- `head` is 2 if `c` is `#` otherwise 0
- `tail` is `n - temp` if `c` is `#` otherwise `(n - temp) - 1`
- `temp2` is `2 + (n - temp)` if `c` is `#` otherwise `n - temp - 1`
- `ret` is `2 + (n - temp)` if `c` is `#` otherwise `n - temp - 1`
