Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`. If `temp` is 0 or `temp` is equal to `n`, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `head` is set to `temp`, `tail` is set to 0, and `ret` is the minimum value of `head + tail` observed during the loop, which is the minimum of `temp` and any intermediate values of `head + tail`. The value of `ret` has been printed.***
