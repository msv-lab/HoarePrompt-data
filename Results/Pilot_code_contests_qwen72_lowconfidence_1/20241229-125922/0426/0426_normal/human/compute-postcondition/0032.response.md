Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s` plus 1 if the new `c` is `#`, `head` is 2 if `c` is `#` otherwise 0, `tail` is `n - temp` if `c` is `#` otherwise `(n - temp) - 1`, `temp2` is `2 + (n - temp)` if `c` is `#` otherwise `n - temp - 1`. If `temp2 < ret`, then `ret` is updated to `temp2`.***
