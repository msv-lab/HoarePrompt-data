`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` now represents this input, which should be an integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5. The string `S` remains unchanged and still consists of characters `.` and `#` with a length of `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5**
