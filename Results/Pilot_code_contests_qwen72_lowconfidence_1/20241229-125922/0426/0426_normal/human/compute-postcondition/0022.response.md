Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `head` is 1 if the new `c` is `#` and 0 otherwise, `tail` is `n - temp` if the new `c` is `#` and `(n - temp) - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `temp2` is `n - temp + 1` if the new `c` is `#` and `n - temp - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `ret` is updated if the new `temp2` is less than the current `ret`.***
