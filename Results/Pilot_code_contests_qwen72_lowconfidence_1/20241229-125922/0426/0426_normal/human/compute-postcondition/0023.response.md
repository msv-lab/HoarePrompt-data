The value of `temp2` is updated to the sum of `head` and `tail`. Based on the initial state, the value of `head` is 1 if the new `c` is `#` and 0 otherwise. The value of `tail` is `n - temp` if the new `c` is `#` and `(n - temp) - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`.

Thus, the possible values of `temp2` are:
- If the new `c` is `#`: `temp2 = 1 + (n - temp) = n - temp + 1`
- If the new `c` is not `#`: `temp2 = 0 + ((n - temp) - 1) = n - temp - 1`

The values of `N`, `S`, `n`, `s`, `temp`, `c`, `head`, and `tail` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `head` is 1 if the new `c` is `#` and 0 otherwise, `tail` is `n - temp` if the new `c` is `#` and `(n - temp) - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `temp2` is `n - temp + 1` if the new `c` is `#` and `n - temp - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `ret` is updated if the new `temp2` is less than the current `ret`.**
