Postcondition: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `ret` is `n - temp`, `head` is 1 if the current character `c` is `#` and 0 otherwise, `tail` is `n - temp` if `c` is `#` and `(n - temp) - 1` if `c` is not `#`, `temp2` is `n - temp + 1` if `c` is `#` and `n - temp - 1` if `c` is not `#`. Additionally, the current value of `temp2` is less than `ret`.**
