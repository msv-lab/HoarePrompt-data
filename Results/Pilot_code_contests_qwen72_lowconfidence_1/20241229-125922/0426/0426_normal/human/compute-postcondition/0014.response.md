Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `ret` is `n - temp`. If the current character `c` is `#`, then `head` is 1 and `tail` remains `n - temp`. If the current character `c` is not `#`, then `head` remains 0 and `tail` is decremented by 1 to `(n - temp) - 1`.***
