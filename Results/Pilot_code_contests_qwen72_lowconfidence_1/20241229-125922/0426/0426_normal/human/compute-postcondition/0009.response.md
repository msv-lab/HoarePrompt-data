To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`
- `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`
- `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`
- `head` is 0
- `tail` is `n - temp`
- `ret` is `n - temp`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for c in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **String `s`**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string.
2. **Length of `s`**: The length of `s` is `N`, which is given to be between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\). This ensures that `s` is non-empty.
3. **Characters in `s`**: The string `s` consists only of the characters `.` and `#`.
4. **Variable `temp`**: `temp` is the count of `#` characters in `s`, and it is given that `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`. This means there is at least one `.` and one `#` in `s`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `s` is non-empty**: This is already guaranteed by the condition \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- **Ensure `s` contains both `.` and `#`:** This is already guaranteed by the condition that `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`.

### Final State:
The loop will execute as long as `s` is a non-empty string containing both `.` and `#` characters. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring the initial conditions are met.

State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `temp` is neither 0 nor `n`, `head` is 0, `tail` is `n - temp`, `ret` is `n - temp`**
