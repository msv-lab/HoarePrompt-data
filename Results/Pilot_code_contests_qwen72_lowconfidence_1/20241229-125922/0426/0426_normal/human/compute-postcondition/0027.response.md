The value of `head` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `head` is 1 if the new `c` is `#` and 0 otherwise. After incrementing, `head` becomes 2 if the new `c` is `#` and 1 if the new `c` is not `#`.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `S`, `n`, `s`, `temp`, `c`, `tail`, `temp2`, `ret`) are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s` plus 1 if the new `c` is `#`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `head` is 2 if the new `c` is `#` and 1 otherwise, `tail` is `n - temp` if the new `c` is `#` and `(n - temp) - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `temp2` is `n - temp + 1` if the new `c` is `#` and `n - temp - 1` if the new `c` is not `#`, `ret` is updated to `temp2` if `temp2` is less than `ret`.**
