Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to handle the given constraints and test cases correctly. It calculates the minimum number of stones that need to be recolored to ensure no white stone is immediately to the right of a black stone. The logic of counting the initial number of black stones and then adjusting the counts as it iterates through the string seems to correctly find the minimum number of changes required. No edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the program to fail have been identified. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
