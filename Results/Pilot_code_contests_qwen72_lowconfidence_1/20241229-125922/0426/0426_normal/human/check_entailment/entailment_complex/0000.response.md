Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of stones that need to be recolored to ensure no white stone (`.`) is immediately to the right of a black stone (`#`). Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from standard input. This matches the problem description, which states that the input is given in the format:
     ```
     N
     S
     ```
   - The constraints are also respected: `1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5` and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of `.` and `#`.

2. **Initial Count**:
   - The program counts the number of `#` characters in the string `s` using `s.count('#')` and stores it in the variable `temp`. This is used to determine the initial state of the stones.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `temp` is 0 or `temp` is equal to `n`, it means all stones are either white or black, respectively. In these cases, no recoloring is needed, so the program prints `0`. This is correct according to the problem description.

4. **Dynamic Calculation**:
   - For the general case, the program initializes `head` and `tail` variables. `head` starts at 0 and `tail` starts at `n - temp`, which is the number of white stones.
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is `#`, it increments `head` because a black stone is encountered, and it should be moved to the left.
     - If the character is `.`, it decrements `tail` because a white stone is encountered, and it should be moved to the right.
   - The program calculates the current cost of recoloring as `head + tail` and updates the minimum cost `ret` if the current cost is smaller.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints `ret`, which is the minimum number of stones that need to be recolored. This is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program handles all edge cases and the general case correctly, ensuring that it always outputs the minimum number of stones that need to be recolored to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
