You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N stones arranged in a row. Every stone is painted white or black. A string S represents the color of the stones. The i-th stone from the left is white if the i-th character of S is `.`, and the stone is black if the character is `#`.

Takahashi wants to change the colors of some stones to black or white so that there will be no white stone immediately to the right of a black stone. Find the minimum number of stones that needs to be recolored.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
* S is a string of length N consisting of `.` and `#`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, and S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    temp = s.count('#')
    if (temp == 0 or temp == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        head = 0
        tail = n - temp
        ret = tail + head
        for c in s:
            if c == '#':
                head += 1
            else:
                tail -= 1
            
            temp2 = head + tail
            
            if temp2 < ret:
                ret = temp2
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`, `head` is `temp`, `tail` is 0, `ret` is the minimum value of `head + tail` observed during the loop, which is the minimum of `temp` and any intermediate values of `head + tail`.
        print(ret)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 × 10^5, `s` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `.` and `#`, `temp` is the number of `#` characters in `s`. If `temp` is 0 or `temp` is equal to `n`, the program does nothing. Otherwise, `head` is set to `temp`, `tail` is set to 0, and `ret` is the minimum value of `head + tail` observed during the loop, which is the minimum of `temp` and any intermediate values of `head + tail`. The value of `ret` has been printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
