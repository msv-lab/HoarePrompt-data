You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones arranged in a row. Every stone is painted white or black. A string S represents the color of the stones. The i-th stone from the left is white if the i-th character of S is `.`, and the stone is black if the character is `#`.

Takahashi wants to change the colors of some stones to black or white so that there will be no white stone immediately to the right of a black stone. Find the minimum number of stones that needs to be recolored.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
* S is a string of length N consisting of `.` and `#`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the minimum number of stones that needs to be recolored.

Program:

def func():

    s = raw_input()
    temp = s.count('#')
    if temp == 0 or temp == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        head = 0
        tail = n - temp
        ret = tail + head
        for c in s:
            if c == '#':
                head += 1
            else:
                tail -= 1
            temp2 = head + tail
            if temp2 < ret:
                ret = temp2
        print(ret)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to handle the given constraints and test cases correctly. It calculates the minimum number of stones that need to be recolored to ensure no white stone is immediately to the right of a black stone. The logic of counting the initial number of black stones and then adjusting the counts as it iterates through the string seems to correctly find the minimum number of changes required. No edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the program to fail have been identified. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` from the standard input. The string `S` consists only of the characters `.` and `#`. The function calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make all `#` characters adjacent to each other in the string. A move is defined as changing one character in the string from `.` to `#` or from `#` to `.`. If the string `S` contains only `.` characters or only `#` characters, the function prints `0`. The function does not modify the original string `S` or the integer `N`. The final state of the program includes the printed result, which is the minimum number of moves required.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
