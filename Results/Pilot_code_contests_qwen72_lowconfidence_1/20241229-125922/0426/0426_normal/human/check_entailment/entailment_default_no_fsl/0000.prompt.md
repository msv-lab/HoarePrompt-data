You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N stones arranged in a row. Every stone is painted white or black. A string S represents the color of the stones. The i-th stone from the left is white if the i-th character of S is `.`, and the stone is black if the character is `#`.

Takahashi wants to change the colors of some stones to black or white so that there will be no white stone immediately to the right of a black stone. Find the minimum number of stones that needs to be recolored.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
* S is a string of length N consisting of `.` and `#`.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the minimum number of stones that needs to be recolored.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = raw_input()
    temp = s.count('#')
    if temp == 0 or temp == n:
        print(0)
    else:
        head = 0
        tail = n - temp
        ret = tail + head
        for c in s:
            if c == '#':
                head += 1
            else:
                tail -= 1
            temp2 = head + tail
            if temp2 < ret:
                ret = temp2
        print(ret)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` from the standard input. The string `S` consists only of the characters `.` and `#`. The function calculates and prints the minimum number of moves required to make all `#` characters adjacent to each other in the string. A move is defined as changing one character in the string from `.` to `#` or from `#` to `.`. If the string `S` contains only `.` characters or only `#` characters, the function prints `0`. The function does not modify the original string `S` or the integer `N`. The final state of the program includes the printed result, which is the minimum number of moves required.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
