The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input and returns it. If the input is not a valid integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input or empty input, and it does not provide any error handling or feedback to the user. After the function concludes, the program will have read one line from standard input and returned an integer representation of that line, assuming the input was valid.
