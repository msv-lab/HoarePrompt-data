Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple segments start and end at the same point, leading to incorrect counts for the number of points covered by a specific number of segments.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 1
1 1
1 1
```

According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
0 0 1
```

However, the current implementation will produce:

```
3 0 0
```

This is because the program incorrectly increments the count for points covered by 3 segments, but it should actually be counting the number of points covered by exactly 1, 2, and 3 segments. The issue arises because the program does not correctly account for the overlapping of segments at the same point.

To fix this, the program needs to adjust how it handles the start and end points of segments, especially when they coincide. Specifically, the program should ensure that it correctly counts the number of segments covering each point, including points where multiple segments start and end.
