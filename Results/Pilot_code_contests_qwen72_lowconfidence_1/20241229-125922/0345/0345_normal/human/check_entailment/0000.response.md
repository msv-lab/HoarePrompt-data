Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it only defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`) for reading input and writing output, but it lacks the core logic needed to calculate the number of points covered by exactly `k` segments for each `k` from 1 to `n`.

To be correct, the program should include a main function that processes the segments, calculates the required counts, and prints the results. For example, it could use a sweep line algorithm to efficiently count the coverage of each point by the segments.

Here's a brief outline of what the missing core logic might look like:

1. Read the number of segments `n`.
2. Read the segments and store them in a list.
3. Use a data structure (like a list of events) to record the start and end points of each segment.
4. Sort the events by their positions.
5. Iterate through the sorted events, maintaining a count of how many segments are currently covering the current position.
6. Update the count of points covered by exactly `k` segments as you process the events.
7. Print the results.

Since the provided program does not include this core logic, it will not produce the correct output for any input, making it incorrect.
