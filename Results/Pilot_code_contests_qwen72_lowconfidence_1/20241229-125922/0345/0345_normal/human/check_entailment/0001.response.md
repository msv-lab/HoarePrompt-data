Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only defines several functions for reading input and writing output but does not perform the necessary calculations to determine the number of points covered by exactly `k` segments for each `k` in the range `[1, n]`. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for any input as it lacks the core algorithmic logic needed to solve the problem.
