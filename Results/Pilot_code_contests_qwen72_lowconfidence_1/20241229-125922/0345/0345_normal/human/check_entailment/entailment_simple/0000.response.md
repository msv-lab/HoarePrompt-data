Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of segments `n` using `func_1()`.
   - It then reads the endpoints of each segment using `func_2()` and stores them in the lists `T` and `M`.

2. **Coordinate Compression:**
   - The program sorts the list `M` which contains all the unique endpoints.
   - It uses a dictionary `f` to map each unique endpoint to a compressed index and another dictionary `invf` to map back from the compressed index to the original endpoint.
   - This step is crucial because it reduces the range of coordinates from potentially very large values (up to \(10^{18}\)) to a manageable size (at most \(2n\)).

3. **Difference Array:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `F` and `E` to keep track of the number of segments starting and ending at each compressed coordinate.
   - For each segment `(a, b)`, it increments `F[a]` and decrements `F[b + 1]` to mark the start and end of the segment's coverage.
   - It also increments `E[b]` to keep track of the number of segments ending at each coordinate.

4. **Cumulative Sum:**
   - The program computes the cumulative sum of the array `F` to get the number of segments covering each coordinate.
   - This step ensures that `F[i]` represents the number of segments covering the coordinate corresponding to the compressed index `i`.

5. **Counting Points:**
   - The program initializes an array `res` to store the count of points covered by exactly `k` segments.
   - It iterates through the compressed coordinates and updates `res` based on the values in `F` and `E`.
   - Specifically, it counts the points covered by exactly `k` segments by checking the difference between consecutive coordinates and adjusting for the segments ending at those coordinates.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results using `func_7()` and `func_8()`, which append the results to a global list `OUT` and then write the contents of `OUT` to the console.

### Why the Program is Correct

- **Handling Large Coordinates:** The program uses coordinate compression to handle the large range of coordinates efficiently.
- **Correct Counting:** The use of difference arrays and cumulative sums ensures that the program correctly counts the number of points covered by exactly `k` segments.
- **Efficiency:** The program runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time due to sorting and coordinate compression, making it efficient enough for the given constraints.
- **Output Format:** The program outputs the results in the required format, with `n` space-separated integers.

Given the above analysis, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
