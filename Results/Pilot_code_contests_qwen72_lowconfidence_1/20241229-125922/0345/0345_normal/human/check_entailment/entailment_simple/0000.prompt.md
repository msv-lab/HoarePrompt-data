You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n segments on a coordinate line; each endpoint of every segment has integer coordinates. Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.

Your task is the following: for every k ∈ [1..n], calculate the number of points with integer coordinates such that the number of segments that cover these points equals k. A segment with endpoints l_i and r_i covers point x if and only if l_i ≤ x ≤ r_i.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of segments.

The next n lines contain segments. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_i, r_i (0 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^{18}) — the endpoints of the i-th segment.

Output

Print n space separated integers cnt_1, cnt_2, ..., cnt_n, where cnt_i is equal to the number of points such that the number of segments that cover these points equals to i.

Examples

Input

0 3
1 3
3 8


Output

6 2 1 


Input

3
1 3
2 4
5 7


Output

5 2 0 

Note

The picture describing the first example:

<image>

Points with coordinates [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are covered by one segment, points [1, 2] are covered by two segments and point [3] is covered by three segments.

The picture describing the second example:

<image>

Points [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] are covered by one segment, points [2, 3] are covered by two segments and there are no points covered by three segments.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
