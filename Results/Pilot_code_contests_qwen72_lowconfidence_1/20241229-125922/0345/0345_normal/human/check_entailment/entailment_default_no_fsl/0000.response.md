Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read the number of segments and the segments themselves from the standard input. These functions handle the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Coordinate Compression**: The program uses a dictionary `f` to compress the coordinates. This is necessary because the coordinates can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), and directly working with such large numbers would be inefficient. By mapping each unique coordinate to a smaller index, the program can efficiently manage the segments.

3. **Difference Array**: The program uses a difference array `F` to keep track of the number of segments covering each point. For each segment \((a, b)\), it increments the count at the start of the segment and decrements the count just after the end of the segment. This allows the program to efficiently compute the number of segments covering each point.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program computes the prefix sum of the difference array `F` to get the actual number of segments covering each point. This step ensures that the counts are cumulative and correct.

5. **Counting Points**: The program then iterates through the compressed coordinates to count the number of points covered by exactly \(k\) segments for each \(k\) from 1 to \(n\). It correctly handles the edge cases where points are covered by multiple segments and where segments overlap or coincide.

6. **Output**: The results are collected in the list `res` and printed using the functions `func_7` and `func_8`.

The program handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including overlapping segments, nested segments, and segments that are points. The provided examples and the logic of the program align with the expected behavior, ensuring that the program is correct for every potential case.
