You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given n segments on a coordinate line; each endpoint of every segment has integer coordinates. Some segments can degenerate to points. Segments can intersect with each other, be nested in each other or even coincide.

Your task is the following: for every k ∈ [1..n], calculate the number of points with integer coordinates such that the number of segments that cover these points equals k. A segment with endpoints l_i and r_i covers point x if and only if l_i ≤ x ≤ r_i.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of segments.

The next n lines contain segments. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_i, r_i (0 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^{18}) — the endpoints of the i-th segment.

Output

Print n space separated integers cnt_1, cnt_2, ..., cnt_n, where cnt_i is equal to the number of points such that the number of segments that cover these points equals to i.

Note

The picture describing the first example:

<image>

Points with coordinates [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] are covered by one segment, points [1, 2] are covered by two segments and point [3] is covered by three segments.

The picture describing the second example:

<image>

Points [1, 4, 5, 6, 7] are covered by one segment, points [2, 3] are covered by two segments and there are no points covered by three segments.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. Specifically, it only defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`) for reading input and writing output, but it lacks the core logic needed to calculate the number of points covered by exactly `k` segments for each `k` from 1 to `n`.

To be correct, the program should include a main function that processes the segments, calculates the required counts, and prints the results. For example, it could use a sweep line algorithm to efficiently count the coverage of each point by the segments.

Here's a brief outline of what the missing core logic might look like:

1. Read the number of segments `n`.
2. Read the segments and store them in a list.
3. Use a data structure (like a list of events) to record the start and end points of each segment.
4. Sort the events by their positions.
5. Iterate through the sorted events, maintaining a count of how many segments are currently covering the current position.
6. Update the count of points covered by exactly `k` segments as you process the events.
7. Print the results.

Since the provided program does not include this core logic, it will not produce the correct output for any input, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
