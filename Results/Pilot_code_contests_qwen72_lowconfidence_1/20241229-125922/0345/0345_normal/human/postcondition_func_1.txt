The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting a line of space-separated integers. It then converts each string in the line into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty, the function will return an empty map object. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. The function does not handle any exceptions, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the input is valid or to handle any potential errors.
