The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and appends a formatted string representation of each element in the global variable `args` (which should be a tuple of integers or strings) to the global list `OUT`, followed by a newline character. After the function executes, `OUT` contains a string representation of each element in `args` followed by a space, and ends with a newline character. If `args` is an empty tuple, `OUT` remains unchanged except for the addition of the newline character.
