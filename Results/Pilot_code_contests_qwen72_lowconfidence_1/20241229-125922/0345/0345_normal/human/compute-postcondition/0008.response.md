Functionality: ** The function `func_7` processes a tuple `args` containing a series of integers or strings. It appends the string representation of each element in `args` to an external list `OUT`, which is defined in the outer scope. If `args` is empty, `OUT` remains unchanged. After the function executes, `OUT` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` in the same order as they appear in `args`. The function itself does not return any value. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `args` is empty, `OUT` remains unchanged, as correctly noted in the annotations.
- If `args` contains mixed types (e.g., both integers and strings), the function will still append their string representations to `OUT`.
- If `args` contains non-integer and non-string types (e.g., lists, dictionaries, custom objects), the function will attempt to convert these to strings and append them to `OUT`. This behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations but is a valid scenario based on the code.
