The code snippet `sto = ''.join(OUT)` joins all the elements in the list `OUT` into a single string, with each element being concatenated together without any separators. Since `OUT` is a list of strings, the result is a single string that contains all the strings from `OUT` concatenated together.

- `OUT` remains unchanged as a list of strings.
- A new variable `sto` is created and assigned the concatenated string value of all elements in `OUT`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`OUT` is a list of strings, `sto` is a string containing all elements of `OUT` concatenated together.**
