The function `func_4(sto)` is called with the argument `sto`. The exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, but assuming it returns a value (let's denote this returned value as `result`), the impact on the program state would be as follows:

- The variable `sto` is passed to the function `func_4`.
- The function `func_4` processes `sto` and returns a value.
- The value returned by `func_4` is not assigned to any variable, so no new variables are created or existing variables are updated with the return value.

Since the return value is not captured, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the potential side effects within `func_4` (which are not specified here).

Therefore, the Output State is: **`OUT` is a list of strings, `sto` is a string containing all elements of `OUT` concatenated together.**
