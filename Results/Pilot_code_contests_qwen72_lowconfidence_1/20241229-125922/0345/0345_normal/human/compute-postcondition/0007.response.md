The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, it interacts with a list named `OUT` that exists in the outer scope of the function. The function processes elements from a tuple `args` which contains a series of integers or strings. Based on the interaction with `args` and `OUT`, the function modifies the `OUT` list according to the elements in `args`.

Since the specific conditions or operations applied to `args` to modify `OUT` are not detailed, the general functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a tuple `args` containing a series of integers or strings and modifies an external list `OUT` based on the elements in `args`.**
