The function `func_7` processes a tuple `args` containing a series of integers or strings. It appends the string representation of each element in `args` to an external list `OUT`, which is defined in the outer scope. If `args` is empty, `OUT` remains unchanged. After the function executes, `OUT` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` in the same order as they appear in `args`. The function itself does not return any value.
