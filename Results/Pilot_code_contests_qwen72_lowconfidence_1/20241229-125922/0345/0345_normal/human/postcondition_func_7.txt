The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It modifies a global variable `OUT`, which is expected to be a list of strings, by joining its elements into a single string and passing this string to another function `func_4`. The function itself does not return any value. After the function executes, the global variable `OUT` remains unchanged, but the side effects of `func_4` (which are not specified in the provided code) may affect the program state. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `OUT` is not a list or contains non-string elements, which could lead to a `TypeError` when `join` is called. Additionally, if `func_4` modifies any global state or has other side effects, these changes will persist after `func_8` completes.
