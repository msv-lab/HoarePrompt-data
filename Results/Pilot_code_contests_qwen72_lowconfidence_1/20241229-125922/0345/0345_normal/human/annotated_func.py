#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read an integer from standard input.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from standard input and returns it. If the input is not a valid integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input or empty input, and it does not provide any error handling or feedback to the user. After the function concludes, the program will have read one line from standard input and returned an integer representation of that line, assuming the input was valid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and reads input from stdin, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the line of space-separated integers read from stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting a line of space-separated integers. It then converts each string in the line into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty, the function will return an empty map object. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. The function does not handle any exceptions, so it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the input is valid or to handle any potential errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments. It reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
    #The program returns a string read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from standard input, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string. If the input line is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of elements that can be converted to strings.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of elements that can be converted to strings. If `args` is not empty, the string representations of all elements in `args`, each followed by a space, have been written to the console. If `args` is empty, no output is written to the console.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a tuple `args` containing any number of elements that can be converted to strings. It writes the string representation of each element in `args`, followed by a space, to the console. If `args` is empty, no output is written except for a newline character. After the function completes, the console will contain the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by spaces, followed by a newline character. The original `args` tuple remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type.
def func_5():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, `s` is the last element processed (or undefined if `args` is empty), and the string representation of each element in `args` has been written to the console in the order they appear in `args`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no arguments directly but relies on a global variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. The function iterates over each element in `args` and writes the string representation of each element to the standard output (console) without any additional formatting or newlines between elements. After the function executes, the string representations of all elements in `args` have been printed to the console in the order they appear in `args`. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed to the console. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing integers or strings that represent the number of points covered by a certain number of segments.
def func_6():
    for s in args:
        OUT.append(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing integers or strings, `OUT` is a list where each element is the string representation of an element in `args` followed by a space, and the length of `OUT` is equal to the length of `args`. If `args` is an empty tuple, `OUT` remains an empty list.
    OUT.append('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and appends a formatted string representation of each element in the global variable `args` (which should be a tuple of integers or strings) to the global list `OUT`, followed by a newline character. After the function executes, `OUT` contains a string representation of each element in `args` followed by a space, and ends with a newline character. If `args` is an empty tuple, `OUT` remains unchanged except for the addition of the newline character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing a series of integers or strings, and OUT is a list that exists in the outer scope of the function.
def func_7():
    for s in args:
        OUT.append(str(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing a series of integers or strings, `OUT` is a list that exists in the outer scope of the function and now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` in the same order as they appear in `args`. If `args` is empty, `OUT` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` processes a tuple `args` containing a series of integers or strings. It appends the string representation of each element in `args` to an external list `OUT`, which is defined in the outer scope. If `args` is empty, `OUT` remains unchanged. After the function executes, `OUT` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` in the same order as they appear in `args`. The function itself does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_8`. The function assumes the existence of a global variable `OUT` which is a list of strings.
def func_8():
    sto = ''.join(OUT)
    func_4(sto)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters. It modifies a global variable `OUT`, which is expected to be a list of strings, by joining its elements into a single string and passing this string to another function `func_4`. The function itself does not return any value. After the function executes, the global variable `OUT` remains unchanged, but the side effects of `func_4` (which are not specified in the provided code) may affect the program state. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `OUT` is not a list or contains non-string elements, which could lead to a `TypeError` when `join` is called. Additionally, if `func_4` modifies any global state or has other side effects, these changes will persist after `func_8` completes.
