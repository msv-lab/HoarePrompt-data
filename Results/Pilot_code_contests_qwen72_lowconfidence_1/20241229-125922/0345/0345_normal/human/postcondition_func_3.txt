The function `func_4` accepts a tuple `args` containing any number of elements that can be converted to strings. It writes the string representation of each element in `args`, followed by a space, to the console. If `args` is empty, no output is written except for a newline character. After the function completes, the console will contain the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by spaces, followed by a newline character. The original `args` tuple remains unchanged.
