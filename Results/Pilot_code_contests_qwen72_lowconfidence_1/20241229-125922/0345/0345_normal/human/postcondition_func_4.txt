The function `func_5` accepts no arguments directly but relies on a global variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. The function iterates over each element in `args` and writes the string representation of each element to the standard output (console) without any additional formatting or newlines between elements. After the function executes, the string representations of all elements in `args` have been printed to the console in the order they appear in `args`. If `args` is empty, nothing is printed to the console. The function does not return any value.
