The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the value of `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `stderr`. No modifications are made to the input parameter `s` or any other part of the program state.
