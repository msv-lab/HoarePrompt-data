#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the value of `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `stderr`. No modifications are made to the input parameter `s` or any other part of the program state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function. If the user enters a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error (e.g., a `ValueError` if `int()` fails to convert the input). After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value representing the user's input, assuming the input was valid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature relate to the problem's input or constraints. The function `func_3` reads input and splits it into a list of integers, but does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input provided by the `inp()` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user (or another source, depending on the implementation of `inp()`), splits the input string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will either raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller has a list of integers derived from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a character, either '0' or '1'.
def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'
    #The program returns '1' if ch is '0', otherwise it returns '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a single character `ch` which can be either '0' or '1'. It returns '1' if `ch` is '0', and '0' if `ch` is '1'. The function does not handle any other input characters and assumes that the input will always be either '0' or '1'. After the function executes, the returned value will be the opposite of the input character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_5(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[0]
        #The program returns the first character of the binary string 'a'
    else :
        return func_4(a[-1])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the last character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips % 2 != 0`, the last character of `a` will be flipped (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0) before being passed to `func_4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns the first character of `a` if `flips` is even. If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the flipped last character of `a` (i.e., if the last character is '0', it becomes '1' and vice versa). The function assumes that `func_4` is defined elsewhere and processes its input in some way. Potential edge cases include when `a` is an empty string or when `flips` is zero. In these cases, the function will return the first character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is even, or it will attempt to flip the last character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is odd. If `a` is empty, the function will raise an IndexError.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_6(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[-1]
        #The program returns the last character of the binary string 'a'. Since 'a' is a binary string, the last character will be either '0' or '1'.
    else :
        return func_4(a[0])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the first character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips` is odd, if `a[0]` is '0', the function might return '1', or if `a[0]` is '1', the function might return '0'. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_4`, we cannot determine the exact output, but it will be the opposite of `a[0]` assuming `func_4` flips the bit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns a single character based on the value of `flips`:
- If `flips` is even, it returns the last character of the binary string `a`.
- If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the first character of the binary string `a`. Assuming `func_4` flips the bit, this means:
  - If `a[0]` is '0', it returns '1'.
  - If `a[0]` is '1', it returns '0'.
Edge cases:
- If `a` is an empty string, the function will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `a[0]` or `a[-1]`.
- If `flips` is zero, the function will return the last character of `a`, which is consistent with the even case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings of equal length, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'.
def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        
        flips += 1
        
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an empty deque, `b` is a binary string of equal original length, `out` is a list of integers representing the indices at which the binary string `b` did not match the result of `func_6(a, flips)` or required flipping, `flips` is the number of times a flip was performed during the loop execution. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` and `b` are initially empty), `a` remains an empty deque, `b` is an empty string, `out` is an empty list, and `flips` is 0.
    return out
    #The program returns an empty list `out`, as `a` is an empty deque and `b` is an empty string, meaning no operations were performed, and thus no indices were added to `out`. The number of flips `flips` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned.
