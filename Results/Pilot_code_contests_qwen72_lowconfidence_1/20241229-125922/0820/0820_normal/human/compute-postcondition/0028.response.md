The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `out` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1), `out` remains the same as determined by the conditions inside the loop.**
