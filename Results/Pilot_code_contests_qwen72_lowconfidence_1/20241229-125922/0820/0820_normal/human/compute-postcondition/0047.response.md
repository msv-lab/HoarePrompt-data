Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`). If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, and `flips` is incremented by 1. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, and `flips` is incremented by 1.***
