To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (two less than before).
- `b` is a binary string of equal length.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1` (which is one less than before).
- If `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.
- If `flips % 2 != 0`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a deque with at least one character.
   - `b` is a binary string of equal length to `a`.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1` (one less than before).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`a`**: Since the loop is iterating over the elements of `a` in reverse order, the state of `a` remains the same at the start of the next iteration.
- **`b`**: The state of `b` remains the same.
- **`i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `len(a) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `len(a) - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- **`out`**: The state of `out` depends on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, `out` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, `i` is decremented by 1. The other states remain the same.

State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (two less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `out` remains the same as determined by the conditions inside the loop.**
