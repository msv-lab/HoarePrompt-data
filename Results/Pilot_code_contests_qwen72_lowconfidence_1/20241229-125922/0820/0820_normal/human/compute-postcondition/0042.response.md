The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Given the initial state, the only effect is that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without altering any of the variables.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`), `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, otherwise `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
