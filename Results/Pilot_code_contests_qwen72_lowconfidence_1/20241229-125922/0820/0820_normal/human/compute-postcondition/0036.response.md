The code `a.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `a`.

- `a` was initially a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before).
- After executing `a.popleft()`, `a` will now have one fewer element from the left.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `b` is still a binary string of equal length.
- `i` is still `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1).
- The condition `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]` and the logic for updating `out` and `flips` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (four less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1), `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, otherwise `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
