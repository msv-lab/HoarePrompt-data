The `popleft()` method removes the leftmost element from the deque `a`. This operation modifies `a` by removing its first element. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string with at least one character, after the operation, `a` will contain one less character.

The other variables (`b`, `out`, `flips`, `i`) remain unchanged. The condition `flips % 2 != 0` also remains true. The result of `func_6(a, flips)` being equal to `b[i]` is still valid because the function's behavior is not affected by the removal of the leftmost element from `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less character than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `flips` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is equal to `b[i]`, `flips % 2 != 0`**
