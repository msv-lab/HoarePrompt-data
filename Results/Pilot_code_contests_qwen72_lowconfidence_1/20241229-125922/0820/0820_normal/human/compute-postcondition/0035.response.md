The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `a`. Since `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), removing the last element reduces its length by 1.

The states of `b`, `i`, `out`, and `flips` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (four less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by 1), `out` includes `len(a)` as its new last element if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, otherwise `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
