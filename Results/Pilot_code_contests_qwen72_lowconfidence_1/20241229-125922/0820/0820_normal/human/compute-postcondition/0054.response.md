The function `func_7` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both binary strings of equal length, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The function returns an empty list `out` and the number of flips `flips` is 0, indicating that no operations were performed due to `a` being an empty deque and `b` being an empty string.
