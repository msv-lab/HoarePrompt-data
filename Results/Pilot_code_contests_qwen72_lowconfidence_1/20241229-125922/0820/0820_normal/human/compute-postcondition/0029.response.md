Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1), `out` remains the same as determined by the conditions inside the loop, provided that `func_6(a, flips) == b[i]`. Otherwise, the state of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `out` remains unchanged as described in the precondition.***
