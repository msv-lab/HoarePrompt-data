The code snippet `out.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `out`.

- The value of `out` is updated to include an additional element `i + 1` at the end.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `flips` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state, only its relationship to `len(a)` and `flips`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`), `out` has two additional elements: `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
