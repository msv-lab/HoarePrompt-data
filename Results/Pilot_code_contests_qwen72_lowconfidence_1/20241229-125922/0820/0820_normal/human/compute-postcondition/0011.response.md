Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `func_6(a, flips) == b[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `func_6(a, flips) != b[i]`, the program proceeds with the next part of the loop (if any).***
