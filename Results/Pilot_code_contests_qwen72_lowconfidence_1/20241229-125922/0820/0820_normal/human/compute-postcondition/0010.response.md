The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end prematurely, and the control is passed to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context provided, it's assumed that this `continue` is part of a loop that was not included in the snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before).
- `b` is a binary string of equal length.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- If `flips % 2 == 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is equal to `b[i]`.
- If `flips % 2 != 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is still equal to `b[i]`.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but affects the flow of the loop it is in, causing the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, if `flips % 2 == 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is equal to `b[i]`, if `flips % 2 != 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is still equal to `b[i]`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
