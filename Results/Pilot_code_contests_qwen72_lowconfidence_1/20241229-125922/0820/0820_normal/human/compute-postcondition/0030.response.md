The value of `i + 1` is appended to the list `out`. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 2`, so `i + 1` is `len(a) - 1`. The states of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `out` now includes the new element.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element.**
