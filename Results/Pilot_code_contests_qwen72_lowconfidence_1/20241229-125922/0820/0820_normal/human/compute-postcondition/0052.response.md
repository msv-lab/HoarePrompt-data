Output State: **`a` is an empty deque, `b` is a binary string of equal original length, `out` is a list of integers representing the indices at which the binary string `b` did not match the result of `func_6(a, flips)` or required flipping, `flips` is the number of times a flip was performed during the loop execution. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` and `b` are initially empty), `a` remains an empty deque, `b` is an empty string, `out` is an empty list, and `flips` is 0.**
