The code snippet `out.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `out`. This operation modifies the `out` list by adding a new element at the end. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before)
- `b` is a binary string of equal length
- `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1)
- `out` contains one additional element, which is `1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `out` now contains two additional elements: the first is `1`, and the second is `i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1), `out` is the same as before with an additional element `1` and another element `i + 1` appended.**
