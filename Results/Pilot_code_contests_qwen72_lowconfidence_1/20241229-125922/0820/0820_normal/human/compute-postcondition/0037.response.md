Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (four less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1), `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, otherwise `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1. If `flips % 2 == 0`, the last element of `a` is removed. Otherwise, the leftmost element of `a` is removed.***
