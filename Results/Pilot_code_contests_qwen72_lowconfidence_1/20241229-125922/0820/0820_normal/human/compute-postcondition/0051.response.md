Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either five, six, or seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`), `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, and `flips` is incremented by 1.***
