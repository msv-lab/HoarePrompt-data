The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `flips` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `flips % 2 == 0`.**
