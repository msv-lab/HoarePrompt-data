The code snippet `out.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `out`.

- `a` remains a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before).
- `b` remains a binary string of equal length.
- `out` was an empty list and now contains the value `1`.
- `i` remains `len(a) - 1`.
- The condition `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is `[1]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`**.
