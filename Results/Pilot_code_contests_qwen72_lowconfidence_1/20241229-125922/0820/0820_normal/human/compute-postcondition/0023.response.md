Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (two less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (which is one less than before). If `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`. If `flips % 2 != 0`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.***
