Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If `flips % 2 == 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is equal to `b[i]`. If `flips % 2 != 0`, the result of `func_6(a, flips)` is still equal to `b[i]`.***
