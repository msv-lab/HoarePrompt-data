Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `flips` is `flips + 1`, and `flips % 2 == 0`. If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.***
