The code snippet `out.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `out`.

- The value of `out` is updated to include an additional element `1` at the end.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `flips` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`), `out` has an additional element `1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1` if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`; otherwise, `out` contains the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
