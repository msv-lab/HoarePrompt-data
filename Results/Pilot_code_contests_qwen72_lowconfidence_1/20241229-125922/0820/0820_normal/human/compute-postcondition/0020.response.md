The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `a`.

- **Impact on `a`:** The deque `a` now has one less element at the end.
- **Impact on `i`:** Since `i` is initially set to `len(a) - 1`, and `a` has lost one element, the new length of `a` is `len(a) - 1`, making the new value of `i` equal to `len(a) - 2`.
- **Other variables:** The values of `b`, `flips`, and `out` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (two less than before).
- `b` is a binary string of equal length.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `flips` is `flips + 1`, and `flips % 2 == 0`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`.
- If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (two less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `flips` is `flips + 1`, and `flips % 2 == 0`. If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.**
