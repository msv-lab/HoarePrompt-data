Postcondition: ***`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (three less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 2` (reduced by 1). If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element. Otherwise, `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`. The states of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
