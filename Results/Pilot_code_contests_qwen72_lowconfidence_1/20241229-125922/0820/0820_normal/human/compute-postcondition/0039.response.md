The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `a`. This affects the length of `a` and the value of `i`, which is derived from the length of `a`.

- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (six less than before).
- After `a.pop()`, the deque `a` will have one less character, making it seven less than the original binary string.
- `i` is `len(a) - 3`. Since `a` now has one less character, `len(a)` is reduced by 1, and thus `i` is also reduced by 1.

The other variables (`b`, `out`, `flips`) are not directly affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (seven less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (which is now one less than before), `out` includes `len(a) - 1` as its new last element if `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, otherwise `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, making it contain the elements `1` and `i + 1`, `flips` is incremented by 1.**
