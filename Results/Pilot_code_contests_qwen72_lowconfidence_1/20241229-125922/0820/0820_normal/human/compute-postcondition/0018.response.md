The code snippet increments the variable `flips` by 1. This affects only the value of `flips`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character (one less than before), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `flips` is `flips + 1`. If `func_5(a, flips) != b[i]`, `out` is a list containing the value `len(a)`. If `func_5(a, flips) == b[i]`, `out` is `[1, i + 1]`.**
