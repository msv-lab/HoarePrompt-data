The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the deque `a`. This affects the length of `a` by reducing it by 1. The other variables (`b`, `i`, `out`, and `flips`) are not directly modified by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before).
- `b` is a binary string of equal length.
- `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`).
- `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it.
- `flips` is incremented by 1.

After executing `a.pop()`, the updated state is:
- `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before, and now one less).
- `b` is a binary string of equal length.
- `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`).
- `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it.
- `flips` is incremented by 1.

Since `a` has one fewer element, `len(a)` is reduced by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be recalculated based on the updated length of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string (either six or seven less than before, and now one less), `b` is a binary string of equal length, `i` is `len(a) - 3` (if `flips % 2 == 0`, `i` is one less than before; otherwise, `i` is `len(a) - 4`), `out` has an additional element `i + 1` appended to it, and `flips` is incremented by 1.**
