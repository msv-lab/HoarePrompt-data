To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(a) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means the loop will execute if `len(a) - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a`.
   - `b` is a binary string of equal length.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `flips` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 0. This ensures that `len(a) - 1` is at least 0, allowing the loop to start.
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to `len(a) - 1` before the loop starts.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` is a deque of characters from the original binary string `a` with at least one character, `b` is a binary string of equal length, `out` is an empty list, `flips` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`**
