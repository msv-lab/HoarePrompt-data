Functionality: ** The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned. **

### Key Points:
- **Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings of equal length.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a list of integers representing the indices at which flips were necessary to make `a` match `b`.
- **Final State**:
  - `a` is an empty deque.
  - `b` remains unchanged.
  - The return value is a list of indices where flips were needed.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `a` and `b` are both empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - If `a` and `b` are identical, the function returns an empty list.
  - If `a` and `b` differ at certain positions, the function returns the indices of those positions.
  - The function correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are non-empty and differ, ensuring that the necessary flips are recorded and `a` is emptied.
