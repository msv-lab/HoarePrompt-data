The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned.
