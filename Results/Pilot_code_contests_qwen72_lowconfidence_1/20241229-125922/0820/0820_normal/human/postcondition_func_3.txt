The function `func_4` accepts a single character `ch` which can be either '0' or '1'. It returns '1' if `ch` is '0', and '0' if `ch` is '1'. The function does not handle any other input characters and assumes that the input will always be either '0' or '1'. After the function executes, the returned value will be the opposite of the input character.
