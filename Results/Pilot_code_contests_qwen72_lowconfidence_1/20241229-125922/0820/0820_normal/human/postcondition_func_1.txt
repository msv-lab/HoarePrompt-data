The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function. If the user enters a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error (e.g., a `ValueError` if `int()` fails to convert the input). After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value representing the user's input, assuming the input was valid.
