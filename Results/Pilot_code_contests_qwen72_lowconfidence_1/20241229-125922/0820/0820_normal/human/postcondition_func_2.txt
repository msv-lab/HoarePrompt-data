The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user (or another source, depending on the implementation of `inp()`), splits the input string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will either raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller has a list of integers derived from the input.
