The function `func_5` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns the first character of `a` if `flips` is even. If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the flipped last character of `a` (i.e., if the last character is '0', it becomes '1' and vice versa). The function assumes that `func_4` is defined elsewhere and processes its input in some way. Potential edge cases include when `a` is an empty string or when `flips` is zero. In these cases, the function will return the first character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is even, or it will attempt to flip the last character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is odd. If `a` is empty, the function will raise an IndexError.
