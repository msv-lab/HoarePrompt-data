You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.

For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.

Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 1000) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 3n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.

Example

Input

Output


3 1 2 1
6 5 2 5 3 1 2
0
9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5
1 1

Note

In the first test case, we have 01→ 11→ 00→ 10.

In the second test case, we have 01011→ 00101→ 11101→ 01000→ 10100→ 00100→ 11100.

In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length 2, which will leave a unchanged.
Functions with output description for each function:
from collections import *
import sys

try:
    inp = raw_input
except:
    inp = input
T = func_2()
for _ in range(T):
    N = func_2()
    a = list(inp())
    b = list(inp())
    out = func_7(a, b)
    print(' '.join(map(str, [len(out)] + out)))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the value of `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `stderr`. No modifications are made to the input parameter `s` or any other part of the program state.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function. If the user enters a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error (e.g., a `ValueError` if `int()` fails to convert the input). After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value representing the user's input, assuming the input was valid.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user (or another source, depending on the implementation of `inp()`), splits the input string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will either raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller has a list of integers derived from the input.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a single character `ch` which can be either '0' or '1'. It returns '1' if `ch` is '0', and '0' if `ch` is '1'. The function does not handle any other input characters and assumes that the input will always be either '0' or '1'. After the function executes, the returned value will be the opposite of the input character.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[0]
    else:
        return func_4(a[-1])
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns the first character of `a` if `flips` is even. If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the flipped last character of `a` (i.e., if the last character is '0', it becomes '1' and vice versa). The function assumes that `func_4` is defined elsewhere and processes its input in some way. Potential edge cases include when `a` is an empty string or when `flips` is zero. In these cases, the function will return the first character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is even, or it will attempt to flip the last character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is odd. If `a` is empty, the function will raise an IndexError.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[-1]
    else:
        return func_4(a[0])
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns a single character based on the value of `flips`:
- If `flips` is even, it returns the last character of the binary string `a`.
- If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the first character of the binary string `a`. Assuming `func_4` flips the bit, this means:
  - If `a[0]` is '0', it returns '1'.
  - If `a[0]` is '1', it returns '0'.
Edge cases:
- If `a` is an empty string, the function will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `a[0]` or `a[-1]`.
- If `flips` is zero, the function will return the last character of `a`, which is consistent with the even case.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        flips += 1
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
    return out
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
