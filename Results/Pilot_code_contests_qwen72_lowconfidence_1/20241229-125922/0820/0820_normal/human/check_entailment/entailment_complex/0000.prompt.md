You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.

For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.

Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 1000) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 3n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.

Note

In the first test case, we have 01→ 11→ 00→ 10.

In the second test case, we have 01011→ 00101→ 11101→ 01000→ 10100→ 00100→ 11100.

In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length 2, which will leave a unchanged.
Annotated Functions:
from collections import *
import sys

try:
    inp = raw_input
except:
    inp = input
T = func_2()
for _ in range(T):
    N = func_2()
    a = list(inp())
    b = list(inp())
    out = func_7(a, b)
    print(' '.join(map(str, [len(out)] + out)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the value of `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state will remain unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `stderr`. No modifications are made to the input parameter `s` or any other part of the program state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function. If the user enters a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error (e.g., a `ValueError` if `int()` fails to convert the input). After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value representing the user's input, assuming the input was valid.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature relate to the problem's input or constraints. The function `func_3` reads input and splits it into a list of integers, but does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input provided by the `inp()` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user (or another source, depending on the implementation of `inp()`), splits the input string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will either raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller has a list of integers derived from the input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a character, either '0' or '1'.
def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'
    #The program returns '1' if ch is '0', otherwise it returns '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a single character `ch` which can be either '0' or '1'. It returns '1' if `ch` is '0', and '0' if `ch` is '1'. The function does not handle any other input characters and assumes that the input will always be either '0' or '1'. After the function executes, the returned value will be the opposite of the input character.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_5(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[0]
        #The program returns the first character of the binary string 'a'
    else :
        return func_4(a[-1])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the last character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips % 2 != 0`, the last character of `a` will be flipped (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0) before being passed to `func_4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns the first character of `a` if `flips` is even. If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the flipped last character of `a` (i.e., if the last character is '0', it becomes '1' and vice versa). The function assumes that `func_4` is defined elsewhere and processes its input in some way. Potential edge cases include when `a` is an empty string or when `flips` is zero. In these cases, the function will return the first character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is even, or it will attempt to flip the last character of `a` if `a` is non-empty and `flips` is odd. If `a` is empty, the function will raise an IndexError.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_6(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[-1]
        #The program returns the last character of the binary string 'a'. Since 'a' is a binary string, the last character will be either '0' or '1'.
    else :
        return func_4(a[0])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the first character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips` is odd, if `a[0]` is '0', the function might return '1', or if `a[0]` is '1', the function might return '0'. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_4`, we cannot determine the exact output, but it will be the opposite of `a[0]` assuming `func_4` flips the bit.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes two parameters: a binary string `a` and a non-negative integer `flips`. It returns a single character based on the value of `flips`:
- If `flips` is even, it returns the last character of the binary string `a`.
- If `flips` is odd, it returns the result of applying `func_4` to the first character of the binary string `a`. Assuming `func_4` flips the bit, this means:
  - If `a[0]` is '0', it returns '1'.
  - If `a[0]` is '1', it returns '0'.
Edge cases:
- If `a` is an empty string, the function will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access `a[0]` or `a[-1]`.
- If `flips` is zero, the function will return the last character of `a`, which is consistent with the even case.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings of equal length, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'.
def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        
        flips += 1
        
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an empty deque, `b` is a binary string of equal original length, `out` is a list of integers representing the indices at which the binary string `b` did not match the result of `func_6(a, flips)` or required flipping, `flips` is the number of times a flip was performed during the loop execution. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` and `b` are initially empty), `a` remains an empty deque, `b` is an empty string, `out` is an empty list, and `flips` is 0.
    return out
    #The program returns an empty list `out`, as `a` is an empty deque and `b` is an empty string, meaning no operations were performed, and thus no indices were added to `out`. The number of flips `flips` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
