You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.

For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.

Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 1000) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 3n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.

Output

6 5 2 5 3 1 2
0
9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5
1 1

Note

In the first test case, we have 01→ 11→ 00→ 10.

In the second test case, we have 01011→ 00101→ 11101→ 01000→ 10100→ 00100→ 11100.

In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length 2, which will leave a unchanged.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys

try:
    inp = raw_input
except:
    inp = input
T = func_2()
for _ in range(T):
    N = func_2()
    a = list(inp())
    b = list(inp())
    out = func_7(a, b)
    print(' '.join(map(str, [len(out)] + out)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user through the `inp()` function.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature relate to the problem's input or constraints. The function `func_3` reads input and splits it into a list of integers, but does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input provided by the `inp()` function.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a character, either '0' or '1'.
def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'
    #The program returns '1' if ch is '0', otherwise it returns '0'.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_5(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[0]
        #The program returns the first character of the binary string 'a'
    else :
        return func_4(a[-1])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the last character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips % 2 != 0`, the last character of `a` will be flipped (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0) before being passed to `func_4`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a binary string, and flips is a non-negative integer.
def func_6(a, flips):
    if (flips % 2 == 0) :
        return a[-1]
        #The program returns the last character of the binary string 'a'. Since 'a' is a binary string, the last character will be either '0' or '1'.
    else :
        return func_4(a[0])
        #The program returns the result of `func_4` applied to the first character of the binary string `a`. Since `flips` is odd, if `a[0]` is '0', the function might return '1', or if `a[0]` is '1', the function might return '0'. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_4`, we cannot determine the exact output, but it will be the opposite of `a[0]` assuming `func_4` flips the bit.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings of equal length, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'.
def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        
        flips += 1
        
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is an empty deque, `b` is a binary string of equal original length, `out` is a list of integers representing the indices at which the binary string `b` did not match the result of `func_6(a, flips)` or required flipping, `flips` is the number of times a flip was performed during the loop execution. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` and `b` are initially empty), `a` remains an empty deque, `b` is an empty string, `out` is an empty list, and `flips` is 0.
    return out
    #The program returns an empty list `out`, as `a` is an empty deque and `b` is an empty string, meaning no operations were performed, and thus no indices were added to `out`. The number of flips `flips` is 0.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
