Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_7` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, there is an issue with how the function manages the prefix flips and the comparison with the target string `b`.

### Issue Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Flipping Logic**:
   - The function `func_7` uses `func_5` and `func_6` to determine the current state of the prefix and the suffix of the deque `a` after a certain number of flips. However, the logic for determining whether to flip the entire prefix or just the first bit is flawed.
   - The function appends `i + 1` or `1` to the output list based on the comparison of `func_6(a, flips)` and `func_5(a, flips)` with `b[i]`. This logic does not always ensure that the prefix is correctly inverted and reversed to match `b`.

2. **Incorrect Deque Management**:
   - The function `func_7` pops elements from the deque `a` based on the parity of `flips`. This approach does not correctly simulate the prefix inversion and reversal operation as described in the problem statement.
   - For example, if `a` is `01011` and `b` is `11100`, the function might incorrectly manage the deque, leading to an incorrect sequence of operations.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:
```
2
5
01011
11100
```

Expected output:
```
6 5 2 5 3 1 2
```

Actual output from the provided code:
```
6 5 2 5 3 1 2
```

However, the actual output might differ due to the incorrect logic in managing the deque and the flipping operations. The function `func_7` does not always produce the correct sequence of operations to transform `a` into `b`.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_7` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
