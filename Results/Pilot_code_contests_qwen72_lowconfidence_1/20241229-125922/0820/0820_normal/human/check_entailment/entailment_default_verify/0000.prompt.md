You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on n and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

There are two binary strings a and b of length n (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols 0 and 1). In an operation, you select a prefix of a, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.

For example, if a=001011 and you select the prefix of length 3, it becomes 011011. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes 001001.

Your task is to transform the string a into b in at most 3n operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 1000) — the length of the binary strings.

The next two lines contain two binary strings a and b of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 1000.

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0≤ k≤ 3n), followed by k integers p_1,…,p_k (1≤ p_i≤ n). Here k is the number of operations you use and p_i is the length of the prefix you flip in the i-th operation.

Output

9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5
1 1

Note

In the first test case, we have 01→ 11→ 00→ 10.

In the second test case, we have 01011→ 00101→ 11101→ 01000→ 10100→ 00100→ 11100.

In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length 2, which will leave a unchanged.
Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(inp())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]

#Function 4:
def func_4(ch):
    return '1' if ch == '0' else '0'

#Function 5:
def func_5(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[0]
    else:
        return func_4(a[-1])

#Function 6:
def func_6(a, flips):
    if flips % 2 == 0:
        return a[-1]
    else:
        return func_4(a[0])

#Function 7:
def func_7(a, b):
    a = deque(a)
    out = []
    flips = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1, -1, -1):
        if func_6(a, flips) == b[i]:
            if flips % 2 == 0:
                a.pop()
            else:
                a.popleft()
            continue
        if func_5(a, flips) != b[i]:
            out.append(i + 1)
        else:
            out.append(1)
            out.append(i + 1)
        flips += 1
        if flips % 2 == 0:
            a.pop()
        else:
            a.popleft()
    return out

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the transformation of string `a` into string `b` using the specified operations. The key functions and logic in the program are:

1. **func_5 and func_6**: These functions determine the current bit at the end of the deque `a` after a certain number of flips, considering the parity of the flips.
2. **func_7**: This function performs the main logic to transform `a` into `b`. It iterates through the string `a` from the end to the beginning, comparing the current bit of `a` (after accounting for flips) with the corresponding bit in `b`. If they do not match, it appends the necessary operations to the output list and updates the number of flips accordingly.

The program seems to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. For example:
- It correctly handles cases where the strings are already equal.
- It correctly handles cases where the strings differ by multiple bits and requires multiple operations to transform `a` into `b`.
- It ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of `3n`.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of different scenarios, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 7 : The function `func_7` takes two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length and processes them to identify and record the positions where a series of flips (inversions) are needed to make `a` match `b`. The function returns a list of integers representing these positions. If `a` and `b` are already identical or if they are both empty, the function returns an empty list. The function modifies `a` such that it becomes an empty deque by the end of its execution. The number of flips performed is tracked internally but not returned.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
