Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the key parts of the program and how they align with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `input_value` from the user, which represents Tokitsukaze's current HP. The problem description guarantees that `30 ≤ input_value ≤ 100`.

2. **Category Mapping:**
   - The `value_class` list `[3, 0, 2, 1]` maps the remainders of `n % 4` to their corresponding category indices in the `value_label` list `['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`. This mapping ensures that:
     - `n % 4 == 0` corresponds to category D (index 3 in `value_class`).
     - `n % 4 == 1` corresponds to category A (index 0 in `value_class`).
     - `n % 4 == 2` corresponds to category C (index 2 in `value_class`).
     - `n % 4 == 3` corresponds to category B (index 1 in `value_class`).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` returns the category index for a given HP value `n` by computing `n % 4` and looking up the corresponding value in `value_class`.
   - This function is used to determine the category of the current HP and the potential new HP values after increasing by 0, 1, or 2.

4. **Finding the Optimal Increase:**
   - The program initializes `top_value` with the category index of the current HP (`func_1(input_value)`).
   - It then iterates over the possible increases `[1, 2]` and checks if increasing the HP by these amounts results in a higher category (lower index in `value_class`).
   - If a better category is found, `top_add` and `top_value` are updated accordingly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the optimal increase `top_add` and the corresponding category label `value_label[top_value]`.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Category Calculation:** The `value_class` list and the `func_1` function correctly map the remainders of `n % 4` to the appropriate categories.
- **Optimization Logic:** The program correctly iterates over the possible increases (0, 1, 2) and selects the one that results in the highest category.
- **Output Format:** The output format matches the problem description, printing the optimal increase followed by the corresponding category label.

Since the program correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified range and produces the expected output, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
