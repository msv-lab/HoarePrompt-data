You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Tokitsukaze is one of the characters in the game "Kantai Collection". In this game, every character has a common attribute — health points, shortened to HP.

In general, different values of HP are grouped into 4 categories:

  * Category A if HP is in the form of (4 n + 1), that is, when divided by 4, the remainder is 1; 
  * Category B if HP is in the form of (4 n + 3), that is, when divided by 4, the remainder is 3; 
  * Category C if HP is in the form of (4 n + 2), that is, when divided by 4, the remainder is 2; 
  * Category D if HP is in the form of 4 n, that is, when divided by 4, the remainder is 0. 



The above-mentioned n can be any integer.

These 4 categories ordered from highest to lowest as A > B > C > D, which means category A is the highest and category D is the lowest.

While playing the game, players can increase the HP of the character. Now, Tokitsukaze wants you to increase her HP by at most 2 (that is, either by 0, 1 or 2). How much should she increase her HP so that it has the highest possible category?

Input

The only line contains a single integer x (30 ≤ x ≤ 100) — the value Tokitsukaze's HP currently.

Output

Print an integer a (0 ≤ a ≤ 2) and an uppercase letter b (b ∈ { A, B, C, D }), representing that the best way is to increase her HP by a, and then the category becomes b.

Note that the output characters are case-sensitive.

Examples

Input


33


Output


0 A


Input


98


Output


1 B

Note

For the first example, the category of Tokitsukaze's HP is already A, so you don't need to enhance her ability.

For the second example:

  * If you don't increase her HP, its value is still 98, which equals to (4 × 24 + 2), and its category is C. 
  * If you increase her HP by 1, its value becomes 99, which equals to (4 × 24 + 3), and its category becomes B. 
  * If you increase her HP by 2, its value becomes 100, which equals to (4 × 25), and its category becomes D. 



Therefore, the best way is to increase her HP by 1 so that the category of her HP becomes B.
Program:
```
input_value = int(input())
value_class = [3, 0, 2, 1]
value_label = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
top_value = func_1(input_value)
top_add = 0
for add in [1, 2]:
    add_val = func_1(input_value + add)
    if add_val < top_value:
        top_add = add
        top_value = add_val
print(str(top_add) + ' ' + value_label[top_value])

def func_1(n):
    return value_class[n % 4]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to handle all potential cases correctly based on the problem description. It uses a function `func_1` to map the HP values to their respective categories using a list `value_class` and a corresponding label list `value_label`. The main logic iterates over possible increments (0, 1, 2) and selects the increment that results in the highest category (smallest index in `value_class`). 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. `func_1(n)` returns the category index of the HP value `n` based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 4.
2. The program initializes `top_value` with the current category of the input HP.
3. It then checks the categories for the HP values incremented by 1 and 2, updating `top_value` and `top_add` if a higher category is found.
4. Finally, it prints the best increment and the resulting category.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the examples provided in the problem description. For instance:
- For `input_value = 33`, the program correctly outputs `0 A`.
- For `input_value = 98`, the program correctly outputs `1 B`.

Since the program works as expected for all tested cases and the logic aligns with the problem requirements, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input_value = int(input())
value_class = [3, 0, 2, 1]
value_label = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
top_value = func_1(input_value)
top_add = 0
for add in [1, 2]:
    add_val = func_1(input_value + add)
    if add_val < top_value:
        top_add = add
        top_value = add_val
print(str(top_add) + ' ' + value_label[top_value])

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 30 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(n):
    return value_class[n % 4]
    #The program returns one of the elements from `value_class` at index 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `n % 4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where `30 <= n <= 100`. It returns one of the elements from the `value_class` list based on the index `n % 4`, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The function does not modify the input `n` or any other external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned one of the four possible elements from `value_class`. If `value_class` is not defined or does not have at least 4 elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
