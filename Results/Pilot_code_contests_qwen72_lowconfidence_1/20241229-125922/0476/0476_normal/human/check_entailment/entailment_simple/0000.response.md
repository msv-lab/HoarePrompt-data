Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description and meets all the requirements specified. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `input_value` from the standard input, which represents the current HP of Tokitsukaze. The problem specifies that this value will be between 30 and 100 inclusive.

2. **Mapping HP to Categories:**
   - The program uses a list `value_class` to map the remainder of `HP % 4` to the corresponding category index:
     - `value_class[0]` corresponds to category D (remainder 0).
     - `value_class[1]` corresponds to category A (remainder 1).
     - `value_class[2]` corresponds to category C (remainder 2).
     - `value_class[3]` corresponds to category B (remainder 3).
   - The list `value_label` maps these indices to their respective category labels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D').

3. **Finding the Best Increase:**
   - The program initializes `top_value` with the current category index of the HP using the function `func_1`.
   - It then iterates over possible increases of 1 and 2, calculating the new category index for each increased HP.
   - If a higher category (lower index in `value_class`) is found, it updates `top_value` and `top_add` accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the best increase (`top_add`) and the corresponding category label (`value_label[top_value]`).

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Initial Category Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1(n)` correctly returns the category index based on `n % 4`, which matches the problem description.

- **Best Increase Calculation:**
  - The program checks both possible increases (1 and 2) and selects the one that results in the highest category. This ensures that the HP is increased by the smallest amount necessary to achieve the highest possible category.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format is correct, printing the increase amount followed by the category label, which matches the problem description.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `33`
  - Current category: `33 % 4 = 1` → Category A
  - No increase needed.
  - Output: `0 A`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `98`
  - Current category: `98 % 4 = 2` → Category C
  - Check increase by 1: `99 % 4 = 3` → Category B
  - Check increase by 2: `100 % 4 = 0` → Category D
  - Best increase: 1 (Category B)
  - Output: `1 B`

Given the above analysis, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
