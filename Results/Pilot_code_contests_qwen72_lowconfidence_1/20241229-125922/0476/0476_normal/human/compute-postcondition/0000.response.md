Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 30 <= n <= 100.
```
return value_class[n % 4]
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.

- `n` is an integer between 30 and 100 (inclusive).
- The expression `n % 4` calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 4. This will result in one of the values: 0, 1, 2, or 3.
- `value_class` is assumed to be a list or similar structure that can be indexed. The index used is the result of `n % 4`.

Since `n` can be any integer from 30 to 100, let's consider the possible remainders:

- If `n % 4 == 0`, the index is 0.
- If `n % 4 == 1`, the index is 1.
- If `n % 4 == 2`, the index is 2.
- If `n % 4 == 3`, the index is 3.

Therefore, the program will return one of the elements from `value_class` at index 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Output State: **The program returns one of the elements from `value_class` at index 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `n % 4`.**
