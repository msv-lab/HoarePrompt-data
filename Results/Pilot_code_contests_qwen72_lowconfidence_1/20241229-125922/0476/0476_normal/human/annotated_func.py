#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 30 <= n <= 100.
def func_1(n):
    return value_class[n % 4]
    #The program returns one of the elements from `value_class` at index 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `n % 4`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where `30 <= n <= 100`. It returns one of the elements from the `value_class` list based on the index `n % 4`, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The function does not modify the input `n` or any other external state. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned one of the four possible elements from `value_class`. If `value_class` is not defined or does not have at least 4 elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
