#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a 2D list `matrix` of strings where each string is either "." or "#", and two positive integers `n` and `m` indicating the dimensions of the matrix (n rows and m columns). It returns two lists, `black_cost` and `white_cost`, each of length `m`. `black_cost` contains the count of "." in each column, and `white_cost` contains the count of "#" in each column. The function correctly counts the occurrences of "." and "#" in each column and populates the respective lists accordingly. If the matrix is empty or contains invalid characters (not "." or "#"), the function will still execute but may produce incorrect results.
