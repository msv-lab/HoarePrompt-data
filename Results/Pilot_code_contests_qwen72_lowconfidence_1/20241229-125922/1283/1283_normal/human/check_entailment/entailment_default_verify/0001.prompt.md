You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got an n × m pixel picture. Each pixel can be white or black. Your task is to change the colors of as few pixels as possible to obtain a barcode picture.

A picture is a barcode if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * All pixels in each column are of the same color. 
  * The width of each monochrome vertical line is at least x and at most y pixels. In other words, if we group all neighbouring columns of the pixels with equal color, the size of each group can not be less than x or greater than y. 

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers n, m, x and y (1 ≤ n, m, x, y ≤ 1000; x ≤ y).

Then follow n lines, describing the original image. Each of these lines contains exactly m characters. Character "." represents a white pixel and "#" represents a black pixel. The picture description doesn't have any other characters besides "." and "#".

Output

In the first line print the minimum number of pixels to repaint. It is guaranteed that the answer exists. 

Examples

##.#.

Input

2 5 1 1
#####

Output

Note

In the first test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    .##..  
    

In the second test sample the picture after changing some colors can looks as follows: 
    
    
      
    .#.#.  
    .#.#.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a potential issue in handling edge cases, particularly when the minimum width `x` is equal to the maximum width `y`. In such cases, the recursive function `func_2` may not correctly handle the transition between different segments of the barcode, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3 2 2
###
...
###
```
In this case, the program should output `3`, as we need to change the middle column to match the other two columns to form a valid barcode. However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the transition between segments of width `2`, leading to an incorrect result.

This specific edge case demonstrates that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function does not handle cases where the `black_cost` or `white_cost` lists are shorter than `m`, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors. Additionally, the function assumes that `dp1` and `dp2` are correctly initialized to -1, but this is not checked within the function.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
