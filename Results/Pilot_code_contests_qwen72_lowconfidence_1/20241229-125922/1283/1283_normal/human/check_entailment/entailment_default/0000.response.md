Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the `black_cost` or `white_cost` lists are shorter than `m`, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors. Additionally, the function `func_2` assumes that `dp1` and `dp2` are correctly initialized to -1, but this is not checked within the function. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the initialization is incorrect. Furthermore, the function does not correctly handle the transition between different color segments when the width constraints (`x` and `y`) are not met, which can result in suboptimal solutions or incorrect results. For example, if the input matrix has a segment that cannot be made into a valid barcode segment due to the width constraints, the function may not correctly propagate the minimum cost, leading to an incorrect final result.
