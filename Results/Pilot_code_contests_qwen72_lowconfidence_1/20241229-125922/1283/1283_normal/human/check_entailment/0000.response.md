Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the initialization of the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays, which are used for dynamic programming. These arrays are not defined or initialized before being used in the `func_2` function, leading to a potential error. Specifically, the line `if dp1[w][index] != -1 and dp2[b][index] != -1:` will raise an error if `dp1` or `dp2` are not properly initialized with the correct dimensions and default values.

To fix this, `dp1` and `dp2` should be initialized with dimensions that cover all possible states, typically using a large enough value to represent infinity. For example:

```python
dp1 = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(y + 1)]
dp2 = [[-1 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(y + 1)]
```

This initialization ensures that the program can correctly use and update the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays without encountering out-of-bounds errors or undefined behavior. Without this initialization, the program will fail for any input, making it incorrect.
