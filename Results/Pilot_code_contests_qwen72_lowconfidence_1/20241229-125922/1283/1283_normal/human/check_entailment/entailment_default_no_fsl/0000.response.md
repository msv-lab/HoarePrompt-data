Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically:

1. **Initialization of `dp1` and `dp2`**: The function `func_2` assumes that `dp1` and `dp2` are correctly initialized to -1, but this is not checked within the function. If `dp1` or `dp2` are not initialized properly, the function may produce incorrect results or encounter runtime errors.

2. **Handling of `black_cost` and `white_cost` lengths**: The function `func_2` does not handle cases where the `black_cost` or `white_cost` lists are shorter than `m`. This could lead to out-of-bounds errors if the lists are not of the expected length.

3. **Edge Case for Minimum Width Constraint**: The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where the minimum width constraint `x` is not met. For example, if `x` is 3 and the current segment length is 2, the function may incorrectly attempt to extend the segment without ensuring that the total segment length meets the minimum requirement.

4. **Recursive Termination**: The termination condition for the recursion in `func_2` may not handle all edge cases correctly, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect results.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
