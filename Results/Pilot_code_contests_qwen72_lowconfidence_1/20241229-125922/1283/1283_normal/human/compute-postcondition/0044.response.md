The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `cb`. The previous value of `b` is an integer representing the current width of black segments, and this value is now also assigned to `cb`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is 0, `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is equal to `b`.
