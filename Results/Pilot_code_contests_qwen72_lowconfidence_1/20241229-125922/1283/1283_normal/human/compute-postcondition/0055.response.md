The code snippet sets the variable `c2` to `float('inf')`.

- Before this code, `c2` was `float('inf') + black_cost[index]`.
- After executing `c2 = float('inf')`, `c2` is now `float('inf')`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf'), `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is `index + 1`. If `i` equals `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
