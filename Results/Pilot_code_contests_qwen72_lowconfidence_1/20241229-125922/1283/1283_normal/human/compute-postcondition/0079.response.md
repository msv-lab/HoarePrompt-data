Output State: **The program returns the minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. `c1` and `c2` are the current values stored in `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`, respectively. `c3` and `c4` are updated if their respective conditions are met, otherwise they retain their previous values or are set to a default value (if not previously defined).**
