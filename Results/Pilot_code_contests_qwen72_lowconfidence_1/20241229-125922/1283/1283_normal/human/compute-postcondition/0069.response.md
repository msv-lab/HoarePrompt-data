The given code snippet modifies the value of `c2` by adding the result of the function `func_2` to it. The function `func_2` is called with several arguments, including the updated values of `i` and `cb`.

Given the initial state:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000.
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m.
- `index` is an integer starting from 0.
- `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively.
- `index` is less than `m`.
- Either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both).
- `c1` is float('inf').
- `c2` is float('inf') + the sum of `black_cost[index + k]` for `k` from 0 to `min(x - b, m - index) - 1`.
- `c3` is float('inf').
- `c4` is float('inf').
- `b` is less than `x`.
- `cb` is `b + min(x - b, m - index)`.
- `i` is `index + min(x - b, m - index)`.
- If `i` equals `m`, `c2` is float('inf').

The code snippet:
```python
c2 += func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, 0, cb)
```

Impact:
- The value of `c2` is updated by adding the result of `func_2` to it.
- The arguments passed to `func_2` are:
  - `dp1` and `dp2`: 2D lists initialized to -1.
  - `matrix`: 2D list of characters.
  - `n` and `m`: Dimensions of the matrix.
  - `x` and `y`: Positive integers.
  - `black_cost` and `white_cost`: Lists of integers.
  - `i`: Updated value of `index + min(x - b, m - index)`.
  - `0`: Initial width of the segment.
  - `cb`: Updated value of `b + min(x - b, m - index)`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we assume it returns a value that is added to `c2`.
