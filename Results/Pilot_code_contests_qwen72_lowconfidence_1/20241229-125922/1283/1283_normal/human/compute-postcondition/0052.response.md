The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially equal to `index`, after the increment, `i` will be `index + 1`. The condition `if i equals m, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement` remains unchanged and should be evaluated in the context of the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf') + `black_cost[index]`, `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is equal to `b`, `i` is `index + 1`. If `i` equals `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
