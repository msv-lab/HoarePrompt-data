The given code snippet updates the variable `c3` by adding the cost of the white segment at the current index to the result of the function `func_2` with specific parameters.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1.
   - `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#').
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
   - `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000.
   - `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length `m`.
   - `index` is an integer starting from 0.
   - `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively.
   - `index` is less than `m`.
   - Either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both).
   - `b < x` and `w >= x` and `w + 1 <= y`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet updates `c3` with the value `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `c3` is assigned the value of `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#'), `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length `m`, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `b < x`, `w >= x`, `w + 1 <= y`, `c3` is `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`**
