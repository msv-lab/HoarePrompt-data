Postcondition: ***`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#'), `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 â‰¤ x â‰¤ y â‰¤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length `m`, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both). If `b >= x` and `b + 1 <= y`, then `c4` is updated to `black_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, 0, b + 1)`. Additionally, if `w >= x` and `w + 1 <= y`, `c3` is updated to `white_cost[index] + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, index + 1, w + 1, 0)`. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
