The code snippet `c2 += black_cost[i]` updates the value of `c2` by adding `black_cost[i]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `c2` was initially `float('inf') + black_cost[index]`.
- `i` is `index + 1`.
- `black_cost[i]` is added to `c2`.

Therefore, the new value of `c2` is `float('inf') + black_cost[index] + black_cost[index + 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so their values stay the same.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf') + `black_cost[index]` + `black_cost[index + 1]`, `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is `index + 1`. If `i` equals `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
