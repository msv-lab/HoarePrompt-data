The given code snippet updates the value of `c1` by adding the result of the function call `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)` to its current value.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `c1` is updated to `c1 + func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`.
- All other variables (`dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `black_cost`, `white_cost`, `index`, `w`, `b`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `cw`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact value of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific new value of `c1`. However, we know that `c1` is updated to include the result of this function call.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `min(index + x - w, m) - 1` plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `c2` is float('inf'), `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `w` is less than `x`, `cw` is equal to `min(x, w + (m - index))`, `i` is equal to `min(m, index + (x - w))`. If `i` is equal to `m`, the loop breaks.**
