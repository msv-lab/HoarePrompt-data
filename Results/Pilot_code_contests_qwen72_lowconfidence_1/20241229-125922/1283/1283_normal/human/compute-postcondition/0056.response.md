The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block. In this context, the values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is altered.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf'), `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is `b + 1`, `i` is `index + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
