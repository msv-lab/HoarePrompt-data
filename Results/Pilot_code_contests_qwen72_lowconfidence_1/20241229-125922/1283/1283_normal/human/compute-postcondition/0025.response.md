The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from `index` to `index + 1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is `white_cost[i-1]`, `c2` is float('inf'), `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `w` is less than `x`, `cw` is equal to `w`, `i` is equal to `index + 1`. If `i` is equal to `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
