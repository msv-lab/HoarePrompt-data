Functionality: ** The function `func_2` is designed to compute the minimum cost of segmenting a 2D matrix into white and black segments, given certain constraints. The function takes several parameters: `dp1` and `dp2` (2D lists initialized to -1), `matrix` (a 2D list of characters representing the image), `n` and `m` (dimensions of the matrix), `x` and `y` (integers defining the segment width constraints), `black_cost` and `white_cost` (lists of integers representing the cost of making a segment black or white), `index` (the current position in the matrix), and `w` and `b` (current widths of white and black segments, respectively).

The function returns:
1. **0** if the current index is greater than or equal to `m` and either:
   - The current width of the white segment (`w`) is non-zero and at least `x`.
   - The current width of the black segment (`b`) is non-zero and at least `x`.
2. **Infinity (float('inf'))** if the current index is greater than or equal to `m` and neither `w` nor `b` meet the above conditions.
3. **The minimum value between `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`** if both `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]` are not -1 and `index` is less than `m`.
4. **The minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`** if none of the above conditions are met. Here, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` represent the costs of different segmentation scenarios:
   - `c1` is the cost of extending the white segment to at least `x` width.
   - `c2` is the cost of extending the black segment to at least `x` width.
   - `c3` is the cost of extending the white segment by one more cell, if possible.
   - `c4` is the cost of extending the black segment by one more cell, if possible.

The function updates the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays with the computed minimum costs for future reference, which helps in avoiding redundant calculations (dynamic programming). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function returns the minimum cost of segmenting the matrix according to the given constraints. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case 1:** If `m` is 0, the function will immediately return `float('inf')` because the index will always be greater than or equal to `m`.
- **Edge Case 2:** If `x` is greater than `m`, the function will also return `float('inf')` because it's impossible to have a segment of width `x` when the total width `m` is less than `x`.
- **Edge Case 3:** If `w` or `b` are negative, the function should handle this gracefully, but the code does not explicitly check for negative values. This could lead to unexpected behavior if negative values are passed.
- **Edge Case 4:** If `x` is greater than `y`, the conditions for extending segments by one more cell (`c3` and `c4`) will never be met, potentially leading to suboptimal results.
- **Missing Functionality:** The function does not handle cases where the `black_cost` or `white_cost` lists are shorter than `m`, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors. Additionally, the function assumes that `dp1` and `dp2` are correctly initialized to -1, but this is not checked within the function. **
