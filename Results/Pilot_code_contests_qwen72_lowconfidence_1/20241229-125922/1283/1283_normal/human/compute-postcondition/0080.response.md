The function `func_2` accepts several parameters: `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length `m`, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: 0
- **Case_2**: 0
- **Case_3**: Infinity (float('inf'))
- **Case_4**: The minimum value between `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`, where `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]` are integers and not -1, `w` and `b` are the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, and `index` is an integer less than `m`.
- **Case_5**: The minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. `c1` and `c2` are the current values stored in `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]`, respectively. `c3` and `c4` are updated if their respective conditions are met, otherwise they retain their previous values or are set to a default value (if not previously defined).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `dp1`, `dp2`, `matrix`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `black_cost`, `white_cost`, `index`, `w`, and `b`. It returns 0 in two cases, infinity in one case, the minimum value between `dp1[w][index]` and `dp2[b][index]` in another case, and the minimum value among `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` in the last case.**
