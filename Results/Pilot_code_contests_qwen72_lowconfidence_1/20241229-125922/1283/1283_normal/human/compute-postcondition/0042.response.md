Postcondition: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf'), `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'). If `w < x`, `c1` is updated to the sum of `white_cost` from `index` to `min(index + x - w, m) - 1` plus the result of `func_2(dp1, dp2, matrix, n, m, x, y, black_cost, white_cost, i, cw, 0)`, `cw` is equal to `min(x, w + (m - index))`, and `i` is equal to `min(m, index + (x - w))`. If `i` is equal to `m`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged. Additionally, `b` is less than `x`.**
