The code snippet `c2 += black_cost[i]` updates the value of `c2` by adding the value at the index `i` of the `black_cost` list to `c2`.

Given the initial state:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1.
- `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image.
- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix.
- `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000.
- `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m.
- `index` is an integer starting from 0.
- `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively.
- `index` is less than `m`.
- Either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both).
- `c1` is float('inf').
- `c2` is float('inf').
- `c3` is float('inf').
- `c4` is float('inf').
- `b` is less than `x`.
- `cb` is equal to `b`.
- `i` is equal to `index`.
- If `i` equals `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code snippet:
- `c2` is updated to `float('inf') + black_cost[i]`.

Since `i` is equal to `index` and `index` is less than `m`, the value of `black_cost[i]` is a valid integer from the `black_cost` list.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are 2D lists initialized to -1, `matrix` is a 2D list of characters ('.' or '#') representing the image, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of the matrix, `x` and `y` are positive integers where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 1000, `black_cost` and `white_cost` are lists of integers of length m, `index` is an integer starting from 0, `w` and `b` are integers representing the current widths of white and black segments, respectively, `index` is less than `m`, either `dp1[w][index] == -1` or `dp2[b][index] == -1` (or both), `c1` is float('inf'), `c2` is float('inf') + `black_cost[index]`, `c3` is float('inf'), `c4` is float('inf'), `b` is less than `x`, `cb` is equal to `b`, `i` is equal to `index`. If `i` equals `m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
