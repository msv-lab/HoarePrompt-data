#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a value, which is then converted to an integer and returned. If the user enters a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program is that an integer value entered by the user is returned, or an error is raised if the input is invalid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a float value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a float value input by the user. If the user inputs a non-numeric value, a `ValueError` will be raised. After the function concludes, the program state will include the returned float value, which can be used by the calling context.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the input provided by the user. If the user does not provide any input and simply presses Enter, the function returns an empty string. The function does not perform any additional processing or validation on the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object which applies the `str` function to each element from the input split by spaces. The input is not defined in the initial state, so the exact elements of the map object depend on the user's input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by whitespace into multiple substrings, and returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each of these substrings. The returned map object can be iterated over to access the individual string elements. If no input is provided, the function will return a map object that, when iterated over, will yield no elements. If the input contains only whitespace, the function will also return a map object that, when iterated over, will yield no elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_5():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers read from a line of space-separated input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting a line of space-separated integers. It converts each string in the input into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input (e.g., non-integer values) or empty input. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty map object.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature. This function does not take any arguments and does not seem to contribute directly to solving the given problem.
def func_6():
    return list(func_5())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling the function `func_5()`. The content of the list depends on the implementation of `func_5()`, which is not provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by calling the function `func_5()`. The content of the list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_5()`, which is not provided. If `func_5()` raises an exception or returns a non-iterable type, `func_6` will also raise an exception. If `func_5()` returns an iterable, `func_6` will convert it into a list and return it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. This function appears to set up input and output redirection and does not contribute to the core logic of solving the patty-cake problem.
def func_7():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets up input and output redirection by opening the file `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing. After the function executes, `sys.stdin` will be redirected to read from `input.txt`, and `sys.stdout` will be redirected to write to `output.txt`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could lead to runtime errors if these files are not present or cannot be opened.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_8(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0, and the original value of `y` was greater than 0.
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, where the original value of `y` was greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x` as the GCD. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers.
def func_9(x, y):
    return x * y // func_8(x, y)
    #The program returns the integer division result of (x * y) by the value returned from func_8(x, y), where x and y are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both expected to be positive integers. It returns the integer division result of `(x * y)` by the value returned from another function `func_8(x, y)`. If `func_8(x, y)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. If `func_8(x, y)` returns a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and could lead to a `TypeError`. The final state of the program is that the function returns an integer result, or an error is raised if the division cannot be performed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b and m are integers such that m > 1 and b is a positive integer.
def func_10(b, m):
    g = func_8(b, m)
    if (g != 1) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    else :
        return pow(b, m - 2, m)
        #The program returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`, where `b` is a positive integer and `m` is an integer such that `m > 1`. The value of `g` is 1, but it does not affect the return value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts two parameters `b` and `m`, where `b` is a positive integer and `m` is an integer greater than 1. The function first calls `func_8(b, m)` and stores the result in `g`. If `g` is not equal to 1, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the result of `pow(b, m - 2, m)`. The final state of the program is that the function either returns -1 or the modular exponentiation result of `b^(m-2) % m`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, m is a positive integer.
def func_11(a, b, m):
    a = a % m
    inv = func_10(b, m)
    if (inv == -1) :
        return -999999999
        #The program returns -999999999
    else :
        return inv * a % m
        #The program returns the result of `(inv * a) % m`, where `a` is `a % m`, `b` is an integer, `m` is a positive integer, `inv` is the result of `func_10(b, m)`, and `inv` is not equal to -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` takes three parameters: `a` (an integer), `b` (an integer), and `m` (a positive integer). It first computes `a % m` and then calls another function `func_10(b, m)`, which is expected to return an inverse value `inv`. If `func_10` returns `-1`, indicating that the inverse could not be computed, `func_11` returns `-999999999`. Otherwise, it returns the result of `(inv * a) % m`, where `a` is the result of `a % m` and `inv` is the valid result from `func_10`. The function ensures that the final result is always within the range `[0, m-1]` when the inverse exists. Edge cases include scenarios where `func_10` fails to compute an inverse, in which case `-999999999` is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to `func_12()`. It internally uses `func_1()` to get the number of test cases `T` and the number of patty-cakes `n` for each test case, and `func_6()` to get the list of integers representing the patty-cakes' fillings `a` for each test case.
def func_12():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        
        a = func_6()
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        f = [0] * 100005
        
        for i in range(n):
            f[a[i]] += 1
        
        s = 0
        
        s = max(f)
        
        if s == n:
            func_13(0)
            continue
        
        if f.count(1) == n - s:
            if s == 2:
                ans = n - s
            else:
                ans = (n - 1) // (s + 1)
                ans += 1
            func_13(ans)
            continue
        
        ans = (n - 1) // (s + 1)
        
        ans += 1
        
        func_13(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `func_1()` returns a non-negative integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of patty-cakes, and `a` is a list of integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, sorted in descending order. The list `f` is a list of 100,005 elements initialized to 0, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `s` is the maximum value in `f`. If `s` equals `n`, `func_13(0)` is called. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` is called. After all iterations, the loop has processed `T` test cases, and `func_13` has been called with the appropriate `ans` value for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it retrieves the number of patty-cakes `n` and a list of their fillings `a`. It then sorts the fillings in descending order and counts the frequency of each filling using a list `f`. The function determines the maximum frequency `s` of any filling. Based on the values of `s` and `n`, it calculates a result `ans` and calls `func_13` with this result. Specifically, if all fillings are unique (`s == n`), `func_13(0)` is called. If the most frequent filling appears only once more than the others (`f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`), `ans` is set to `n - s`. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. After processing all `T` test cases, `func_13` is called with the appropriate `ans` value for each test case. The function does not return any value directly; its primary effect is calling `func_13` with the computed results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary containing optional keyword arguments such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values, 'file' is a stream object to which the values will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_13():

        if not at_start:

        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains True, and the string representations of all elements in `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))

The string representations of all elements in `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`. The newline character or the value of `'end'` has been written to `file`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer of `file` has been flushed. `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, and `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space). After writing all the elements, it appends a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the stream's buffer is flushed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include: if `args` is empty, no elements are written, but the `end` character is still appended; if `file` is not writable, a runtime error may occur; if `flush` is `True` but `file` does not support flushing, a runtime error may also occur.
