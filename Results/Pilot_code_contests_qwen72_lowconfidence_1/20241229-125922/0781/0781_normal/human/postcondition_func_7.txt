The function `func_8` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. If `y` is 0, the function returns `x` as the GCD. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0.
