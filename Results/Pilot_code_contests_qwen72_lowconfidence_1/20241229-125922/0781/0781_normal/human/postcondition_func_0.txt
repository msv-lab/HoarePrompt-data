The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter a value, which is then converted to an integer and returned. If the user enters a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The final state of the program is that an integer value entered by the user is returned, or an error is raised if the input is invalid.
