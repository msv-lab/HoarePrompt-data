The function `read` is intended to process input data, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer T representing the number of bags (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), followed by T test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) indicating the number of patty-cakes, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the fillings of the patty-cakes. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling, and the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.
