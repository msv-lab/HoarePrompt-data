To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the provided information:

- `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional keyword arguments such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (with 'sep' and 'file' removed).
- `sep` is a string used to separate the values (set to ' ' if not specified in kwargs).
- `file` is a stream object to which the values will be written (set to `sys.stdout` if not specified in kwargs).
- `'end'` is a string appended after the last value.
- `'flush'` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is True.

The loop `for x in args:` will execute if `args` is not an empty tuple. If `args` is empty, the loop will not run even once.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`args`**: The loop will only execute if `args` contains at least one element.
2. **`kwargs`**: This dictionary should be valid and contain the necessary keys and values, but it does not directly affect the loop's execution.
3. **`sep`**: This should be set to a default value if not specified in `kwargs`.
4. **`file`**: This should be set to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`.
5. **`end`**: This should be a valid string.
6. **`flush`**: This should be a valid boolean.
7. **`at_start`**: This is a boolean that is True, but it does not directly affect the loop's execution.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `args` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, and `at_start`) should be in a valid state, but they do not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one value, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is True**
