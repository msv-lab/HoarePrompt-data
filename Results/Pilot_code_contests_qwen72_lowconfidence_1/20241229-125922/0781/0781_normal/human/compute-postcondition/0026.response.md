The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically be invalid in this context. However, since the task is to simulate the execution, we will assume the presence of a loop that contains this statement.

Given that `continue` does not change any variable values directly, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that we indicate the loop behavior:

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f` (at least 1), the number of occurrences of 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`. If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. `func_13(ans)` has been executed. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
