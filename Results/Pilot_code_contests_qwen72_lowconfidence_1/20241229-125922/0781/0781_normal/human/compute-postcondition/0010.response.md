The value of `sep` is written to `file`. The variables `args`, `kwargs`, `end`, `flush`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. The string representation of the next `x` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least two values, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is False, and the string representation of the next `x` is written to `file` after `sep` has been written.**
