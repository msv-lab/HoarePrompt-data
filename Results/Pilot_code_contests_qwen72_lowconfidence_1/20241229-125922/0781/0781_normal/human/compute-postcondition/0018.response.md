Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one value, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `str(x)` has been written to `file`.** 

Note: Since the code snippet only reassigns `at_start` to `False`, which was already its value in the initial state, no changes occur to the state.
