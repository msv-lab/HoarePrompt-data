The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end early, skipping any remaining code in the loop body and moving directly to the next iteration. Since no actual computation or assignment is performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is equal to `n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` and `func_13(0)` have been executed.**
