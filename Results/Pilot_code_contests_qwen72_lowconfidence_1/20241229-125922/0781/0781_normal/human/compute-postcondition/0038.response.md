To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a value greater than 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list in descending order.
   - `f` is a list of 100005 elements with `f[a[0]]` set to 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is 1.
   - `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the condition `i < n` will still hold true if `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is a value greater than 1, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements with `f[a[0]]` now set to 1, `i` is 1, `s` is 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
