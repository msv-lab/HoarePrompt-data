The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by performing an integer division of `(n - 1)` by `(s + 1)`. The previous value of `ans` was `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, but now it is updated to `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1)`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` is also executed. Additionally, the number of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is exactly `n - s`. `s` is not equal to 2.**
