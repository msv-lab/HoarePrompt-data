Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space). After writing all the elements, it appends a specified end character (defaulting to a newline). If the `flush` keyword argument is set to `True`, the stream's buffer is flushed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include: if `args` is empty, no elements are written, but the `end` character is still appended; if `file` is not writable, a runtime error may occur; if `flush` is `True` but `file` does not support flushing, a runtime error may also occur. **
