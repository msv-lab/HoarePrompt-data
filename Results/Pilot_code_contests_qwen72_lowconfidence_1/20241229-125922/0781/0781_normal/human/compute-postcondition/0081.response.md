Postcondition: ***`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Additionally, the number of occurrences of 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`. The current value of `s` is 2.***
