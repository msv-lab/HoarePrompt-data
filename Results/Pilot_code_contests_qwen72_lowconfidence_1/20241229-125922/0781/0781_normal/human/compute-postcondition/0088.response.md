The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the control flow moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, the number of occurrences of 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
