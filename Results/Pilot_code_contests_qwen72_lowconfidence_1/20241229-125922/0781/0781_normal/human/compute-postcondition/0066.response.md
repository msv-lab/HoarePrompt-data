The line of code `f = [0] * 100005` initializes `f` as a list containing 100,005 zeros. This overwrites the previous value of `f`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 zeros, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
