Functionality: ** The function `func_12` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it retrieves the number of patty-cakes `n` and a list of their fillings `a`. It then sorts the fillings in descending order and counts the frequency of each filling using a list `f`. The function determines the maximum frequency `s` of any filling. Based on the values of `s` and `n`, it calculates a result `ans` and calls `func_13` with this result. Specifically, if all fillings are unique (`s == n`), `func_13(0)` is called. If the most frequent filling appears only once more than the others (`f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`), `ans` is set to `n - s`. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. After processing all `T` test cases, `func_13` is called with the appropriate `ans` value for each test case. The function does not return any value directly; its primary effect is calling `func_13` with the computed results. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `n` is 0, the function will still proceed to sort an empty list `a` and initialize `f` to a list of 100,005 zeros. The maximum frequency `s` will be 0, and `func_13(0)` will be called.
- If all fillings are the same (`s == n`), the function correctly calls `func_13(0)`.
- If the most frequent filling appears exactly twice and all other fillings are unique (`s == 2` and `f.count(1) == n - s`), the function correctly sets `ans` to `n - s`.
- For other cases, the function calculates `ans` as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1` and calls `func_13(ans)`.
- The function assumes that `func_1()` and `func_6()` return valid inputs and handles them accordingly. Any invalid input (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer values) could cause unexpected behavior.
