Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f` (which is the frequency of the most frequent element in `a`), `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
