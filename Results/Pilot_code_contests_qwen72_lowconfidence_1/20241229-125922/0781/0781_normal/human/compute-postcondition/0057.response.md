The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this is part of a loop. However, the `continue` statement itself does not alter the values of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with no changes to the variables. The only difference is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, the number of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is exactly `n - s`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - s`. If `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // (s + 1)) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed.**
