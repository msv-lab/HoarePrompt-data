To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given State:
- `n` is a value greater than 0 (returned by `func_1()`).
- `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order.
- `f` is a list of 100005 elements all set to 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the maximum value in `f` (which is now 0).
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.
- `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is already satisfied because `n` is given as a value greater than 0.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n-1`. However, the initial state provided sets `i` to `n-1`. This needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute correctly.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`a`, `f`, `s`, `ans`) do not directly affect the loop condition, but they should be mentioned in the state to provide a complete picture.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a value greater than 0 (returned by `func_1()`).
- `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order.
- `f` is a list of 100005 elements all set to 0.
- `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop).
- `s` is the maximum value in `f` (which is now 0).
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.
- `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements all set to 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the maximum value in `f` (which is now 0), `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
