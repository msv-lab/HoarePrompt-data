To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

### Given State:
- `n` is a value greater than 0.
- `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0.
- `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order.
- `f` is a list of 100005 elements where `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the maximum value in `f` (at least 1).
- `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.
- `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(func_1()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0. The loop does not depend on any other variables or indices; it only depends on the return value of `func_1()`.

### Analysis:
- Since the loop condition is solely based on the return value of `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `func_1()` still returns a value greater than 0 for the next iteration.
- The state of other variables (`n`, `a`, `f`, `i`, `s`, `ans`) does not affect the loop condition directly.

### Adjusted State:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_1()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must still return a value greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f` (at least 1), `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
