The value of `n` is updated to the value returned by `func_1()`, which is a value greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0 (returned by `func_1()`), `func_1()` must return a value greater than 0, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f` (at least 1), `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
