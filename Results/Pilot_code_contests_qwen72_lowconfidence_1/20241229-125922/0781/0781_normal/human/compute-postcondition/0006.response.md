Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least one value, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, and `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, `sep` is written to `file`, and `at_start` remains False.***
