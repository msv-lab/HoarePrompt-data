The given code snippet calls the function `func_13(ans)`. Based on the initial state:

- `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`.
- `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the maximum value in `f`.
- The number of occurrences of 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`.
- If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - 2`, and `func_13(ans)` has been executed.
- If `s` is not 2, `ans` is `((n - 1) // (s + 1)) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` has been executed.
- If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

Given the conditions, the value of `ans` has already been determined based on the value of `s`. The call to `func_13(ans)` does not affect the values of the variables in the initial state. However, the function `func_13(ans)` has been executed with the value of `ans` as determined by the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, the number of occurrences of 1 in `f` is equal to `n - s`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
