Output State: **`func_1()` returns a non-negative integer `T` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of patty-cakes, and `a` is a list of integers representing the fillings of the patty-cakes, sorted in descending order. The list `f` is a list of 100,005 elements initialized to 0, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `f[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `s` is the maximum value in `f`. If `s` equals `n`, `func_13(0)` is called. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` is called. After all iterations, the loop has processed `T` test cases, and `func_13` has been called with the appropriate `ans` value for each test case.**
