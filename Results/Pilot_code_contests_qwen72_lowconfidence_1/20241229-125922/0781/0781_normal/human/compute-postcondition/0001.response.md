The code snippet updates the values of `sep` and `file` based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'sep' is not in `kwargs`, `sep` is set to a space (' '). If 'file' is not in `kwargs`, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`. The entries 'sep' and 'file' are removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, kwargs is a dictionary containing optional keyword arguments such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (with 'sep' and 'file' removed), sep is a string used to separate the values (set to ' ' if not specified in kwargs), file is a stream object to which the values will be written (set to sys.stdout if not specified in kwargs), 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.**
