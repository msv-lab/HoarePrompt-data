To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`.
- `f[a[0]]` is 1.
- `f` is a list of 100,005 elements with the element at index `a[0]` incremented by 1.
- `s` is 1.
- `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.
- `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`a`, `f`, `s`, `ans`, and the execution of `func_13(ans)`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i` or the condition of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f[a[0]]` is 1, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements with the element at index `a[0]` incremented by 1, `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
