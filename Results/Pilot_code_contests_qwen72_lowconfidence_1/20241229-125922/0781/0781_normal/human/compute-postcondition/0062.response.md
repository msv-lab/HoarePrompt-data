To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a value greater than 0.
- `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`.
- `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is 1.
- `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.
- `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(func_1()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute based on the value returned by `func_1()`.
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable, meaning it does not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop variable `_` is a dummy variable, the only thing that affects the loop's execution is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- The state of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `f`, `i`, `s`, `ans`) does not change between iterations of the loop because the loop body is omitted.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as many times as `func_1()` returns. Since the loop body is omitted, no modifications to the state are required for the loop to execute one more time. However, if we need to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, it remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
