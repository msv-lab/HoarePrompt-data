The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, and `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`. If `f.count(1) == n - s`, the number of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is exactly `n - s`. If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - s`. If `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // (s + 1)) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed.**
