Postcondition: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed, and `s` is equal to `n`.**
