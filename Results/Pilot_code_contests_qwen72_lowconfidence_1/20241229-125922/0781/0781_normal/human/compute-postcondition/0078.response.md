The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop explicitly shown in the code snippet, it is implied that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop context.

Given that no changes to variables are made by the `continue` statement itself, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(0)` has been executed, and the maximum value in `f` (`s`) is equal to `n`. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
