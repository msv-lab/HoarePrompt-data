The code `func_13(ans)` is executed, which means the function `func_13` is called with the argument `ans`. Based on the initial state, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`.

Since the function call does not modify any of the variables directly in the given context, the values of `n`, `a`, `f`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. However, the function call itself is part of the state, indicating that `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100,005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in `range(n)`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is the maximum value in `f`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `f.count(1) == n - s`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
