The function `func_13(0)` is called with the argument `0`. This does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `f`, `i`, `s`, or `ans`, which remain unchanged from their initial state. However, the execution of `func_13(0)` indicates that this function is called again, this time with `0` as its argument. Since the initial call to `func_13(ans)` has already occurred, the second call does not change the fact that `func_13` has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is equal to `n`, `ans` is `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` and `func_13(0)` have been executed.**
