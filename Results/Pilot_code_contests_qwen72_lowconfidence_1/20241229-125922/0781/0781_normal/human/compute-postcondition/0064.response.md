The line of code `a = func_6()` reassigns the variable `a`. According to the initial state, `a` was already a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`. Since this function is called again, `a` is reassigned to a new list that is also sorted in descending order, but the contents of this list are unknown without knowing the specifics of `func_6()`. However, the problem does not specify changes in the behavior of `func_6()`, so we assume it returns a list sorted in descending order, possibly different from the previous call.

The other variables (`n`, `f`, `i`, `s`, `ans`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
