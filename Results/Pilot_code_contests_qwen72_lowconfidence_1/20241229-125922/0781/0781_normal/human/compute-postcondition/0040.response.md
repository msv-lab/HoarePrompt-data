To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a value greater than 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list in descending order, returned by `func_6()`.
   - `f` is a list of 100005 elements where `f[a[0]]` and `f[a[1]]` are set to 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is 1.
   - `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - `func_13(ans)` has been executed.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, incrementing `i` by 1 will make `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a value greater than 2, `a` is the value returned by `func_6()` and is now sorted in descending order, `f` is a list of 100005 elements with `f[a[0]]` now set to 1 and `f[a[1]]` set to 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 1, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
