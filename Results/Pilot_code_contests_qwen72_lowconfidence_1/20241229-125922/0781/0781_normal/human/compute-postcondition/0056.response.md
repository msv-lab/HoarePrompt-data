The function `func_13(ans)` is called, which implies that the value of `ans` is passed to this function. Based on the conditions provided:

- If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - s`.
- If `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // (s + 1)) + 1`.
- If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` is executed.

Since the call to `func_13(ans)` is made, it means that `ans` is determined based on the value of `s` as described above. However, the exact value of `s` is not provided, so we cannot determine a specific value for `ans` without knowing `s`. Nevertheless, the function `func_13(ans)` is executed, and its impact on the state is not specified (e.g., whether it returns a value, modifies global variables, etc.).

Given the information provided, the only change in the state is that `func_13(ans)` has been executed. The values of `n`, `a`, `f`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is used as an argument for `func_13`, but its value depends on the value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a value greater than 0, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, the number of elements in `f` that are equal to 1 is exactly `n - s`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is 2, `ans` is `n - s`. If `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // (s + 1)) + 1`, and `func_13(ans)` has been executed. If `s` is equal to `n`, `func_13(0)` has been executed.**
