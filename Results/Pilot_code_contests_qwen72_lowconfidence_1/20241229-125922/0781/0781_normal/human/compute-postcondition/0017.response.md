The value of `x`, which is the next element in `args`, is converted to a string and written to the `file` stream. The state of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` remains unchanged. The value of `at_start` is still False, and since no operation changes it, it remains False. 

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one value, `kwargs` is a dictionary, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is False, `x` is the next element in `args`, and `str(x)` has been written to `file`.**
