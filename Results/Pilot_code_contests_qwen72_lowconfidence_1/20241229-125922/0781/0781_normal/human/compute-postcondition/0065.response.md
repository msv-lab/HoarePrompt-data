The line of code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. Since `a` was already a list sorted in descending order, calling `a.sort(reverse=True)` does not change the order of the elements in `a`.

The other variables (`n`, `f`, `i`, `s`, `ans`) are not affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `a` is a list sorted in descending order, returned by `func_6()`, `f` is a list of 100005 elements where each element at index `a[i]` (for `i` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 1, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `func_13(ans)` has been executed.**
