The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses `func_1` to determine the number of test cases `T` and the number of patty-cakes `n` for each test case. Additionally, it uses `func_6` to obtain a list of integers `a` representing the fillings of the patty-cakes for each test case. The function processes this data and returns the results based on the internal logic applied to `T`, `n`, and `a`.
