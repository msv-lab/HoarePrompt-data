Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary with `'end'` removed if it was present, `sep` is a string (default ' ' if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a stream object (default `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains True, and the string representations of all elements in `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`. The newline character or the value of `'end'` has been written to `file`. Additionally, the current value of `flush` is `True`.***
