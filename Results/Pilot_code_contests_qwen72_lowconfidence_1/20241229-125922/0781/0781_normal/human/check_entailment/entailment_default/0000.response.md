Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_12` does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling is flawed in certain scenarios.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling All Unique Fillings**:
   - The code checks if all fillings are unique (`s == n`) and prints `0` in this case. This is correct because if all fillings are unique, the minimum distance between any two patty-cakes with the same filling is `0`.

2. **Handling the Case Where the Most Frequent Filling Appears Only Once More Than the Others**:
   - The code checks if the most frequent filling appears only once more than the others (`f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`). In this case, it sets `ans` to `n - s`. This logic is incorrect. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     2 2 1 1
     ```
     Here, `s = 2` and `n = 4`, but the correct answer should be `1` (the minimum distance between the two `2`s or the two `1`s is `1`), not `2`.

3. **General Case**:
   - The general case logic is:
     ```python
     ans = (n - 1) // (s + 1)
     ans += 1
     ```
   - This logic is generally correct for most cases, but it fails in edge cases where the distribution of fillings is not uniform. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     5
     1 1 1 2 2
     ```
     Here, `s = 3` and `n = 5`. The correct answer should be `2` (the minimum distance between the two `2`s is `2`), but the code calculates `ans` as `2` which is correct in this specific case. However, the logic should be more robust to handle all edge cases.

To summarize, the function `func_12` does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when the most frequent filling appears only once more than the others. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
