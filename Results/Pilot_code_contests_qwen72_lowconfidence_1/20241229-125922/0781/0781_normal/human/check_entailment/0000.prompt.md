You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pinkie Pie has bought a bag of patty-cakes with different fillings! But it appeared that not all patty-cakes differ from one another with filling. In other words, the bag contains some patty-cakes with the same filling.

Pinkie Pie eats the patty-cakes one-by-one. She likes having fun so she decided not to simply eat the patty-cakes but to try not to eat the patty-cakes with the same filling way too often. To achieve this she wants the minimum distance between the eaten with the same filling to be the largest possible. Herein Pinkie Pie called the distance between two patty-cakes the number of eaten patty-cakes strictly between them.

Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in any order. She is impatient about eating all the patty-cakes up so she asks you to help her to count the greatest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating!

Pinkie Pie is going to buy more bags of patty-cakes so she asks you to solve this problem for several bags!

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100): the number of bags for which you need to solve the problem.

The first line of each bag description contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5): the number of patty-cakes in it. The second line of the bag description contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n): the information of patty-cakes' fillings: same fillings are defined as same integers, different fillings are defined as different integers. It is guaranteed that each bag contains at least two patty-cakes with the same filling. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all bags does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each bag print in separate line one single integer: the largest minimum distance between the eaten patty-cakes with the same filling amongst all possible orders of eating for that bag.

Example

Input


4
7
1 7 1 6 4 4 6
8
1 1 4 6 4 6 4 7
3
3 3 3
6
2 5 2 3 1 4


Output


3
2
0
4

Note

For the first bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 6, 4, 7, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 3).

For the second bag Pinkie Pie can eat the patty-cakes in the following order (by fillings): 1, 4, 6, 7, 4, 1, 6, 4 (in this way, the minimum distance is equal to 2).

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
