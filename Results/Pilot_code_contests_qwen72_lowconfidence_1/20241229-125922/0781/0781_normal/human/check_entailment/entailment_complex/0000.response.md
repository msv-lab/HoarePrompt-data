Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a logical issue that causes it to produce incorrect results for certain cases. Specifically, the sorting of the patty-cakes' fillings in descending order (`a.sort(reverse=True)`) is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the minimum distance between patty-cakes with the same filling.
- The distance is defined as the number of patty-cakes strictly between two patty-cakes with the same filling.

### Issue in the Code:
- **Sorting the Fillings**: The code sorts the fillings in descending order before counting the frequencies. This step is not necessary and can alter the order of the fillings, potentially leading to incorrect results.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 1 2
```
- The expected output is `2` because the optimal order to eat the patty-cakes to maximize the minimum distance is `1, 2, 3, 1, 2`, where the minimum distance between the same fillings is `2`.

However, the provided code sorts the fillings in descending order, which changes the input to `3, 2, 2, 1, 1`. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the frequencies and the resulting minimum distance.

### Correct Approach:
- The fillings should be counted without sorting.
- The maximum frequency of any filling should be determined.
- The result should be calculated based on the maximum frequency and the total number of patty-cakes.

### Corrected Code:
Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_12():
    for _ in range(func_1()):
        n = func_1()
        a = func_6()
        
        f = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            f[a[i]] += 1
        
        s = max(f)
        
        if s == n:
            func_13(0)
            continue
        
        ans = (n - 1) // (s - 1)
        
        func_13(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the unnecessary sorting of the fillings. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
