Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program appears to be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each case individually, which aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calculates the frequency of each patty-cake filling using the `f` array. This step is necessary to determine the most frequent filling, which is crucial for calculating the maximum minimum distance.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all patty-cakes have the same filling (`s == n`), the program correctly outputs `0` because the minimum distance between the same fillings would be zero.
   - For the case where the most frequent filling appears only twice and all other fillings appear once (`f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`), the program correctly outputs `n - s`, which is the maximum possible distance.
   - For other cases, the program calculates the maximum minimum distance using the formula `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`, which ensures the largest minimum distance between the same fillings.

4. **Output**: The program uses the `func_13` function to print the results, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all specified cases and edge conditions correctly. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
