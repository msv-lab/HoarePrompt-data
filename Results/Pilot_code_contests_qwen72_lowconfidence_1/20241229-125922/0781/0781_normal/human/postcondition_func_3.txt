The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by whitespace into multiple substrings, and returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each of these substrings. The returned map object can be iterated over to access the individual string elements. If no input is provided, the function will return a map object that, when iterated over, will yield no elements. If the input contains only whitespace, the function will also return a map object that, when iterated over, will yield no elements.
