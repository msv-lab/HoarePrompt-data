The function `func_12` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it retrieves the number of patty-cakes `n` and a list of their fillings `a`. It then sorts the fillings in descending order and counts the frequency of each filling using a list `f`. The function determines the maximum frequency `s` of any filling. Based on the values of `s` and `n`, it calculates a result `ans` and calls `func_13` with this result. Specifically, if all fillings are unique (`s == n`), `func_13(0)` is called. If the most frequent filling appears only once more than the others (`f.count(1) == n - s` and `s == 2`), `ans` is set to `n - s`. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) // (s + 1) + 1`. After processing all `T` test cases, `func_13` is called with the appropriate `ans` value for each test case. The function does not return any value directly; its primary effect is calling `func_13` with the computed results.
