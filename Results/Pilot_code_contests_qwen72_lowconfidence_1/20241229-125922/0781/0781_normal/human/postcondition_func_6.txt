The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets up input and output redirection by opening the file `input.txt` for reading and `output.txt` for writing. After the function executes, `sys.stdin` will be redirected to read from `input.txt`, and `sys.stdout` will be redirected to write to `output.txt`. The function does not handle any potential exceptions, such as the files not existing or being inaccessible, which could lead to runtime errors if these files are not present or cannot be opened.
