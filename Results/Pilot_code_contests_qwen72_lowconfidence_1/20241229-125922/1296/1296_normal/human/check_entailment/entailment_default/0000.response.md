Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from fully conforming to the problem description for every potential case. Here are the key issues:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the case where the input list `hLst` has only one element. According to the problem description, if the list has only one element, the difference between the highest and lowest books is zero, which should be within any valid `k`. However, the code might not correctly handle this case.

2. **Initial Break Condition**: The initial `while` loop that increments `j` to find the first valid subarray breaks too early if the difference between the maximum and minimum values exceeds `k`. This can lead to missing valid subarrays.

3. **Heap Management**: The code uses two heaps to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the current subarray. However, the way the heaps are managed can lead to inefficiencies and potential logical errors. Specifically, the code does not properly update the heaps when the window is adjusted, which can result in incorrect values being used for `m` and `M`.

4. **Subarray Length Calculation**: The code calculates the length of the subarray as `j - i`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray length is zero. This can lead to incorrect results when the subarray length is very small.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 0\n10`
- Expected Output: `1 1\n1 1`
- Actual Output: The code might not correctly handle this case and could potentially output an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
