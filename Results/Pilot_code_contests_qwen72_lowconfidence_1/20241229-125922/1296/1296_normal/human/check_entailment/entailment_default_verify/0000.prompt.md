You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are several days left before the fiftieth birthday of a famous Berland's writer Berlbury. In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than k millimeters.

The library has n volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is hi. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.

Input

The first line of the input data contains two integer numbers separated by a space n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 106) — the amount of books by Berlbury in the library, and the maximum allowed height difference between the lowest and the highest books. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by a space. Each number hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 106) is the height of the i-th book in millimeters.

Output

In the first line of the output data print two numbers a and b (separate them by a space), where a is the maximum amount of books the organizers can include into the exposition, and b — the amount of the time periods, during which Berlbury published a books, and the height difference between the lowest and the highest among these books is not more than k milllimeters.

In each of the following b lines print two integer numbers separated by a space — indexes of the first and the last volumes from each of the required time periods of Berlbury's creative work.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the sliding window of books. Specifically, the program incorrectly breaks the outer loop when it encounters a pair of heights where the difference exceeds `k`. This premature breaking can lead to missing valid sequences of books.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3
10 12 15 14 11
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2
1 3
3 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 2
1 2
2 3
```

The program fails to identify the valid sequence from index 3 to 5, where the heights are 15, 14, and 11, and the maximum difference is 4 (15 - 11), which is within the allowed limit of 3. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `hLst` and `k` is a threshold value. The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n` integers which form the list `hLst`. The function aims to find the longest subarray within `hLst` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray is at most `k`. It also identifies all such subarrays of the same maximum length. After processing, the function prints the length of the longest subarray (`a`) and the number of such subarrays found (`len(r)`). For each identified subarray, it prints the starting and ending indices (1-based). The function handles edge cases such as when no valid subarray exists, in which case it will still print the length of the longest subarray found, even if it is zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
