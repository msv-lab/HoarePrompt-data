You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are several days left before the fiftieth birthday of a famous Berland's writer Berlbury. In this connection the local library decided to make an exposition of the works of this famous science-fiction writer. It was decided as well that it is necessary to include into the exposition only those books that were published during a particular time period. It is obvious that if the books differ much in size, the visitors will not like it. That was why the organizers came to the opinion, that the difference between the highest and the lowest books in the exposition should be not more than k millimeters.

The library has n volumes of books by Berlbury, arranged in chronological order of their appearance. The height of each book in millimeters is know, it is hi. As Berlbury is highly respected in the city, the organizers want to include into the exposition as many books as possible, and to find out what periods of his creative work they will manage to cover. You are asked to help the organizers cope with this hard task.

Input

The first line of the input data contains two integer numbers separated by a space n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 106) — the amount of books by Berlbury in the library, and the maximum allowed height difference between the lowest and the highest books. The second line contains n integer numbers separated by a space. Each number hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 106) is the height of the i-th book in millimeters.

Output

In the first line of the output data print two numbers a and b (separate them by a space), where a is the maximum amount of books the organizers can include into the exposition, and b — the amount of the time periods, during which Berlbury published a books, and the height difference between the lowest and the highest among these books is not more than k milllimeters.

In each of the following b lines print two integer numbers separated by a space — indexes of the first and the last volumes from each of the required time periods of Berlbury's creative work.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where all books have the same height and the maximum allowed height difference `k` is zero. In such a case, the program should be able to select all books, but it may not do so correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 0
10 10 10 10 10
```

Expected output:
```
5 1
1 5
```

However, the program might not produce this output correctly due to the way it manages the heaps and the indices of the minimum and maximum heights. The logic for updating the indices and the heaps might not be robust enough to handle this specific edge case.

To verify this, you can run the provided program with the above input and observe the output. If the output does not match the expected result, it confirms that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `hLst` and `k` is a threshold value. The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n` integers which form the list `hLst`. The function aims to find the longest subarray within `hLst` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray is at most `k`. It also identifies all such subarrays of the same maximum length. After processing, the function prints the length of the longest subarray (`a`) and the number of such subarrays found (`len(r)`). For each identified subarray, it prints the starting and ending indices (1-based). The function handles edge cases such as when no valid subarray exists, in which case it will still print the length of the longest subarray found, even if it is zero.
