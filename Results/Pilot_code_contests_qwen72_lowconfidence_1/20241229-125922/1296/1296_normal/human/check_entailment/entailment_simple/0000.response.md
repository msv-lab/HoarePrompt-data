Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the heights of the books. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables to keep track of the current window of books being considered (`i` and `j`), the maximum and minimum heights within the current window (`m` and `M`), and the corresponding indices (`mI` and `MI`). It also initializes a list `r` to store the results.

3. **Sliding Window Approach**: The program uses a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum heights is at most `k`. It maintains two heaps (`q1` and `q2`) to efficiently track the minimum and maximum heights in the current window.

4. **Updating the Window**: The program iterates through the list of book heights, expanding the window by moving the end index `j` and updating the minimum and maximum heights. If the difference between the maximum and minimum heights exceeds `k`, it adjusts the start index `i` to maintain the condition.

5. **Tracking Results**: The program keeps track of the maximum length of the valid subarray (`a`) and the corresponding subarray indices. It updates the list `r` with the starting and ending indices of all valid subarrays of this maximum length.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum length of the valid subarray and the number of such subarrays, followed by the starting and ending indices of each subarray. This matches the output format specified in the problem description.

The program handles all edge cases, including when the difference between the heights is exactly `k`, and when there are multiple valid subarrays of the same maximum length. The use of heaps ensures efficient management of the minimum and maximum heights within the sliding window, making the solution both correct and efficient.

Therefore, the program is correct as it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
