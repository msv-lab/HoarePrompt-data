Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the sliding window of books. Specifically, the program incorrectly breaks the outer loop when it encounters a pair of heights where the difference exceeds `k`. This premature breaking can lead to missing valid sequences of books.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3
10 12 15 14 11
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2
1 3
3 5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 2
1 2
2 3
```

The program fails to identify the valid sequence from index 3 to 5, where the heights are 15, 14, and 11, and the maximum difference is 4 (15 - 11), which is within the allowed limit of 3. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to an incorrect result.
