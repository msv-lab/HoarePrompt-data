Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where all books have the same height and the maximum allowed height difference `k` is zero. In such a case, the program should be able to select all books, but it may not do so correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 0
10 10 10 10 10
```

Expected output:
```
5 1
1 5
```

However, the program might not produce this output correctly due to the way it manages the heaps and the indices of the minimum and maximum heights. The logic for updating the indices and the heaps might not be robust enough to handle this specific edge case.

To verify this, you can run the provided program with the above input and observe the output. If the output does not match the expected result, it confirms that the program is incorrect.
