Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem described, but it has some issues that prevent it from fully meeting the requirements. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Break Condition in the First Loop:**
   The first loop that initializes the initial segment of the subarray breaks when the condition `M - m > k` is met. However, this break condition is not optimal because it stops prematurely. The loop should continue expanding the subarray until it cannot be expanded further, even if the condition `M - m > k` is temporarily violated. This can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling of Initial Segment:**
   The initial segment of the subarray is not correctly handled. The program initializes `m` and `M` with the first element of the list and then immediately starts the loop. This can lead to incorrect initial values for `m` and `M`, especially if the first element is not the smallest or largest in the list.

3. **Updating the Subarray Length and Indices:**
   The program updates the subarray length and indices in a way that can miss some valid subarrays. Specifically, the logic for updating `i` and `j` when the condition `M - m > k` is met is not robust enough to handle all edge cases. For example, it might skip valid subarrays that start at different positions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if all books have the same height, the program should output the entire range of books, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 3
10 12 11 13 14
```

The expected output should be:
```
4 2
1 4
2 5
```

However, the provided program might output:
```
3 2
1 3
2 4
```

This is because the program prematurely breaks out of the loop when it encounters a height difference greater than `k`, leading to a suboptimal solution.

### Correct Approach:

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Use a sliding window approach to expand the subarray as much as possible while maintaining the condition `M - m <= k`.
2. Keep track of the maximum subarray length and all subarrays that meet this condition.
3. Handle edge cases where all heights are the same or other special scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    hLst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    a = 0
    r = []
    i = 0
    j = 0
    min_heap = []
    max_heap = []
    
    while j < n:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (hLst[j], j))
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-hLst[j], j))
        
        while -max_heap[0][0] - min_heap[0][0] > k:
            i = min(min_heap[0][1], max_heap[0][1]) + 1
            while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < i:
                heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            while max_heap and max_heap[0][1] < i:
                heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        if j - i + 1 > a:
            a = j - i + 1
            r = [(i + 1, j + 1)]
        elif j - i + 1 == a:
            r.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
        j += 1
    
    print(a, len(r))
    for x in r:
        print(x[0], x[1])

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the problem description and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
