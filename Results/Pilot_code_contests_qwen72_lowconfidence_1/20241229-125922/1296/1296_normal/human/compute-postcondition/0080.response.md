The code snippet updates the value of `mI` to the current value of `t`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `mI` is updated to the value of `t`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the specific changes are:

- `mI` was previously the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).**
