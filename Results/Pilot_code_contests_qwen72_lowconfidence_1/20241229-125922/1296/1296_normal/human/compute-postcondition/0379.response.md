Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the final value of `i` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray `hLst[i:j]` is at most `k`, `j` is the final value of `j` and is either the index where `M - m > k` or `n` if the loop completes without breaking, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`, `a` is the length of the longest subarray found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` representing the starting and ending indices of all subarrays found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k` and whose length is equal to `a`, and if `j - i == a`, a new tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`.***
