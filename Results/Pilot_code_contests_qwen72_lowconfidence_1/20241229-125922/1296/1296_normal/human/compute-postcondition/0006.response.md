The code initializes an empty list `q1`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the original initial state information plus the new value for `q1`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of n integers where each hi satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is an empty list**
