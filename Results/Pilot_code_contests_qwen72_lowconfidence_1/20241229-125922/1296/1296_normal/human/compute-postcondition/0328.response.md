Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is set to `hLst[j]`, `M` is set to `hLst[j]`, `mI` is set to `j`, `MI` is set to `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed. Otherwise, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, and if `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`. Additionally, `w` is greater than or equal to `M`.**
