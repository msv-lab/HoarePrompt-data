To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it terminates. The loop continues as long as `j < n` and `M - m <= k`. The loop updates the minimum and maximum values (`m` and `M`) and their indices (`mI` and `MI`), and pushes elements into the priority queues `q1` and `q2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
   - `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is updated based on the condition: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise.
   - `j` is less than `n`.
   - `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
   - `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
   - `w` is the last value processed.
   - `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
   - `prevJ` is the last index processed.
   - `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the loop processes the next element in `hLst` at index `j`.
   - It updates the minimum and maximum values and their indices.
   - It pushes the current element into the priority queues `q1` and `q2`.
   - The loop breaks if the difference between the maximum and minimum values exceeds `k`.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates when `j` reaches `n` or when `M - m > k`.

### Final Output State

After the loop has finished executing, the following conditions hold:

- **`n`**: Remains the first integer input.
- **`k`**: Remains the second integer input.
- **`h`**: Remains a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- **`hLst`**: Remains a list of integers from the input.
- **`i`**: Updated based on the condition: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise.
- **`j`**: Either equals `n` or the last index where `M - m` was still within the limit `k`.
- **`m`**: The minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- **`M`**: The maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- **`mI`**: The index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- **`MI`**: The index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- **`q1`**: A list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- **`q2`**: A list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- **`w`**: The last value processed.
- **`t`**: The index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- **`prevJ`**: The last index processed.
- **`r`**: A list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`.
