The value of `i` is updated to `MI + 1`. This change affects the value of `i` directly, while the other variables remain unchanged or maintain their conditions.

- `n` remains the first integer input.
- `k` remains the second integer input.
- `h` remains a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` remains a list of integers from the input.
- `j` remains less than `n`.
- `m` remains the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` remains the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` remains the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` remains the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` remains a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` remains a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` remains the last value processed.
- `t` remains the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` remains the last index processed.
- `r` remains a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.
