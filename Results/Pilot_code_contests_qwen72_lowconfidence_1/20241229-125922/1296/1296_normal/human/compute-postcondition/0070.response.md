The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` pops the smallest element from the heap `q1` and assigns the tuple's first element to `w` and the second element to `t`.

Given the initial state, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`. The smallest element in this heap (based on the `value` in the tuple) is removed, and its components are assigned to `w` and `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- The index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).
