To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop: `j < n`.

### Analysis:
- **`j`**: This is the index where the loop stopped. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
- **`n`**: This is the length of the list `h`. Since `n` is the length of the list, it should be a non-negative integer. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is the last value processed.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
The loop will execute if `j < n`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j` must be less than `n`**: If `j` is already less than `n`, no adjustment is needed.
- **`n` must be a positive integer**: Since `n` is the length of the list `h`, it must be a positive integer for the loop to have a chance to execute.

### Conclusion:
Given that `n` is the length of the list `h` and `j` is the index where the loop stopped, the only requirement is that `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `n` is a positive integer (as it is the length of a list), no further adjustments are needed.
