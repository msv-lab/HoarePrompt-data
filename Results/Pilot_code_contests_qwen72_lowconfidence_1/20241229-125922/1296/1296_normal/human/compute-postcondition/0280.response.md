The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` changes the values of `w` and `t` by popping the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) from the heap `q1`.

### Impact of the Code:
- `w` is updated to the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is updated to the index of the value in `hLst` corresponding to the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `q1` is modified by removing the tuple that was popped.

### Calculation:
- The tuple `(value, index)` is popped from `q1`.
- `w` is set to `value`.
- `t` is set to `index`.

### Output State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(value_min, index_min)`, and the tuple that was just popped.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is the index of the value in `hLst` corresponding to the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
