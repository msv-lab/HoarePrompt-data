The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` pops the smallest element (based on the negative value) from the heap `q2` and assigns the unpacked values to `w` and `t`. Since `q2` contains tuples of `(-value, index)`, popping the smallest element from `q2` will give the largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `MI + 1`
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `w` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `j - i` is not equal to 1
- `mI` is not less than `MI`

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- `w` is updated to the negative value of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j` (since `q2` stores negative values).
- `t` is updated to the index of this maximum value.

Therefore, the new values of `w` and `t` are:
- `w` is now `-max_value_in_hLst_up_to_j`
- `t` is now the index of this maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
