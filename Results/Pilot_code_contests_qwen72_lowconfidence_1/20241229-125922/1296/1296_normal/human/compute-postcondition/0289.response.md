The code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` pops the smallest element (based on the first item of the tuple) from the heap `q2` and assigns the two values of the tuple to `w` and `t`.

Given the initial state, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`. Since `i` is `mI + 1`, the smallest element in `q2` will be the one with the highest `value` (because the values in `q2` are negated).

Therefore, after executing this line of code:
- `w` will be assigned the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the elements in `q2`.
- `t` will be assigned the index of this highest value in `hLst`.

Since `q2` is a heap, the smallest element (based on the first item of the tuple) is removed from `q2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the value of `w`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`, `q2` is updated by removing the tuple `(-value, index)` with the highest `value` from it.**
