The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, t))` pushes the tuple `(w, t)` into the heap `q1`. This operation updates the state of `q1` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `j` is less than `n`
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `q1` is an empty list
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`
- `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
- `t` is the index of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
- `t` is less than `mI + 1`
- `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`
- `i` is `mI + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `q1` now contains the tuple `(w, t)`

The output state is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`**
