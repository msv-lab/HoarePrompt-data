The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` removes the smallest element (based on the first item of the tuple) from the heap `q1` and assigns the value and index to `w` and `t` respectively.

Given the initial state, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`. Since `q1` is a heap, the smallest element (in terms of the `value`) will be removed and its value and index will be assigned to `w` and `t`.

Let's assume the smallest element in `q1` is `(v, idx)`, where `v` is the value and `idx` is the index. After executing the code, `w` will be `v` and `t` will be `idx`.

The output state will reflect these changes:

- `w` is now `v` (the smallest value in `q1`).
- `t` is now `idx` (the index of the smallest value in `q1`).

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`, `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
