To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

### Current State Analysis:
- `t` is the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `i` is `MI + 1`, where `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than `i`. Let's break down the necessary conditions:

1. **`t` must be less than `i`:**
   - Since `i` is `MI + 1`, `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.
   - This implies that `t` must be less than or equal to `MI`.

2. **Ensuring `t` is valid:**
   - `t` is derived from the tuple popped from `q2`, which contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
   - For `t` to be less than `i`, the tuple popped from `q2` must have an index that is less than `i`.

Given the current state, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `i` for the loop to execute. This means that the tuple popped from `q2` must have an index that is less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `t` is less than `i`:**
  - The tuple popped from `q2` should have an index that is less than `i`.
  - Since `i` is `MI + 1`, the tuple popped from `q2` should have an index that is less than or equal to `MI`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted such that the tuple popped from `q2` has an index `t` that is less than `i`. Given the current state, we can assume that `q2` contains at least one tuple with an index less than `i`.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, minus the tuple that was just popped, `w` is the `-value` part of the tuple popped from `q2`, `t` is the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`, and `t` must be less than `i`**.
