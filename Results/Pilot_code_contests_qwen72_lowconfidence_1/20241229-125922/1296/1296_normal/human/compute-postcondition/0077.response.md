To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables involved. The loop continues to execute as long as `t < i`. Each iteration of the loop pops the smallest element from the heap `q1` and assigns the values to `w` and `t`.

Let's break down the final state step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop stops when `t` is no longer less than `i`. This means that the last tuple `(w, t)` popped from `q1` had `t` such that `t >= i`.

2. **State of `q1`**: After the loop finishes, `q1` will be missing all the tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i`. The remaining tuples in `q1` will have `t` values that are greater than or equal to `i`.

3. **State of `w` and `t`**: The final values of `w` and `t` will be the smallest tuple `(w, t)` that was in `q1` where `t` is no longer less than `i`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q2`, `prevJ`, `j - i`, and the relationship between `mI` and `MI`) remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the changes in `q1`, `w`, and `t`.

Given these considerations, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).**
