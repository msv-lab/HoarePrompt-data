To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is `t`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is the negative of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- The index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).

The key condition for the loop to execute is `t < i`. Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `mI + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `i = mI + 1`
   - `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

2. **Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `t < i`.
   - This translates to `t < mI + 1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.
   - Since `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `mI + 1`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Ensure that `t` is less than `mI + 1`.
   - This means `t` should be less than `i`.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is less than `mI + 1`. Therefore, the state right before the loop should be:

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the negative of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`). Additionally, `t` must be less than `i`**.
