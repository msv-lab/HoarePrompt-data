To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while t < i:
```

This loop will continue as long as `t` is less than `i`.

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is `-max_value_in_hLst_up_to_j`.
- `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `t < i`.
- `i` is defined as `MI + 1`.
- `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is `MI + 1`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `MI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `t` must be less than `MI + 1`, no adjustment is needed for `t` or `i` as they already satisfy the condition.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `prevJ`) do not directly affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
The current state already satisfies the condition `t < i`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.
