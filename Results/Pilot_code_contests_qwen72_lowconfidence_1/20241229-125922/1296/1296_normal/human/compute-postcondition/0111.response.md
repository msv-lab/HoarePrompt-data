The provided code snippet `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, t))` adds a tuple `(w, t)` to the heap `q1`. The variable `w` is not defined in the initial state, so it's assumed to be a value that is part of the context but not explicitly stated. The variable `t` is equal to `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, the impact of the code on the program is as follows:

- The tuple `(w, t)` is added to the heap `q1`.
- The value of `t` is `i - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, `mI` is not less than `MI`, `t` is equal to `i - 1`**.
