The provided code snippet assigns the value of `w` to `m`.

- `m` is updated to the value of `w`, which is `hLst[j]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `t`, `prevJ`, `a`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables that were true before the assignment remain true after the assignment, except for the value of `m`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n`, `m` is now `hLst[j]`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and includes the new tuple `(w, j)` if `prevJ != j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)` if `prevJ != j`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is `j` if `prevJ != j` and remains unchanged otherwise, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if `prevJ != j`, and `mI` is less than `MI` if `prevJ != j` and `w >= M`, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`. If `w` is greater than or equal to `M` and `prevJ != j`, then `M` is updated to `w`, `MI` is updated to `j`, and the values of `m`, `mI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain as described above. If `prevJ == j`, the values of `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged. If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
