The code `heapq.heappush(q2, (w, t))` adds the tuple `(w, t)` to the heap `q2`. Here, `w` is the negative of the largest value in `hLst` up to index `j` with an index greater than or equal to `i`, and `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing all tuples `(-value, index)` where `index < i`.
- `w` is the negative of the largest value in `hLst` up to index `j` with an index greater than or equal to `i`.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- The index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).

After executing the code:
- The tuple `(w, t)` is added to the heap `q2`.
