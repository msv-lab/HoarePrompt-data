To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and ensure that the state meets this condition.

The `while` loop condition is `j < n`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]`.
- `M` is `hLst[0]` or `hLst[1]` depending on the condition.
- `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0.
- `MI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[0]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0.
- `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`.
- `q2` is a list containing the tuples `(-hLst[0], 0)` and `(-hLst[1], 1)`.
- `w` is `hLst[1]`.
- `prevJ` is 1.

The key variable here is `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 2, the only requirement is that `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. All other states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is the first integer input and must be greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]`, `M` is `hLst[0]` or `hLst[1]` depending on the condition, `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, `MI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[0]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuples `(-hLst[0], 0)` and `(-hLst[1], 1)`, `w` is `hLst[1]`, `prevJ` is 1.**
