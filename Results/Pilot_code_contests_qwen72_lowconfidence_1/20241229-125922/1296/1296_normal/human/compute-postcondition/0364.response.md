The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, j))` adds the tuple `(w, j)` to the heap `q1`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the variables involved**: `q1`, `w`, and `j`.
2. **Check the previous values**:
   - `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`.
   - `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`.
   - `j` is the current index being processed.
3. **Impact of the code**:
   - The tuple `(w, j)` is pushed into the heap `q1`.
   - The heap property of `q1` is maintained, meaning `q1` remains a min-heap based on the first element of the tuples.

Since the code only affects `q1` by adding a new tuple, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is `j + 1` and `j` is less than `n`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == 1`, `i` is incremented by 1. `m` is set to `hLst[j]`, `M` is set to `w`, `mI` is set to `j`, and `MI` is set to `j` if `w >= M`. `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`. `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`. `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`. `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`. If `w <= m`, then `mI` is set to `j`, `m` is updated to `w`. If `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w`, `MI` is set to `j`. If `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`. If `prevJ == j`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `M - m > k`, the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
