The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q2, (-w, j))` pushes the tuple `(-w, j)` into the list `q2`, which is a max-heap of tuples `(-value, index)`.

Given the initial state and the specific changes and their impacts:

- `q2` is updated to include the new tuple `(-w, j)`. This means the list `q2` now contains all its previous elements plus the new tuple `(-w, j)`.
- The values of `w` and `j` remain the same as they were before the execution of the code snippet.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `j`, `r`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `t`, `prevJ`, and `i`) are not directly modified by this code snippet and retain their previous values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is set to `hLst[j]`, `M` is set to `hLst[j]`, `mI` is set to `j`, `MI` is set to `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`, `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed. If `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w`, `MI` is set to `j`, and the rest of the variables (`m`, `mI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `prevJ`, and `i`) are as described in the precondition. Otherwise, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, and if `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`. Additionally, `prevJ` is not equal to `j`.**
