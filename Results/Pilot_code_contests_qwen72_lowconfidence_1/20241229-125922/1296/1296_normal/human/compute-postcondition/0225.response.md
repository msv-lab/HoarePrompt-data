The code snippet `M = w` updates the value of `M` to be equal to `w`. Given the initial state, `w` is `hLst[j]`, so `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is updated as follows: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- If `j - i == 1`, `m` and `M` are both set to `hLst[j]`, and `mI` and `MI` are both set to `j`.
- `w` is `hLst[j]`.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed.
- `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`.
- If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.
- If `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `w` and `mI` is updated to `j`.
- `w` is greater than or equal to `M`.

After executing `M = w`, the value of `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`.
