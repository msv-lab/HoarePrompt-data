Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 â‰¤ `hi` â‰¤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the last value processed, `prevJ` is the last index processed. If `j - i` > `a`, then `a` is updated to `j` and `r` is set to `[(1, j)]`. If `j - i` <= `a`, then `a` remains 0, and `r` is an empty list unless `j - i` equals `a`, in which case `r` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.***
