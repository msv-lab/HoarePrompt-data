Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[0]`, `prevJ` is 0. If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` in the list `hLst` is greater than `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
