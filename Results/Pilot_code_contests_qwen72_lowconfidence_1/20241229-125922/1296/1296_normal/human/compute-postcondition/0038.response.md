The code snippet increments the value of `j` by 1. The previous value of `j` was 1, so after the increment, `j` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]`, `M` is `hLst[0]` or `hLst[1]` depending on the condition, `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, `MI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[0]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuples `(-hLst[0], 0)` and `(-hLst[1], 1)`, `w` is `hLst[1]`, `prevJ` is 1. If `M - m > k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state unchanged.**
