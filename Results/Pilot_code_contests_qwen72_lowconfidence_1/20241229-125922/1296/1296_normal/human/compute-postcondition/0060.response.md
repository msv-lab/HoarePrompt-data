The code snippet `r.append((i + 1, j))` appends the tuple `(i + 1, j)` to the list `r`. This means that the list `r`, which was initially empty, now contains one element: the tuple `(i + 1, j)`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `r` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the last value processed, `prevJ` is the last index processed, and `j - i` is equal to `a`.**
