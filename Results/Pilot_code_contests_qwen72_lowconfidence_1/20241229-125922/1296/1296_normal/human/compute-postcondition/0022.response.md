The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure immediately. Since no loops or conditionals are explicitly shown in the snippet, we assume this `break` is part of a larger context not provided here, and its effect is to terminate the current loop or conditional block.

The values of the variables remain unchanged by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the output state reflects the same values as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that the `break` has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[0]`, `prevJ` is 0, and the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` in the list `hLst` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
