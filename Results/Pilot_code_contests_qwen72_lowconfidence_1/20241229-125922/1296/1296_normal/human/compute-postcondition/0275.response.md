The code snippet `mI = MI = j` updates the values of `mI` and `MI` to the current value of `j`.

- `mI` was previously the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` was previously the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- Both `mI` and `MI` are now set to the current value of `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is updated based on the condition: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is `hLst[j]`, `M` is `hLst[j]`, `mI` is `j`, `MI` is `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`.**
