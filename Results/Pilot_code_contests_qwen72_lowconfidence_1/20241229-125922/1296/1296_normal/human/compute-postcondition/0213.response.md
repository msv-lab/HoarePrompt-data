Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is `-w`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j` that is not less than `i`, `w` is the value of the smallest element in `q1` after the operation, `t` is the index of this smallest element in `hLst` and must be less than `MI + 1`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the smallest element, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is not less than `MI` (i.e., `mI >= MI`), and if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`. If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`. The smallest element `(w, t)` has been removed from `q1`.**
