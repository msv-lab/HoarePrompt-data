To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `w` is `hLst[j]`.
- If `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, and `MI` is updated to `j`.
- `m` remains the current minimum value in `q1`.
- `mI` remains the index of the current minimum value in `q1`.
- `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`.
- `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j)`.
- If `prevJ != j`, then `prevJ` is updated to `j`.
- If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
- The current state indicates that `j` has been incremented by 1.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is already incremented by 1, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, if `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, `MI` is updated to `j`, `m` remains the current minimum value in `q1`, `mI` remains the index of the current minimum value in `q1`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j)`, if `prevJ != j`, then `prevJ` is updated to `j`, `j` must be less than `n`**.
