The code snippet provided is:

```python
w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)
```

This line of code impacts the following variables:
- `w`: This variable is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t`: This variable is assigned the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `q1`: The list `q1` loses its first element (the one that was popped).

Let's list the updated state:

- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`. **(Updated: `q1` loses the first element)**
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`. **(Updated: `w` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`)**
- `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`. **(Updated: `t` is assigned the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`)**
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed.
- `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`.
- If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, and `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, and `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.**
