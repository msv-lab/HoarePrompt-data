To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `t < i`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `mI + 1`
- `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be less than `i`. Since `i` is `mI + 1`, the condition `t < i` simplifies to `t < mI + 1`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Check the condition `t < i`:**
   - `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `i` is `mI + 1`, where `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.

2. **Adjustments needed:**
   - The current state indicates that `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.

Since the current state already specifies that `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` and `i` is `mI + 1`, the condition `t < i` should hold true as long as `t` is not equal to `mI + 1`.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time. The state remains the same.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)`, `w` is the negative of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
