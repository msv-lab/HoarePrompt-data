The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input and must be greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]` if `w` > `m`, otherwise `m` is `hLst[2]`, `w` is `hLst[2]`, `M` is `hLst[2]` if `w` ≥ `M`, `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, and becomes 2 if `w` ≤ `m`, `MI` is 2 if `hLst[1]` ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[2]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)`, `(hLst[1], 1)`, and `(hLst[2], 2)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuples `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `(-hLst[1], 1)`, and `(-hLst[2], 2)`, `prevJ` is 2. If `M - m > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
