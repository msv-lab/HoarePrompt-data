The code snippet `m = M = hLst[j]` updates the variables `m` and `M` to the value of `hLst[j]`. This means both `m` and `M` now hold the same value, which is the element at index `j` in the list `hLst`.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is updated based on the condition: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is now equal to `hLst[j]`.
- `M` is now equal to `hLst[j]`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the last value processed.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`.
