The code snippet updates the list `r` by appending a tuple `(i + 1, j)` to it. Here's the detailed impact on the program:

- The value of `i` is 0.
- The value of `j` is the index where the loop stopped and is less than `n`.
- The list `r` is initially empty and now contains the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, which simplifies to `(1, j)`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `a`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `prevJ`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is `j`, `i` is 0, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `r` is [(1, j)], `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the last value processed, `prevJ` is the last index processed, and the difference between `j` and `i` is greater than `a`.**
