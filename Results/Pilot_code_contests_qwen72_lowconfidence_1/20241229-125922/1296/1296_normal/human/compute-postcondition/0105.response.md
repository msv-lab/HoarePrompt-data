The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` removes the smallest element (based on the value) from the heap `q1` and assigns the value and index to `w` and `t`, respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `MI + 1`
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`
- `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `j - i` is not equal to 1
- `mI` is not less than `MI`
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `w` is assigned the smallest value from `q1`
- `t` is assigned the index of the smallest value from `q1`
- The smallest element (tuple) is removed from `q1`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `MI + 1`
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element and the element just removed
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`
- `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `j - i` is not equal to 1
- `mI` is not less than `MI`
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`
