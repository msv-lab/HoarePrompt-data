The line of code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` pops the smallest element (in terms of the first item of the tuple, which is `-value`) from the heap `q2` and assigns the two elements of the tuple to `w` and `t` respectively. Given the structure of `q2`, this means:

- `w` will be assigned the negative of the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j` (since `q2` stores tuples of `(-value, index)`).
- `t` will be assigned the index of this value in `hLst`.

Since `q2` was previously missing the tuple `(-M, MI)`, the tuple being popped here is the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, not necessarily the maximum value `M`.

The specific values of `w` and `t` depend on the contents of `q2` before the operation, but we can generally say that `w` will be the negative of the next largest value and `t` will be its corresponding index.

Given the initial conditions, the updated state will reflect these changes while keeping all other conditions unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)` and the tuple that was just popped, `w` is the negative of the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
