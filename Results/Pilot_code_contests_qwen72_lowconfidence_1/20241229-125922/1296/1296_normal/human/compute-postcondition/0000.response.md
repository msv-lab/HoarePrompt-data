The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively, replacing their initial values. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will take on new values based on the input.

The list `h` remains unchanged and retains its initial property of being a list of `n` integers where each element `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of n integers where each hi satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6**
