The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q2, (w, t))` adds the tuple `(w, t)` to the heap `q2`. This operation modifies the state of `q2` by adding this tuple, which represents the largest value in the remaining elements of `q2` after the loop, along with its index.

Here is the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Impact on `q2`:**
   - The tuple `(w, t)` is added to `q2`.
   - `q2` now contains the tuple `(w, t)` along with the existing elements.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - No other variables are directly modified by this operation.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `w`, `t`, `prevJ`, and `r` remain unchanged.

3. **Output State:**
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
   - `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is `mI + 1`.
   - `j` is less than `n`.
   - `m` is the value of `w` before the loop started.
   - `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `mI` is the final value of `t` after the loop.
   - `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the elements that were popped, and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`.
   - `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now missing all tuples that were popped during the loop. **It now also includes the tuple `(w, t)`.**
   - `w` is the largest value in the remaining elements of `q2` after the loop.
   - `t` is the index of the largest value in the remaining elements of `q2` after the loop.
   - `prevJ` is the last index processed.
   - `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed.
   - `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
   - If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`.
   - If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.
