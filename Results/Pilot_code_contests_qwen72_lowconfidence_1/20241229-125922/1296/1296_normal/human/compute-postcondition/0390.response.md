Functionality: ** The function `func` processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `hLst` and `k` is a threshold value. The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n` integers which form the list `hLst`. The function aims to find the longest subarray within `hLst` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray is at most `k`. It also identifies all such subarrays of the same maximum length. After processing, the function prints the length of the longest subarray (`a`) and the number of such subarrays found (`len(r)`). For each identified subarray, it prints the starting and ending indices (1-based). The function handles edge cases such as when no valid subarray exists, in which case it will still print the length of the longest subarray found, even if it is zero. **

### Key Points:
- **Parameters**: The function implicitly takes two inputs `n` and `k` from `raw_input()`, and a list `hLst` of `n` integers.
- **Output**: The function prints the length of the longest valid subarray (`a`), the number of such subarrays (`len(r)`), and the starting and ending indices of each such subarray.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `n` is 0 or `k` is negative, the function will not process any subarrays and will print `0 0`.
  - If no subarray meets the condition `M - m <= k`, the function will print `0 0`.
  - If the entire list `hLst` is a valid subarray, the function will print the length of `hLst` and the single subarray covering the entire list.
- **Missing Functionality**:
  - The function does not handle invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer inputs or incorrect number of inputs).
  - The function assumes that the input will always be valid and does not include error handling for unexpected input scenarios.
