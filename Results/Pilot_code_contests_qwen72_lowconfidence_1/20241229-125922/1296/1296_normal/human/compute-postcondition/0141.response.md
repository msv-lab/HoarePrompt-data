Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n`, `w` is `hLst[j]`. If `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, `MI` is updated to `j`, `m` remains the current minimum value in `q1`, `mI` remains the index of the current minimum value in `q1`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` is updated to include the new tuple `(w, j)` if `prevJ != j`. If `prevJ == j`, the values of `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged. If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
