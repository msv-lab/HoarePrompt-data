The given Python code snippet pushes a new tuple `(-w, j)` into the heap `q2` using the `heapq.heappush()` function. This operation modifies the heap `q2` by adding the new element and ensuring that the heap property is maintained. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged unless specified by the conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n`.
- `w` is `hLst[j]`.
- If `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, `MI` is updated to `j`.
- `m` remains the current minimum value in `q1`.
- `mI` remains the index of the current minimum value in `q1`.
- `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`.
- `q2` is updated to include the new tuple `(w, j)` if `prevJ != j`. If `prevJ == j`, the values of `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code snippet:
- The heap `q2` is updated to include the new tuple `(-w, j)`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1` and must be less than `n`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, if `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, `MI` is updated to `j`, `m` remains the current minimum value in `q1`, `mI` remains the index of the current minimum value in `q1`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j)`, if `prevJ == j`, the values of `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `a`, and `r` remain unchanged, if the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
