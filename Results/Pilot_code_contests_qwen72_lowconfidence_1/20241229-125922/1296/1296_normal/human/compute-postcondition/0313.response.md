The line of code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` modifies the values of `w` and `t` by popping the smallest element (based on the value) from the heap `q1`. This operation changes the value of `w` to the value part of the tuple and `t` to the index part of the tuple that was popped.

Given the initial state, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`. After this operation:

- `w` is updated to the value part of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is updated to the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`.

Since the tuple `(w, t)` was already part of `q1`, the new values of `w` and `t` are the next smallest values in `q1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the `value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` and is now equal to `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the value part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
