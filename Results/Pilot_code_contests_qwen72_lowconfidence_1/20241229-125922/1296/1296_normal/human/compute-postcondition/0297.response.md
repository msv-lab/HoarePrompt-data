The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q2, (w, t))` adds the tuple `(w, t)` to the heap `q2`. Here, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, and `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `w`, `t`, `index_min`, `prevJ`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the changes in `q2`.

- `q2` is updated by adding the tuple `(w, t)` to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the value of `w`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `t` is no longer less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`.**
