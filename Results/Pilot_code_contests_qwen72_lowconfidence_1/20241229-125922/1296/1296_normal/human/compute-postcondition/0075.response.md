To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition `t < i`.

### Given State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- The index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).

### Condition Analysis:
The loop condition is `t < i`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true after the state is adjusted.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **`t`**: Since `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, it must be less than `i` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `t` must remain less than `i`.
2. **`i`**: `i` is defined as `mI + 1`. Since `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` up to index `j`, `i` should remain `mI + 1` to ensure the condition `t < i` holds true.
3. **`mI`**: The index of the minimum value `m` must remain less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`). This ensures that the relationship between `mI` and `MI` is maintained.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, no changes are necessary to the given state, as the condition `t < i` is already satisfied. The values of `t` and `i` are correctly set based on the current state.
