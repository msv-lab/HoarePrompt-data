To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

Given the state before the loop:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `w` is the value from the popped tuple in `q2`.
- `t` is the index from the popped tuple in `q2`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.

The condition `t < i` must be true for the loop to execute. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Ensure `t` is defined and valid**: Since `t` is the index from the popped tuple in `q2`, `q2` must contain at least one tuple, and `t` must be a valid index.
2. **Ensure `i` is defined and valid**: `i` is `MI + 1`, so `MI` must be a valid index in `hLst` (i.e., `0 ≤ MI < n`).
3. **Ensure `t < i`**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than `i`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is the index from the popped tuple in `q2`.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.

If `t` is not less than `MI + 1`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `MI + 1`.

### Adjusted State
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is less than `MI + 1`.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the value from the popped tuple in `q2`, `t` is the index from the popped tuple in `q2` and must be less than `MI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
