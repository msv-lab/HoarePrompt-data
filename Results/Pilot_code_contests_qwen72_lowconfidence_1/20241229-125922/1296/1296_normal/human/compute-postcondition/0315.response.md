The line `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` pops the smallest element from the heap `q1` and assigns its value to `w` and its index to `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`.
- `w` and `t` are already defined but will be updated by this operation.

After executing the line, the following changes occur:
- `w` is assigned the value part of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is assigned the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`.

Since the exact values of `w` and `t` before the operation are not specified, we can only say that they are updated to the value and index of the smallest element in `q1`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the `value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` and is now equal to `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the value part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
