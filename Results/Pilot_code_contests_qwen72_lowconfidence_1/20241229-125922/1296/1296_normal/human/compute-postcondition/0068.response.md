Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the last value processed, `prevJ` is the last index processed. `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).***
