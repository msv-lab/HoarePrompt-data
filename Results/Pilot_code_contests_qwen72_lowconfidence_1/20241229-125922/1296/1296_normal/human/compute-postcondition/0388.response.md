To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the final values of the variables involved, especially focusing on the list `r` which is iterated over in the loop. Let's break down the final state based on the provided information and the loop code:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is the final value of `i` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray `hLst[i:j]` is at most `k`.
- `j` is the final value of `j` and is either the index where `M - m > k` or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the last value processed.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`.
- `a` is the length of the longest subarray found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k`.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` representing the starting and ending indices of all subarrays found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k` and whose length is equal to `a`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in r:
    print(str(x[0]) + ' ' + str(x[1]))
```

### Final Output State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is the final value of `i` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray `hLst[i:j]` is at most `k`.
- `j` is the final value of `j` and is either the index where `M - m > k` or `n` if the loop completes without breaking.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the last value processed.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`.
- `a` is the length of the longest subarray found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k`.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` representing the starting and ending indices of all subarrays found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k` and whose length is equal to `a`.
- All elements in `r` have been printed, with each element being a tuple `(i + 1, j)`.
