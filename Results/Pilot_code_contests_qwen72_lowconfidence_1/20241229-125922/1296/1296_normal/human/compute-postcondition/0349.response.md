The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, j))` pushes the tuple `(w, j)` into the heap `q1`. This operation updates the state of `q1` by adding the new tuple, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by this operation.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **`q1`**: The tuple `(w, j)` is added to the heap `q1`. Since `q1` is a min-heap, the tuple will be inserted in such a way that the heap property is maintained (i.e., the smallest element is at the root).

2. **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `j`, `r`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `w`, `t`, `prevJ`, `q2`, and the conditions involving these variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n` and `j` is now `j + 1`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is set to `hLst[j]`, `M` is set to `hLst[j]`, `mI` is set to `j`, `MI` is set to `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`, `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`. If `w <= m`, then `mI` is set to `j`. If `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w`, `MI` is set to `j`, and `M` is updated to `w`. Otherwise, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`, `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`, and if `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`. If `prevJ == j`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `M - m > k`, the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`.**
