The provided Python code snippet uses the `heapq.heappush` function to push a new element onto the heap `q1`. The element being pushed is a tuple `(w, t)`, where `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`, and `t` is the index of this last element.

Let's analyze the impact of this operation on the program:

- The `q1` list, which is a min-heap, will have a new element added to it: `(w, t)`.
- The `q1` list will be reorganized to maintain its heap property.
- The values of `w` and `t` are used to form the tuple being pushed, but their values remain unchanged.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q2`, `prevJ`, `a`, `r`) are not directly modified by this operation.

Therefore, the updated state of the program is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the elements that were popped, and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, and `t` must be greater than or equal to `i`.**
