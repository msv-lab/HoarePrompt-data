To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `t < i`. This condition must hold true for the loop to continue executing.

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is `t`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)` and the tuple that was just popped.
- `w` is the negative of the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- The index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).

### Analysis:
The loop condition `t < i` must be satisfied for the loop to execute again. Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, and `mI` is `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `i`.

- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `mI` is `t`.

For the loop to execute again, `t` must be less than `i`. Since `i` is `mI + 1` and `mI` is `t`, the condition `t < i` simplifies to `t < t + 1`, which is always true as long as `t` is an integer.

However, the loop will stop if `t` is no longer less than `i`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- No adjustments are needed to `t` because the condition `t < i` is inherently satisfied as long as `t` is an integer and `i` is `t + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)` and the tuple that was just popped, `w` is the negative of the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**
