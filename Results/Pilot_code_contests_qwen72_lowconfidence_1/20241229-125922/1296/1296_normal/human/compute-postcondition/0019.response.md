The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q2, (-w, j))` pushes the tuple `(-w, j)` into the heap `q2`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `a` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `m` is `hLst[0]`.
- `M` is `hLst[0]`.
- `mI` is 0.
- `MI` is 0.
- `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`.
- `q2` is an empty list.
- `w` is `hLst[0]`.

After executing the code:

- `q2` now contains the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[0]`**.
