The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` pops the smallest element (in terms of `-value`) from the heap `q2`. Since `q2` contains tuples of the form `(-value, index)`, popping the smallest element gives us the tuple with the highest `value` from `hLst`.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `w` is assigned the value from the popped tuple in `q2`, which is the highest value in `hLst` up to index `j` (since `q2` stores negative values, the smallest negative value corresponds to the largest positive value).
- `t` is assigned the index from the popped tuple in `q2`, which is the index of the highest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

Since `w` and `t` are updated, the rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` must be less than `MI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
