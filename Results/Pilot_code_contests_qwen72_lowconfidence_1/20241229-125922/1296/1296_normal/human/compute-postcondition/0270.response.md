The code snippet provided is:

```python
r = [(i + 1, j)]
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The variable `r` is updated to be a list containing a single tuple `(i + 1, j)`.
- This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `t`, `prevJ`, or `a`.

### Calculation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 in the tuple.
- The value of `j` remains the same in the tuple.
- The list `r` now contains a single tuple `(i + 1, j)`.

### Output State:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is updated based on the condition: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, `a` is `j - i`.**
