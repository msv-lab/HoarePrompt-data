The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` extracts the smallest element (based on the first item of the tuple, which is `-value`) from the heap `q2`. This operation modifies `q2` by removing the smallest element and updates the variables `w` and `t` with the values from the removed tuple.

Given the initial state, let's determine the impact of this operation:

- `w` is updated to the negative of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j` (as defined in the initial state).
- `t` is updated to the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j` (as defined in the initial state).
- `q2` is modified by removing the tuple `(-value, index)` that corresponds to the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

Since `w` and `t` are already defined in the initial state as the negative of the maximum value and the index of the maximum value, respectively, these variables will retain their definitions but will be updated with the specific values from the tuple extracted from `q2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)`, `w` is the negative of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).**
