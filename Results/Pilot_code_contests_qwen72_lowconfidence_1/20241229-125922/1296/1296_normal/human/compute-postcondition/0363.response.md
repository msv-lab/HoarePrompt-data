Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is `j + 1` and `j` is less than `n`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == 1`, `i` is incremented by 1. `m` is set to `hLst[j]`, `M` is set to `w`, `mI` is set to `j`, and `MI` is set to `j` if `w >= M`. `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, j)`. `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)`. `w` is the value of `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`. `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`. If `w <= m`, then `mI` is set to `j`, `m` is updated to `w`. If `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w`, `MI` is set to `j`. If `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`. If `prevJ == j`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `M - m > k`, the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
