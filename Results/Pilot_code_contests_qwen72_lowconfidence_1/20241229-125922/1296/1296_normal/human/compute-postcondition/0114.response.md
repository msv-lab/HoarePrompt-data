To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop will start executing.

The loop condition is `while j < n:`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Given State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)` if `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the last value processed, and if `j - i` is not equal to 1, `w` is the negative of the largest value in `hLst` up to index `j` with an index greater than or equal to `i`.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- If `j - i` > `a`, then `a` is updated to `j` and `r` is set to `[(1, j)]`.
- If `j - i` <= `a`, then `a` remains 0, and `r` is an empty list unless `j - i` equals `a`, in which case `r` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.

### Analysis:
- The key condition for the loop to execute is `j < n`.
- Since `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, the loop can execute if `j` is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The state provided already ensures that `j` is less than `n`, so no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.
