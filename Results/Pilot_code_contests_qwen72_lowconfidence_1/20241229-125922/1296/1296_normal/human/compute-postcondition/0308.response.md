The given Python code snippet is:

```python
heapq.heappush(q2, (w, t))
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The function `heapq.heappush` is used to push the tuple `(w, t)` onto the heap `q2`.
- `w` is the `-value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`.
- `t` is the `index` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`.

Since the code only affects the heap `q2` by adding a new element to it, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

### Updated Variables:
- `q2`: The list `q2` now includes the tuple `(w, t)`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `w` is the `-value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`.
- `t` is the `index` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- `t` is no longer less than `i`.

### Output State:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the `-value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`, `t` is the `index` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`, and `t` is no longer less than `i`.**
