You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the final value of `i` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray `hLst[i:j]` is at most `k`, `j` is the final value of `j` and is either the index where `M - m > k` or `n` if the loop completes without breaking, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`, `a` is the length of the longest subarray found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k`, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` representing the starting and ending indices of all subarrays found where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k` and whose length is equal to `a`, `r` must contain at least one tuple, `x` is the next tuple in `r`
```
print(str(x[0]) + ' ' + str(x[1]))

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
