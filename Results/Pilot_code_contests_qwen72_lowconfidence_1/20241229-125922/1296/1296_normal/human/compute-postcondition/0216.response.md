Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the value of `w` before the loop started if `mI < MI` and the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j` otherwise, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the final value of `t` after the loop if `mI < MI` and the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j` otherwise, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the elements that were popped, and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now missing all tuples that were popped during the loop, and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the largest value in the remaining elements of `q2` after the loop if `mI < MI` and the value of the smallest element in `q1` before the loop started otherwise, `t` is the index of the largest value in the remaining elements of `q2` after the loop if `mI < MI` and the index of the smallest element in `q1` before the loop started otherwise, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.***
