To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while t < i:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is less than `i`. Given the current state:

- `i` is `MI + 1`
- `t` is the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`
- `t` is less than `i`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be less than `i`. Let's break down the necessary conditions:

1. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `MI + 1`
   - `t` is less than `i`

2. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `t` is already less than `i`, no adjustment to `t` or `i` is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments, and the loop can proceed as is.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the `value` part of the last tuple popped from `q2`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` and is now equal to `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`, `w` is the value part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index part of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`**
