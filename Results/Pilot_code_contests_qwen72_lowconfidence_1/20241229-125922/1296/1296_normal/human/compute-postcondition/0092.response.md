The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` pops the smallest element (based on the negative value) from the heap `q2`. The popped element is a tuple containing a negative value and an index. The variable `w` is assigned the negative value, and `t` is assigned the index.

Given the initial state:
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `w` is assigned the negative value from the tuple, which means `w` will be the original value from `hLst` (since the value in `q2` is negated).
- `t` is assigned the index from the tuple.

Since the specific values of `w` and `t` depend on the content of `q2`, we can only say that `w` and `t` are updated based on the popped element from `q2`.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `prevJ`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the value from the popped tuple in `q2`, `t` is the index from the popped tuple in `q2`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`.**
