The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` pops the smallest element (based on the first item in the tuple) from the heap `q1` and assigns the value and index to `w` and `t` respectively.

Given the initial state, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`.

Since `q1` is a heap, the smallest element is always at the root of the heap. After popping this element, the heap property is maintained, and the next smallest element becomes the root.

### Impact of the Code:
- `w` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is assigned the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.

### Updated Values:
- `w` and `t` are updated with the values from the tuple popped from `q1`.
- The heap `q1` is modified by removing the tuple `(w, t)`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, and `t` must be less than `mI + 1`**.
