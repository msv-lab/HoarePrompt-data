To determine if the `while t < i:` loop can execute at least once, we need to evaluate the condition `t < i`. Given the state before the loop:

- `t` is `idx`
- `i` is `mI + 1`

The loop will execute if `t` (which is `idx`) is less than `i` (which is `mI + 1`). This means `idx` must be less than `mI + 1`.

However, from the provided state, we know that `t` must be greater than or equal to `i` (`t` must be greater than or equal to `mI + 1`). This directly contradicts the condition required for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `t` (or `idx`) is less than `i` (or `mI + 1`).

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is `mI + 1`
- `j` must be less than `n`
- `m` is the value of `w`
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `mI` is `t`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the elements that were popped, and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now missing the tuple `(-v, idx)`
- `w` is `v`
- `t` is `idx` and must be less than `i` (or `mI + 1`)
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed
- `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`
- if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`
- if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`
