The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q2, (w, t))` pushes the tuple `(w, t)` into the heap `q2`. Since `w` is the negative of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, and `t` is the index of this maximum value, the tuple `(w, t)` is added to `q2`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. The updated state includes the new element in `q2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`, `w` is the negative of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`**
