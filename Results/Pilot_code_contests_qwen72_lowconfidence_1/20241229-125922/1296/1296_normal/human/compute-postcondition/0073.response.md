To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition `t < i`. This condition checks whether the index `t` (which is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`) is less than `i` (which is `mI + 1`).

### Analysis:
- **Condition**: `t < i`
- **Current State**:
  - `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
  - `i` is `mI + 1`, where `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, this means `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **No Adjustment Needed**: Since `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, and `i` is `mI + 1`, the condition `t < i` should naturally hold true as long as `t` is less than `mI + 1`. This is because `t` is derived from the heap `q1`, which contains indices up to `j`, and `j` is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `t < i` is based on the current values of `t` and `i`, and no additional adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the state remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
