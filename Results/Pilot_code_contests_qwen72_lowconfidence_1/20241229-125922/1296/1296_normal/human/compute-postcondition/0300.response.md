The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` impacts the variables `w` and `t` by assigning them the value and index from the smallest element (based on the `-value` in the tuple) in the heap `q2`.

Given the initial state:
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the last value processed.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.

After executing the code:
- `w` is updated to the `-value` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `t` is updated to the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- The tuple is removed from `q2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, minus the tuple that was just popped.
- `w` is the `-value` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `t` is the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.
