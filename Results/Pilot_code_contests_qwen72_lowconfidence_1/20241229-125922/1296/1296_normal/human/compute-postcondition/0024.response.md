The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since the condition about breaking out of the loop or if statement is not triggered by this increment alone (as it depends on the values of `M` and `m` relative to `k`), the loop or if statement continues unless the condition is met in a subsequent iteration.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[0]`, `prevJ` is 0. If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` in the list `hLst` is greater than `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
