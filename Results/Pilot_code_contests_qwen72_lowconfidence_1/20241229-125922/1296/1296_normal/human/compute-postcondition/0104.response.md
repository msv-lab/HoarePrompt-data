To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `t < i`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation.
   - `i` is `MI + 1`.
   - `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is `MI + 1`, we need to ensure that `t` is less than `MI + 1`.

### Analysis:
- **`t` and `i` Relationship**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than `i`. Since `i = MI + 1`, `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.
- **Initial Values**: We need to ensure that `t` is less than `MI + 1`. If `t` is already less than `MI + 1`, no adjustment is needed. However, if `t` is greater than or equal to `MI + 1`, we need to adjust `t` to be less than `MI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `t < MI + 1`**: This is the primary condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute.

Given the complexity of the state, the simplest way to ensure the loop executes is to ensure that `t` is less than `MI + 1`. If `t` is already less than `MI + 1`, the loop will execute without any adjustments. If `t` is not less than `MI + 1`, we need to adjust `t` to be less than `MI + 1`.

### Final State:
Since the problem does not specify how to adjust `t` if it is not less than `MI + 1`, we will assume that `t` is already less than `MI + 1` for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`, `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`, and `t` must be less than `MI + 1`**.
