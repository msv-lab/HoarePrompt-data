To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

### Current State:
- `t` is the index of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `t < i` must be true for the loop to execute again.
- Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, the loop will execute again if `t` is less than `mI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `t` is already defined as being less than `mI + 1` in the current state, no adjustments are needed to `t` or `i` for the loop to execute one more time.
- The state of `q2` should be such that it still contains elements, and the next `t` value should be less than `mI + 1`.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the value of `w`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`, `q2` is updated by removing the tuple `(-value, index)` with the highest `value` from it.**
