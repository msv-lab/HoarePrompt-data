To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `t < i`.

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element and the element just removed.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`.
- `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation.
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.
- `q1` is updated by removing the tuple `(w, t)`.

### Analysis:
The loop condition `t < i` must be true for the loop to execute one more time. Given the current state, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, and `i` is `MI + 1`. For the loop to continue, `t` must be less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The current state already ensures that `t` is less than `i` because `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, and `i` is `MI + 1`, where `t` must be less than `MI + 1`.
- No other states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to the last index less than `i` and now equals `t`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing the smallest element and the element just removed, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, now including `(w, t)`, `w` is the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `q1` before the operation, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, `mI` is not less than `MI`, `t` must be less than `MI + 1`, `q1` is updated by removing the tuple `(w, t)`**
