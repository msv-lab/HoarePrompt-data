Output State: **`j` is the last index processed and is less than `n` if the loop did not break due to `M - m > k`. `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`. `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including all processed elements. `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and including all processed elements. `w` is the value of `hLst[j]` at the last iteration, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`. `prevJ` is the last index processed and is now equal to `j`. If `M - m > k`, the loop breaks and `j` is less than `n`. If `j` reaches `n`, the loop completes without breaking and `j` is equal to `n`. If `mI < MI`, then `i` is set to `mI + 1`; otherwise, `i` is set to `MI + 1`.**
