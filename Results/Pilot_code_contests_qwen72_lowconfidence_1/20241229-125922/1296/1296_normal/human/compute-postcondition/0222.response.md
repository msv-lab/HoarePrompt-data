Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is updated as follows: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise. `j` is less than `n`, `m` is `hLst[j]`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`. `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, and `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`. `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, and `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`. If `j - i == 1`, `m` and `M` are both set to `hLst[j]`, and `mI` and `MI` are both set to `j`. `w` is `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`. `prevJ` is the last index processed, and `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed. `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`. If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`. If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`. Additionally, `w` is less than or equal to `m`. `mI` is now `j`.**
