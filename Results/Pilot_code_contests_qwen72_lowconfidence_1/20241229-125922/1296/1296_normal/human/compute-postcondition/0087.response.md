The line of code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` impacts the program by modifying the values of `w` and `t`. Specifically:

- `w` and `t` are updated to the values of the tuple that is popped from `q2`.
- The tuple `(-value, index)` that is popped from `q2` is removed from the list, affecting the contents of `q2`.

Given the initial state, the values of `w` and `t` are determined by the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j` (excluding the previously removed tuples). The specific values of `w` and `t` depend on the contents of `q2` before the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` where `t` is no longer less than `i`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing all tuples `(w, t)` where `t < i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but missing the tuple `(-M, MI)` and the tuple that was just popped, `w` is the negative of the next largest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`).**
