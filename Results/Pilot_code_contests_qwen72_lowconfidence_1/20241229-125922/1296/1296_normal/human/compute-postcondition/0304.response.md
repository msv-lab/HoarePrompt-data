The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` extracts the smallest element (based on the `-value` part) from the heap `q2` and assigns the `-value` part to `w` and the `index` part to `t`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- The smallest element (based on the `-value` part) is removed from `q2`.
- `w` is assigned the `-value` part of this tuple.
- `t` is assigned the `index` part of this tuple.

Given the conditions:
- `t` must be less than `i`.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.

The updated state reflects the changes in `w`, `t`, and `q2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, minus the tuple that was just popped, `w` is the `-value` part of the tuple popped from `q2`, `t` is the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`, `mI` is not less than `MI`, and `t` must be less than `i`**.
