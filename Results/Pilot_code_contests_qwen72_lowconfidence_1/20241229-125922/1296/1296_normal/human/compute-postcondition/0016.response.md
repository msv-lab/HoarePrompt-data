The code snippet `MI = j` assigns the value of `j` to `MI`. Given that the initial state specifies `j` is 0, the value of `MI` is now 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is an empty list, `q2` is an empty list, `w` is `hLst[0]`, and `w` is greater than or equal to `M`.**
