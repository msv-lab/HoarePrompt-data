The line of code `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, j))` adds the tuple `(w, j)` to the heap `q1`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `q1` initially contains the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`.
- `w` is `hLst[1]`.
- `j` is 1.

After executing the line of code, `q1` will contain both tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `q1` now contains the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`.

All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]`, `M` is `hLst[0]` or `hLst[1]` depending on the condition, `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, `MI` is 1 if `w` (which is `hLst[1]`) ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[0]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[1]`, `prevJ` is 0.**
