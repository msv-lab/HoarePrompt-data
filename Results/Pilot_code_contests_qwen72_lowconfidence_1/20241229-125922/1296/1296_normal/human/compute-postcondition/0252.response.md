To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop condition:

### Given Conditions:
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop body is omitted, but it implies that the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while j < n:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration to occur, `j` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time is that `j` must be less than `n`.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the other states.

### Final State:
Since the only requirement is that `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, and the state already indicates that `j` is less than `n`, we can simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is updated as follows: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is less than `n` and `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `M` is the value of `hLst[j]` if `w >= M`; otherwise, `M` remains the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j-1` and is now equal to `j` if `w >= M`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and includes the tuple `(w, j)` if `prevJ != j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j)` if `prevJ != j-1`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is `j` if `prevJ != j`, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j-1)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j-1)`, if `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `w` and `mI` is updated to `j-1`. If `M - m > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
