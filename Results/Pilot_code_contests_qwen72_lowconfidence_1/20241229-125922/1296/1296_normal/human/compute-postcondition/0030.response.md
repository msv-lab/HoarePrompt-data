The code snippet `M = w` updates the value of `M` to be equal to the value of `w`. The value of `w` is `hLst[1]`. Therefore, `M` now holds the value of `hLst[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]`, `M` is `hLst[1]`, `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[1]`, `prevJ` is 0.**
