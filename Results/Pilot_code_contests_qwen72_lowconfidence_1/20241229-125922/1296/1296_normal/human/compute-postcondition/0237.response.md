To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is updated as follows: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is less than `n` and `j` is incremented by 1.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j-1`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j-1`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j-1)` if `prevJ != j-1`.
- If `j - i == 1`, `m` and `M` are both set to `hLst[j-1]`, and `mI` and `MI` are both set to `j-1`.
- `w` is `hLst[j-1]`.
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
- `prevJ` is `j-1` if `prevJ != j-1`.
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed.
- `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j-1)]`.
- If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j-1)`.
- If `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `w` and `mI` is updated to `j-1`.
- If `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w` and `MI` is set to `j-1`.
- `q1` now includes the tuple `(w, j-1)` if `prevJ != j-1`.
- If the difference between the maximum value `M` and the minimum value `m` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while j < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
The loop condition `j < n` must be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time. Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the key is to ensure that `j` remains less than `n`.

### States to Adjust:
- **`j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, it should remain less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is updated based on the condition `j - i == 1`. If this condition is true, `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, it is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise. This update must be consistent with the current values of `mI` and `MI`.
- **`m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`**: These values are updated based on the new value of `w` (which is `hLst[j-1]`). If `w` is less than or equal to `m`, `m` and `mI` are updated. If `w` is greater than or equal to `M`, `M` and `MI` are updated.
- **`q1` and `q2`**: These lists are updated based on the new value of `w` and the current value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the loop condition, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` remains less than `n` and all other conditions are met for the next iteration. Therefore, the state should be:

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is updated as follows: if `j - i == 1`, then `i` is increased by 1; otherwise, `i` is set to `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` and `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is less than `n` and `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j-1`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j-1` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(-w, j-1)` if `prevJ != j-1`, if `j - i == 1`, `m` and `M` are both set to `hLst[j-1]`, and `mI` and `MI` are both set to `j-1`, `w` is `hLst[j-1]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is `j-1` if `prevJ != j-1`, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j-1)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j-1)`, if `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `w` and `mI` is updated to `j-1`, if `w >= M`, then `M` is set to `w` and `MI` is set to `j-1`, `q1` now includes the tuple `(w, j-1)` if `prevJ != j-1`.**
