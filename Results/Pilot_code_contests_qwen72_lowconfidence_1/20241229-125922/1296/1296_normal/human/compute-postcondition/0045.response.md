Output State: **`n` is the first integer input and must be greater than 2, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `r` is an empty list, `m` is the minimum of `hLst[0]` and `hLst[1]` if `w` > `m`, otherwise `m` is `hLst[2]`. `M` is `hLst[2]`. `mI` is 1 if `hLst[1]` ≤ `hLst[0]` otherwise 0, and becomes 2 if `w` ≤ `m`. `MI` is 2 if `hLst[1]` ≥ `M` (initially `hLst[0]`), otherwise `MI` remains 0. `q1` is a list containing the tuples `(hLst[0], 0)` and `(hLst[1], 1)`. `q2` is a list containing the tuples `(-hLst[0], 0)` and `(-hLst[1], 1)`. `w` is `hLst[2]`. `prevJ` is 1.**
