The given code snippet `MI = j` updates the value of `MI` to the current value of `j`. Given the initial state, let's determine the impact of this code:

- `MI` is updated to the value of `j`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, `M` is `hLst[j]`, `MI` is `j`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j)`, if `prevJ != j`, then `prevJ` is updated to `j`, `j` must be less than `n`, `w` is `hLst[j]`. If `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `hLst[j]` and `mI` is updated to `j`.**
