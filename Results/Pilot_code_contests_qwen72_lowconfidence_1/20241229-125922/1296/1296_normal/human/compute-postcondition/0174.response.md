The line of code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` changes the values of `w` and `t` by popping the smallest element (based on the first element of the tuple) from the heap `q1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.
   - `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
   - `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is `mI + 1`.
   - `j` must be less than `n`.
   - `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
   - `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
   - `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
   - `w` is the last value processed.
   - `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`.
   - `prevJ` is the last index processed.
   - `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`.
   - If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`.
   - If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The `heapq.heappop(q1)` function pops the smallest element from the heap `q1`.
   - The popped element is a tuple `(value, index)`, which is assigned to `w` and `t` respectively.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `w` is updated to the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
   - `t` is updated to the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.

4. **Unchanged Values**:
   - All other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q2`, `prevJ`, `r`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`. If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`. If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.**
