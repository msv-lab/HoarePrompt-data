The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `hLst`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the conditions on `h` remain unchanged, except that now `hLst` contains the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of n integers where each hi satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input**
