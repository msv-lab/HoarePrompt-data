To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(value_min, index_min)`, and the tuple that was just popped.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`.
- `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `t` is the index of the value in `hLst` corresponding to the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while t < i:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition `t < i` must be true for the loop to execute one more time.
- `t` is the index of the value in `hLst` corresponding to the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- `i` is `mI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than `i`.
- Since `i` is `mI + 1`, `t` must be less than `mI + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The state `t` must be less than `mI + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(value_min, index_min)`, and the tuple that was just popped, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`**
