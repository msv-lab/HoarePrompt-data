The code snippet `mI = t` assigns the value of `t` to the variable `mI`.

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is the first integer input
  - `k` is the second integer input
  - `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
  - `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
  - `j` is less than `n`
  - `m` is the value of `w`
  - `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
  - `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
  - `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
  - `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`
  - `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`
  - `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
  - `t` is the index of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
  - `t` is less than `mI + 1`
  - `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`
  - `prevJ` is the last index processed
  - `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`
  - `i` is `mI + 1`

- **Impact of the Code**:
  - `mI` is updated to the value of `t`.

- **Output State**:
  - `n` is the first integer input
  - `k` is the second integer input
  - `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
  - `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
  - `j` is less than `n`
  - `m` is the value of `w`
  - `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
  - `mI` is `t`
  - `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
  - `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`
  - `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`
  - `w` is the value of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
  - `t` is the index of the last element of the tuple popped from `q1`
  - `t` is less than `mI + 1`
  - `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`
  - `prevJ` is the last index processed
  - `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`
  - `i` is `mI + 1`
