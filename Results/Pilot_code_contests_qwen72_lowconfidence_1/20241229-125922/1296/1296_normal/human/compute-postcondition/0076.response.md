The code `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` pops the smallest tuple `(w, t)` from the heap `q1`. Given that `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`, this operation updates the values of `w` and `t` to the next smallest tuple in `q1`.

The initial state specifies that `q1` is a heap containing tuples `(w, t)` where `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, and `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

After executing the code, the values of `w` and `t` are updated to the next smallest tuple in `q1`, and `q1` no longer contains the smallest tuple `(w, t)` that was originally present.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the second smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the second smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
