To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `t < i`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is less than `mI + 1`
- `i` is `mI + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `t < i` must still hold true. Since `i` is set to `mI + 1`, `t` must be less than `mI + 1` for the loop to continue.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`t`**: The variable `t` must remain less than `i` for the loop to execute again. Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, `t` should be less than `mI + 1`.

2. **No other variables need to be adjusted**: The other variables (`n`, `k`, `h`, `hLst`, `j`, `m`, `M`, `mI`, `MI`, `q1`, `q2`, `w`, `prevJ`, `r`) do not directly affect the condition `t < i`. Therefore, they do not need to be modified to ensure the loop continues.

Thus, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `t` remains less than `i`.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, the element `(value_min, index_min)`, and the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`**
