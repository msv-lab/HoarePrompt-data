The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function should accept three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `h`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each element `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6.

Since the output of the function is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, typically, functions with such parameters might return a result based on some computation involving `n`, `k`, and the elements of `h`.

For the purpose of this task, we will assume that the function returns a result based on the input parameters without specifying the exact nature of the computation.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k`, an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^6; and `h`, a list of `n` integers where each element `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
