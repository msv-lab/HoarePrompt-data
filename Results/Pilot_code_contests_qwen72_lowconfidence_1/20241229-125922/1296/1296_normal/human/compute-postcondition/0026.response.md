The code `w = hLst[j]` assigns the value of `hLst[j]` to `w`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `w` is now set to `hLst[1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Here's the updated state:

- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `a` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `r` is an empty list
- `m` is `hLst[0]`
- `M` is `hLst[0]`
- `mI` is 0
- `MI` is 0
- `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`
- `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`
- `w` is `hLst[1]`
- `prevJ` is 0

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`, `mI` is 0, `MI` is 0, `q1` is a list containing the tuple `(hLst[0], 0)`, `q2` is a list containing the tuple `(-hLst[0], 0)`, `w` is `hLst[1]`, `prevJ` is 0**
