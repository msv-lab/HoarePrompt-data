To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while t < i:
```

This loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is less than `i`.

### Current State:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `j` is less than `n`.
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`.
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`.
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, minus the tuple that was just popped.
- `w` is the `-value` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `t` is the `index` part of the tuple popped from `q2`.
- `prevJ` is the last index processed.
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `mI` is not less than `MI`.
- `t` must be less than `i`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `t < i`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The current state indicates that `t` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute again.
- Since `i` is `MI + 1`, and `t` is the index part of the tuple popped from `q2`, we need to ensure that the next `t` value is still less than `i`.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustments are needed to the variables other than ensuring that the next `t` value remains less than `i`.
