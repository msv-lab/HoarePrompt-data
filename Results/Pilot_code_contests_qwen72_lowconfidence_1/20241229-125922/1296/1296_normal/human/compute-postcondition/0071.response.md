To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `t < i`. Let's break down the state and the condition:

- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `i` is `mI + 1`, where `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is `mI + 1`, this means `t` must be less than or equal to `mI`.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `i` is `mI + 1`.
- `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

Since `i` is `mI + 1`, for the condition `t < i` to hold true, `t` must be less than or equal to `mI`. This is because `t` being the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j` should naturally be within the range of indices considered, which includes `mI`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once, as the condition `t < i` should already be satisfied given the current state.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
