The code snippet `r = [(i + 1, j)]` creates a new list `r` containing a single tuple `(i + 1, j)`. This impacts the state of the variable `r` while leaving all other variables unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise
- `j` must be less than `n`
- `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`
- `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`
- `w` is the last value processed
- `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`
- `a` is `j - i`

After executing the code:
- `r` is assigned the value `[(i + 1, j)]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, `a` is `j - i`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`**
