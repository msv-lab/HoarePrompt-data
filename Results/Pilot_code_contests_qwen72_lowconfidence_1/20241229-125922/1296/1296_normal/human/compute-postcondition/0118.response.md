The code snippet `mI = j` updates the value of `mI` to be equal to `j`.

- `mI` was previously defined as the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- After the execution of the code, `mI` is now equal to `j`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is `w`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and includes the new tuple `(w, t)` if `j - i` is not equal to 1, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is `hLst[j]`, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`. If `j - i` > `a`, then `a` is updated to `j` and `r` is set to `[(1, j)]`. If `j - i` <= `a`, then `a` remains 0, and `r` is an empty list unless `j - i` equals `a`, in which case `r` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j)`. Additionally, the current value of `w` is less than or equal to the current value of `m`.**
