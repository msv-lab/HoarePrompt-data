The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q2)` updates the values of `w` and `t` by popping the smallest element (based on the first item in the tuple) from the heap `q2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is the second integer input
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input
- `j` is less than `n`
- `m` is the value of `w`
- `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `mI` is `t`
- `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`
- `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`
- `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`
- `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the elements in `q2`
- `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`
- `t` is less than `mI + 1`
- `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`
- `prevJ` is the last index processed
- `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`
- `i` is `mI + 1`
- `q2` is updated by removing the tuple `(-value, index)` with the highest `value` from it

After executing the code snippet:

- `w` is updated to the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`
- `t` is updated to the index of this highest value in `hLst`
- The tuple `(-value, index)` with the highest `value` is removed from `q2`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `j` is less than `n`, `m` is the value of `w`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `mI` is `t`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, `q1` contains the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the negated value of the highest value in `hLst` from the remaining elements in `q2`, `t` is the index of this highest value in `hLst`, `t` is less than `mI + 1`, `index_min` must be less than `mI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `r` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j)` if `j - i` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `j - i > a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is appended to the list `r`. If `j - i == a`, the tuple `(i + 1, j)` is also appended to the list `r`, `i` is `mI + 1`, `q2` is updated by removing the tuple `(-value, index)` with the highest `value` from it.**
