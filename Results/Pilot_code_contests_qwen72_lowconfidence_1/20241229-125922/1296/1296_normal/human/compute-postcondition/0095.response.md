To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `t < i`.

### Analysis:
- **`t`**: This is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- **`i`**: This is the current index in the iteration, specifically `MI + 1`.

The loop condition `t < i` means that the loop will continue as long as the index `t` (the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`) is less than `i` (which is `MI + 1`).

### Current State:
- `i` is `MI + 1`.
- `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than `i`. Given that `i` is `MI + 1`, the condition `t < i` simplifies to `t < MI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **No adjustments are needed** for the loop to execute one more time because the current state already satisfies the condition `t < i`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than `MI + 1`.

### Final State:
Since no adjustments are necessary, the state remains the same as the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the maximum value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` must be less than `MI + 1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and `mI` is not less than `MI`**.
