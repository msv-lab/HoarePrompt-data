The code snippet `heapq.heappush(q1, (w, t))` adds the tuple `(w, t)` to the heap `q1`. Given the initial state, `q1` already contains tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j`, but missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the tuple `(w, t)`. After executing the code, the tuple `(w, t)` is added to `q1`.

Therefore, the updated state of `q1` is that it now includes the tuple `(w, t)` in addition to its existing contents. The state of `q2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is equal to or greater than `i`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and including the tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to the last processed index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` and now includes the tuple `(w, t)`**
