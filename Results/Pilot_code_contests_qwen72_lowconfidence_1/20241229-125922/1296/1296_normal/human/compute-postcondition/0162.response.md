The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was already part of the condition `j must be less than n`, this increment affects its relation to `n` and potentially impacts the logic involving `w`, `M`, `MI`, `m`, `mI`, `q1`, and `q2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6.
- `hLst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `w` is `hLst[j]`.
- If `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j]`, `MI` is updated to `j`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j)`, `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j)`.
- If `prevJ != j`, then `prevJ` is updated to `j`.
- `j` must be less than `n`.
- `w` is `hLst[j]`. If `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `hLst[j]` and `mI` is updated to `j`.
- If `M - m > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing `j += 1`:
- The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged unless they depend on the updated value of `j`. Specifically:
- `w` will now be `hLst[j + 1]` (since `j` is now `j + 1`).
- The checks and updates involving `M`, `MI`, `m`, `mI`, `q1`, `q2`, and `prevJ` will be based on the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1 if `j - i` is equal to 1, otherwise `i` is either `mI + 1` if `mI < MI` or `MI + 1` otherwise, `j` is now `j + 1`, `w` is `hLst[j + 1]`, if `w >= M`, then `M` is updated to `hLst[j + 1]`, `MI` is updated to `j + 1`, `q1` includes the new tuple `(w, j + 1)`, `q2` includes the new tuple `(-w, j + 1)`, if `prevJ != j + 1`, then `prevJ` is updated to `j + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `w` is `hLst[j + 1]`. If `w <= m`, then `m` is updated to `hLst[j + 1]` and `mI` is updated to `j + 1`. If `M - m > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
