The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is `hLst[j]`, `M` is `hLst[j]`, `mI` is `j`, `MI` is `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the last value processed, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is equal to 0, `a` remains 0, and `r` is an empty list unless `j - i` equals `a`, in which case `r` contains the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.**
