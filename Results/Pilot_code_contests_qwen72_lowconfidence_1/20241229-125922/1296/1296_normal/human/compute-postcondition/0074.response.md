The code snippet `w, t = heapq.heappop(q1)` modifies the state by removing the smallest tuple `(w, t)` from the heap `q1`. This operation updates the values of `w` and `t` to the smallest tuple's value and index, respectively.

Given the initial state, the following variables are affected:

- `w` is updated to the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.
- `t` is updated to the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`.

The heap `q1` is modified by removing the smallest tuple, but since `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple, its exact state cannot be fully specified without knowing the contents of `q1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` is the index where the loop stopped and must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is now missing the smallest tuple `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `w` is the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `t` is the index of the smallest value in `hLst` up to index `j`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1, and the index of the minimum value `m` (`mI`) is less than the index of the maximum value `M` (`MI`)**.
