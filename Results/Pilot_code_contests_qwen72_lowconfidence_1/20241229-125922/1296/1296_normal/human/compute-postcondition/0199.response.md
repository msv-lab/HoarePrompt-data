To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

### Analysis:
- The condition `t < i` means that the index `t` of the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j` must be less than `i` for the loop to continue.
- Given that `t` is the index of the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j`, and `i` is `MI + 1`, we need to ensure that `t` remains less than `i` for the loop to execute again.

### Current State:
- `t` is the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j`, and `t` must be less than `i`.
- `i` is `MI + 1`, and `t` must be less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be less than `i`. Since `i` is `MI + 1`, we need to ensure that the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j` has an index `t` that is less than `i`.
- This implies that the values in `hLst` from index `i` to `j` must be such that the largest value among them has an index `t` that is less than `i`.

### Conclusion:
- No specific adjustments are needed to the state variables themselves, as the condition `t < i` is already satisfied by the current state. The loop will continue as long as `t` remains less than `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `MI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i` (excluding the tuple that was just extracted), `w` is the largest value in `hLst` from index `i` to `j`, `t` is the index of this largest value in `hLst` and must be less than `i`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is not less than `MI` (i.e., `mI >= MI`), and if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`. If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.**
