The code assigns the first element of the list `hLst` to both `m` and `M`. Since `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, the value of `m` and `M` will be the first integer in this list.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of n integers where each hi satisfies 1 ≤ hi ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `m` is `hLst[0]`, `M` is `hLst[0]`**
