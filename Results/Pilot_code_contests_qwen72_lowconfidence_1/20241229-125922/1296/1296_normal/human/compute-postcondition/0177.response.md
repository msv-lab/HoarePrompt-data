To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `t < i`.

### Analysis:
- The current state indicates that `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is less than `i`.
- Since `i` is defined as `mI + 1`, the loop will stop executing when `t` reaches or exceeds `mI + 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be less than `i`.
- Given that `t` must be less than `mI + 1`, no adjustments are necessary if `t` is already less than `mI + 1`.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `t < i` is already satisfied (as `t` must be less than `mI + 1`), no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `mI + 1`, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is the minimum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `M` is the maximum value encountered in `hLst` up to index `j`, `mI` is the index of the minimum value `m` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `MI` is the index of the maximum value `M` in `hLst` up to index `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i` and the element `(w, t)`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the value of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `t` is the index of the first element of the tuple popped from `q1`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`, if `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`, if `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`, and `t` must be less than `mI + 1`**
