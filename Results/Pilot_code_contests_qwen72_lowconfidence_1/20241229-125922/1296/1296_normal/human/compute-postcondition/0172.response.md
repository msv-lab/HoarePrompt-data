The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `h` is a list of `n` integers where each `hi` satisfies 1 ≤ `hi` ≤ 10^6, `hLst` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is increased by 1, `j` must be less than `n`, `m` is `hLst[j]`, `M` is `hLst[j]`, `mI` is `j`, `MI` is `j`, `q1` is a list of tuples `(value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but now missing all elements with indices less than `i`, `q2` is a list of tuples `(-value, index)` for each value in `hLst` up to index `j` but only contains elements with indices greater than or equal to `i`, `w` is the last value processed, `t` is the index of this value in `hLst` and is equal to `i - 1` if `mI >= MI`, `prevJ` is the last index processed, `j - i` is not equal to 1 if the else part is executed, and `mI` is less than `MI` if the if part is executed, otherwise `mI` is not less than `MI`. If `j - i` is greater than `a`, `r` is `[(i + 1, j)]`. If `j - i` is equal to `a`, `r` includes the tuple `(i + 1, j)`.
