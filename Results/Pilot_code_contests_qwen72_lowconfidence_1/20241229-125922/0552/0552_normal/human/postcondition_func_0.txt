The function `func_1(k, n, s)` takes three parameters: `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and `s` (a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z'). The function returns 'Yes' if at any point during the traversal of the string `s`, the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences in `s` reaches `k`. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function initializes two dictionaries, `count1` and `count2`, to count the occurrences of each character in `s`. `count1` stores the total occurrences of each character in `s`, while `count2` tracks the current count of each character as the string is traversed. The variable `NumOfOpenGates` keeps track of the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences. If `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k` at any point, the function immediately returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function returns 'No'. Edge cases include when `k` is 1 or equal to the number of distinct characters in `s`, and when `s` contains repeated characters.
