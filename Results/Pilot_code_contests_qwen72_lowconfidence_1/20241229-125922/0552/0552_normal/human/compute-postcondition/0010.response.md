Output State: **`k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary with `count1[ch] = 0`, `count2` is a dictionary with `count2[ch] = 0`, `ch` is the next character in `alphabet` after the current `ch`.** 

(Note: The code snippet `count1[ch] = 0` does not change the state because `count1[ch]` was already initialized to 0 in the initial state.)
