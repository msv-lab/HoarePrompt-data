Output State: **`k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary where `count1[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet`, `count2` is a dictionary where `count2[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet` (same as `count1[ch]`), `NumOfOpenGates` is the number of distinct characters in `s` that appear fewer than `count1[ch]` times. If at any point during the loop `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k`, the function returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function does not return 'Yes'.**
