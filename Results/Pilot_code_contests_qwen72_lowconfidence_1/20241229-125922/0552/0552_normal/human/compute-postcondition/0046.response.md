Postcondition: ***`k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z' and must have at least three characters, `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary where `count1[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet`, `count2` is a dictionary with `count2[ch] = 1` for the first character `ch` of `s`, `count2[ch] = 1` for the second character `ch` of `s`, and `count2[ch] = 0` for each other `ch` in `alphabet`, `ch` is the third character of `s`. If `count2[ch]` is 0, `NumOfOpenGates` is 1. If `count2[ch]` equals `count1[ch] - 1` and `NumOfOpenGates` was initially 1, it is now 0. The program does not return anything specific.***
