The code initializes a variable `alphabet` with the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`. This does not change the values of `k`, `n`, or `s`, which remain as specified in the initial state. 

Output State: **`k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
