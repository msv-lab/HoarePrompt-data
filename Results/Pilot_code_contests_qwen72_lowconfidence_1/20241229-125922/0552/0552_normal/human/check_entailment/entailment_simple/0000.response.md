Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Door Openings and Closings:**
   - The program uses `count1` to store the total number of occurrences of each character in the string `s`, and `count2` to keep track of how many times each character has been encountered so far.
   - The variable `NumOfOpenGates` is used to count the number of currently open gates. However, the logic for opening and closing gates is flawed.

2. **Flawed Logic for Opening Gates:**
   - The program increments `NumOfOpenGates` when a gate is opened (i.e., when `count2[ch] == 0`). This is correct.
   - However, the program decrements `NumOfOpenGates` when `count2[ch]` reaches `count1[ch] - 1`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the gate should close immediately after the second-to-last occurrence of the character. In reality, the gate should close after the last occurrence of the character.

3. **Incorrect Return Value:**
   - The program returns `'Yes'` if `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k` at any point, which is correct. However, it should return `'YES'` (as specified in the problem description).
   - Similarly, it returns `'No'` at the end, but it should return `'NO'`.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is a corrected version of the program that adheres to the problem description:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
s = input()

def func_1(k, n, s):
    count1 = {}
    count2 = {}
    for ch in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ':
        count1[ch] = 0
        count2[ch] = 0

    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1

    NumOfOpenGates = 0
    for ch in s:
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            if NumOfOpenGates == k:
                return 'YES'
            NumOfOpenGates += 1

        count2[ch] += 1

        if count2[ch] == count1[ch]:
            NumOfOpenGates -= 1

    return 'NO'

print(func_1(k, n, s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization:** Initialize `count1` and `count2` to count the occurrences of each character.
- **Count Occurrences:** Count the total occurrences of each character in `s` using `count1`.
- **Track Open Gates:** As guests arrive, increment `NumOfOpenGates` when a new gate is opened.
- **Close Gates:** Decrement `NumOfOpenGates` when the last guest for a particular gate arrives.
- **Check Guards:** If at any point `NumOfOpenGates` exceeds `k`, return `'YES'`.
- **Final Return:** If the loop completes without exceeding `k` open gates, return `'NO'`.

This corrected implementation ensures that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
