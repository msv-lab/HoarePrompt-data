You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: <image>

It's the end of July – the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly Castle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.

There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.

For an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.

Slastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened.

Input

Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the number of guards k (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).

In the second string, n uppercase English letters s1s2... sn are given, where si is the entrance used by the i-th guest.

Output

Output «YES» if at least one door was unguarded during some time, and «NO» otherwise.

You can output each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 1
AABBB


Output

NO


Input

5 1
ABABB


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample case, the door A is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle. The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened.

In the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door. 
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
s = raw_input()
print(func_1(k, n, s))

def func_1(k, n, s):
    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    count1 = {}
    count2 = {}
    for ch in alphabet:
        count1[ch] = 0
        count2[ch] = 0
    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1
    NumOfOpenGates = 0
    for ch in s:
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            if NumOfOpenGates == k:
                return 'Yes'
            NumOfOpenGates += 1
        if count2[ch] == count1[ch] - 1:
            NumOfOpenGates -= 1
        count2[ch] += 1
    return 'No'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if there was a moment when more than `k` doors were open, thus leaving some doors unguarded. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes two dictionaries, `count1` and `count2`, to keep track of the total number of guests entering through each door and the current number of guests who have entered through each door, respectively.

2. **Counting Total Guests per Door**: The first loop iterates through the string `s` and updates `count1` to store the total number of guests for each door.

3. **Tracking Open Doors**: The second loop iterates through the string `s` again to simulate the guests entering the castle. For each guest:
   - It checks if the door is being opened for the first time (`count2[ch] == 0`). If so, it increments the number of open doors (`NumOfOpenGates`).
   - It checks if the door is being closed (`count2[ch] == count1[ch] - 1`). If so, it decrements the number of open doors (`NumOfOpenGates`).
   - It increments the count of guests for the current door in `count2`.

4. **Guard Check**: During the simulation, if the number of open doors exceeds the number of guards (`NumOfOpenGates > k`), the function immediately returns 'Yes', indicating that at least one door was unguarded.

5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding a moment when more than `k` doors were open, the function returns 'No'.

This implementation correctly handles the constraints and edge cases described in the problem. It ensures that the number of open doors is tracked accurately and that the guards' availability is checked at each step. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1(k, n, s)` takes three parameters: `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and `s` (a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z'). The function returns 'Yes' if at any point during the traversal of the string `s`, the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences in `s` reaches `k`. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function initializes two dictionaries, `count1` and `count2`, to count the occurrences of each character in `s`. `count1` stores the total occurrences of each character in `s`, while `count2` tracks the current count of each character as the string is traversed. The variable `NumOfOpenGates` keeps track of the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences. If `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k` at any point, the function immediately returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function returns 'No'. Edge cases include when `k` is 1 or equal to the number of distinct characters in `s`, and when `s` contains repeated characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
