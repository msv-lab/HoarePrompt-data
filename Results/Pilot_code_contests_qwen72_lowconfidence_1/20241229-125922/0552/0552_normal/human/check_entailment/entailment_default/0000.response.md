Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code handles the opening and closing of doors and the counting of open gates.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Open Gates**:
   - The code uses `NumOfOpenGates` to keep track of the number of open gates. However, it increments `NumOfOpenGates` every time a new character (entrance) is encountered that hasn't been seen before (`if count2[ch] == 0`).
   - It decrements `NumOfOpenGates` when the current count of a character reaches one less than its total count (`if count2[ch] == count1[ch] - 1`).
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't accurately reflect the state of the doors. A door should be considered open from the first occurrence of a character until the last occurrence of that character.

2. **Edge Case Failure**:
   - Consider the input `(5, 1, "ABABB")`. The correct output should be "YES" because at some point, both doors A and B are open, but there is only one guard.
   - However, the code will incorrectly return "NO" because it doesn't correctly manage the state of the doors.

To fix the code, we need to ensure that a door is only considered open from the first to the last occurrence of a character. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(k, n, s):
    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    count1 = {ch: 0 for ch in alphabet}
    count2 = {ch: 0 for ch in alphabet}
    
    # Count the total occurrences of each character
    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1
    
    NumOfOpenGates = 0
    for ch in s:
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            NumOfOpenGates += 1
        count2[ch] += 1
        if count2[ch] == count1[ch]:
            NumOfOpenGates -= 1
        if NumOfOpenGates > k:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

This corrected version ensures that a door is only counted as open when it is first encountered and remains open until the last occurrence of the character. This way, the number of open gates is accurately tracked, and the function correctly determines if there is a moment when more than `k` doors are open.
