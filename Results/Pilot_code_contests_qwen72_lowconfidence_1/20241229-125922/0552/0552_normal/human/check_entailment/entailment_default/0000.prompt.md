You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: <image>

It's the end of July – the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly Castle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.

There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.

For an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.

Slastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened.

Input

Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the number of guards k (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).

In the second string, n uppercase English letters s1s2... sn are given, where si is the entrance used by the i-th guest.

Output

Output «YES» if at least one door was unguarded during some time, and «NO» otherwise.

You can output each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 1
AABBB


Output

NO


Input

5 1
ABABB


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample case, the door A is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle. The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened.

In the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door. 
Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
s = raw_input()
print(func_1(k, n, s))

def func_1(k, n, s):
    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    count1 = {}
    count2 = {}
    for ch in alphabet:
        count1[ch] = 0
        count2[ch] = 0
    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1
    NumOfOpenGates = 0
    for ch in s:
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            if NumOfOpenGates == k:
                return 'Yes'
            NumOfOpenGates += 1
        if count2[ch] == count1[ch] - 1:
            NumOfOpenGates -= 1
        count2[ch] += 1
    return 'No'


```
Output hints: The function `func_1(k, n, s)` takes three parameters: `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and `s` (a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z'). The function returns 'Yes' if at any point during the traversal of the string `s`, the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences in `s` reaches `k`. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function initializes two dictionaries, `count1` and `count2`, to count the occurrences of each character in `s`. `count1` stores the total occurrences of each character in `s`, while `count2` tracks the current count of each character as the string is traversed. The variable `NumOfOpenGates` keeps track of the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences. If `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k` at any point, the function immediately returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function returns 'No'. Edge cases include when `k` is 1 or equal to the number of distinct characters in `s`, and when `s` contains repeated characters.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
