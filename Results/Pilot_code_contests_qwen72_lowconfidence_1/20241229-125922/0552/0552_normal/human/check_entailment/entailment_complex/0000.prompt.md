You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: <image>

It's the end of July – the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly Castle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in the world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not supposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause discord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong hands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in.

There are 26 entrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to Z. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an entrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the arrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance. No two guests can enter the castle simultaneously.

For an entrance to be protected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it. There are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened doors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't leave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed.

Slastyona had a suspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the order in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help her check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened.

Input

Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the number of guards k (1 ≤ n ≤ 106, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26).

In the second string, n uppercase English letters s1s2... sn are given, where si is the entrance used by the i-th guest.

Output

Output «YES» if at least one door was unguarded during some time, and «NO» otherwise.

You can output each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

5 1
AABBB


Output

NO


Input

5 1
ABABB


Output

YES

Note

In the first sample case, the door A is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle. The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened.

In the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
s = raw_input()
print(func_1(k, n, s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z'.
def func_1(k, n, s):
    alphabet = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    count1 = {}
    count2 = {}
    for ch in alphabet:
        count1[ch] = 0
        
        count2[ch] = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary with `count1[ch] = 0` for each `ch` in `alphabet`, `count2` is a dictionary with `count2[ch] = 0` for each `ch` in `alphabet`.
    for ch in s:
        count1[ch] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary where `count1[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet`, `count2` is a dictionary with `count2[ch] = 0` for each `ch` in `alphabet`.
    NumOfOpenGates = 0
    for ch in s:
        if count2[ch] == 0:
            if NumOfOpenGates == k:
                return 'Yes'
            NumOfOpenGates += 1
        
        if count2[ch] == count1[ch] - 1:
            NumOfOpenGates -= 1
        
        count2[ch] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `s` is a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z', `alphabet` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `count1` is a dictionary where `count1[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet`, `count2` is a dictionary where `count2[ch]` is the number of occurrences of character `ch` in `s` for each `ch` in `alphabet` (same as `count1[ch]`), `NumOfOpenGates` is the number of distinct characters in `s` that appear fewer than `count1[ch]` times. If at any point during the loop `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k`, the function returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function does not return 'Yes'.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1(k, n, s)` takes three parameters: `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and `s` (a string of length n consisting of uppercase English letters from 'A' to 'Z'). The function returns 'Yes' if at any point during the traversal of the string `s`, the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences in `s` reaches `k`. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. The function initializes two dictionaries, `count1` and `count2`, to count the occurrences of each character in `s`. `count1` stores the total occurrences of each character in `s`, while `count2` tracks the current count of each character as the string is traversed. The variable `NumOfOpenGates` keeps track of the number of distinct characters that have appeared fewer than their total occurrences. If `NumOfOpenGates` equals `k` at any point, the function immediately returns 'Yes'. If the loop completes without `NumOfOpenGates` ever reaching `k`, the function returns 'No'. Edge cases include when `k` is 1 or equal to the number of distinct characters in `s`, and when `s` contains repeated characters.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
