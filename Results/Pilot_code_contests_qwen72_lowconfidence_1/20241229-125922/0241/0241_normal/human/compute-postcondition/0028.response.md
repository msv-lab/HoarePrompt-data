The code snippet assigns the difference in the y-coordinates of `p2` and `p1` to the variable `py`. Given that `p1` is `points[0]` and `p2` is `points[1 % n]`, which simplifies to `points[1]` (since `1 % n` is 1 for any `n > 0`), the value of `py` is calculated as `p2[1] - p1[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1]`, `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`, `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`**
