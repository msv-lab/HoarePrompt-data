The code snippet assigns the value of `distance` to the variable `minD`. The value of `distance` is calculated as `(dx * dx + dy * dy)`, where `dx` is `x1 - x` and `dy` is `y1 - y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[1]`
- `p2` is `points[2]`
- `px` is `points[2][0] - points[1][0]`
- `py` is `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`
- `u` is the value of `u` after being checked
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`
- `dx` is `x1 - x`
- `dy` is `y1 - y`
- `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\)

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `minD` is now equal to `distance`.
