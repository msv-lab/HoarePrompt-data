The given Python code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the point `points[i]`. The result is stored in the variable `distance`.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon
- `maxD` is 10000000
- `minD` remains unchanged unless `distance` < `minD` in the loop body

The code snippet:
```python
distance = (abs(x - points[i][0]) ** 2 + abs(y - points[i][1]) ** 2) ** (1 / 2.0)
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. The variable `distance` is calculated using the formula for the Euclidean distance between two points `(x, y)` and `points[i]`.
2. The specific calculation involves:
   - `x - points[i][0]`: This computes the difference in the x-coordinates.
   - `y - points[i][1]`: This computes the difference in the y-coordinates.
   - `abs(x - points[i][0]) ** 2`: This computes the square of the absolute difference in the x-coordinates.
   - `abs(y - points[i][1]) ** 2`: This computes the square of the absolute difference in the y-coordinates.
   - The sum of these squared differences is then taken.
   - The square root of this sum is computed to get the Euclidean distance.

The final value of `distance` is:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2} \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 10000000, `minD` remains unchanged unless `distance` < `minD` in the loop body, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\)**
