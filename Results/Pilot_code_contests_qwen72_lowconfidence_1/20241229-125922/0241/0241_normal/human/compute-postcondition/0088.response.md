Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, consisting of the number of vertices of a polygon \( n \), the coordinates of a point \( P(x, y) \), and the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. It calculates the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. The function then computes the areas of the circles with radii equal to these minimum and maximum distances, respectively, and outputs the difference between these areas to standard output. The function does not return a boolean value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon; instead, it focuses on calculating and printing the area difference. If \( n \) is 0, the function assumes no vertices and sets the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, resulting in a negative area difference being printed. **
