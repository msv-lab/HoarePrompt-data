The code snippet calculates the value of `maxA` by squaring `maxD` and multiplying it by \( \pi \). The value of `pi` is assumed to be a predefined constant (e.g., approximately 3.14159).

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `r` is `stdin.readline`.
- `w` is `stdout.write`.
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
- If `n` is 0, `maxD` remains 0 and `minD` remains 10000000.
- If `n` is greater than 0, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, and `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon.
- `minA` is \( \pi \times \text{minD}^2 \).

After executing the code snippet:
- `maxA` is now calculated as \( \pi \times \text{maxD}^2 \).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, if `n` is 0, `maxD` is 0 and `minD` is 10000000, if `n` is greater than 0, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, and `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, `minA` is \( \pi \times \text{minD}^2 \), `maxA` is \( \pi \times \text{maxD}^2 \)**.
