The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the first point in the `points` list, which is `points[0]`. This distance is stored in the variable `distance`.

- The value of `distance` is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{distance} = \left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}
  \]
- The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `maxD`, and `minD` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 0, `minD` is 10000000, `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)**
