The code snippet `py = p2[1] - p1[1]` updates the value of `py`. Initially, `py` was defined as `points[3][1] - points[2][1]`, but now it is updated to `p2[1] - p1[1]`. Since `p2` is `points[3]` and `p1` is `points[2]`, the new value of `py` is the same as the original definition, so no actual change in value occurs. However, for the sake of clarity and adherence to the format, we will state the output state explicitly.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon, `p1` is `points[2]`, `p2` is `points[3]`, `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`, `py` is `p2[1] - p1[1]`, `u` is the value of `u` after being checked, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`, `dx` is `x1 - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\)**
