The code snippet `maxD = distance` updates the value of `maxD` to the current value of `distance`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `maxD` is updated to the value of `distance`.
   - `distance` is the previously calculated Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the point `(x1, y1)`.

2. **Update:**
   - The variable `maxD` is set to the value of `distance`.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy) ** 0.5\), `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[1]`, `p2` is `points[2]`, `px` is `points[2][0] - points[1][0]`, `py` is `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`, `u` is the value of `u` after being checked, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`, `dx` is `x1 - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, and `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy) ** 0.5\). If `distance` is less than `minD`, then `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.**
