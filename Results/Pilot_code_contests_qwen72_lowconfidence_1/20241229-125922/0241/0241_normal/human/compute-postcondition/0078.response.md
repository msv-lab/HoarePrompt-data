The code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between the point \( (x, y) \) and another point \( (x1, y1) \). The distance is stored in the variable `distance`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[2]`
- `p2` is `points[3]`
- `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`
- `py` is `p2[1] - p1[1]`
- if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * px`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`
- `dx` is `(p1[0] + u * px) - x`
- `dy` is `(p1[1] + u * py) - y`

The code snippet:
```
distance = (dx * dx + dy * dy) ** 0.5
```

Calculates the Euclidean distance using the formula:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{(dx * dx + dy * dy)} \]

The new value of `distance` is:
\[ \text{distance} = \sqrt{((p1[0] + u * px) - x)^2 + ((p1[1] + u * py) - y)^2} \]

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon, `p1` is `points[2]`, `p2` is `points[3]`, `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`, `py` is `p2[1] - p1[1]`, if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * px`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`, `dx` is `(p1[0] + u * px) - x`, `dy` is `(p1[1] + u * py) - y`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{((p1[0] + u * px) - x)^2 + ((p1[1] + u * py) - y)^2}\)**
