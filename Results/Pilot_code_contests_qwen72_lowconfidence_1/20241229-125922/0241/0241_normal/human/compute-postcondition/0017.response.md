Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 10000000. If `distance` < `minD`, `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.***
