The code assigns the first element of the `points` list to `p1` and the second element (or the first element again if `i` is the last index) to `p2`. Given that `i` is 0, `p1` will be the first tuple in `points`, and `p2` will be the second tuple in `points`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1 % n]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1 % n]`.**
