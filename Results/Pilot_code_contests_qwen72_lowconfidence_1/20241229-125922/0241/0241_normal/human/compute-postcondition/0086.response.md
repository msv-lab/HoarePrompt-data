The code `w(str(maxA - minA))` writes the difference between `maxA` and `minA` to the standard output. The values of `maxA` and `minA` are calculated based on the given conditions in the initial state.

Given:
- `maxA` is \( \pi \times \text{maxD}^2 \)
- `minA` is \( \pi \times \text{minD}^2 \)

The difference `maxA - minA` is:
\[ \pi \times \text{maxD}^2 - \pi \times \text{minD}^2 = \pi (\text{maxD}^2 - \text{minD}^2) \]

The code writes this difference to the standard output using `w`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, if `n` is 0, `maxD` is 0 and `minD` is 10000000, if `n` is greater than 0, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, and `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, `minA` is \( \pi \times \text{minD}^2 \), `maxA` is \( \pi \times \text{maxD}^2 \), the value \( \pi (\text{maxD}^2 - \text{minD}^2) \) has been written to the standard output.**
