Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `minD` is 10000000, and `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\). If `distance` > `maxD`, `maxD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `maxD` remains unchanged.***
