Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 10000000 or \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\) if `distance` > `maxD`, `minD` remains unchanged unless `distance` < `minD` in the loop body, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\).***
