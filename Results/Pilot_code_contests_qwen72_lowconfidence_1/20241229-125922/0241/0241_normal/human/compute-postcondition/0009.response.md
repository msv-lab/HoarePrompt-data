Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `minD` is 10000000, `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\), `maxD` is the maximum value between the initial `maxD` and `distance`. Additionally, the current value of `distance` is less than `minD`.***
