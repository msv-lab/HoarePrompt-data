The code initializes two variables, `maxD` and `minD`, setting `maxD` to 0 and `minD` to 10000000. The initial values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, and `points` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, the point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 0, `minD` is 10000000**
