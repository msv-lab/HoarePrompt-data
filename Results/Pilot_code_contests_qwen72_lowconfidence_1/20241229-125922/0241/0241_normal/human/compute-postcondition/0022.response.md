The code snippet sets `minD` to the value of `distance`. The value of `distance` is calculated as \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\), which is the Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the point at index `i` in the `points` list.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `minD` is set to the value of `distance`, which is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[2][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[2][1])^2}\).
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 10000000 or \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[2][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[2][1])^2}\) if `distance` > `maxD`, `minD` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[2][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[2][1])^2}\), `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[2][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[2][1])^2}\)**
