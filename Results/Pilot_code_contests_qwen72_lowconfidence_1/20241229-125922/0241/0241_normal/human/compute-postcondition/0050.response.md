The code snippet `py = p2[1] - p1[1]` updates the value of `py` to the difference between the y-coordinates of `p2` and `p1`. Given the initial state, let's list the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and calculate the result:

- `py` is updated to `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `maxD`, `minD`, `p1`, `p2`, `px`, `u`, `x1`, `y1`, `dx`, `dy`, `distance`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[1]`, `p2` is `points[2]`, `px` is `points[2][0] - points[1][0]`, `py` is `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`, if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`, `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0]) - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(points[1][0] + u * px - x)^2 + (y1 - y)^2}\). If `distance` is less than `minD`, then `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.**
