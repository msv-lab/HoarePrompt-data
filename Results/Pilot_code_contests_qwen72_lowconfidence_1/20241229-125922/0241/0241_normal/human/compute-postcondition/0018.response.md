To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `r` is `stdin.readline`.
- `w` is `stdout.write`.
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
- `maxD` is 10000000.
- If `distance` < `minD`, `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again, so `n` must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `maxD`, and `minD`) do not change based on the loop condition alone.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 10000000, `minD` remains unchanged unless `distance` < `minD` in the loop body.**
