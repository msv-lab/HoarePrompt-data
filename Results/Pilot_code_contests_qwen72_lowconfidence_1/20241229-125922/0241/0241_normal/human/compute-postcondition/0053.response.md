Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[1]`, `p2` is `points[2]`, `px` is `points[2][0] - points[1][0]`, `py` is `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`. If `u > 1`, then `u` is set to 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + 1 * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + 1 * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`, `dx` is `p1[0] + 1 * (points[2][0] - points[1][0]) - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, and `distance` is \(\sqrt{(points[1][0] + 1 * px - x)^2 + (y1 - y)^2}\). If `distance` is less than `minD`, then `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged. If `u <= 1`, `u` retains its original value calculated by the formula, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`, `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0]) - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, and `distance` is \(\sqrt{(points[1][0] + u * px - x)^2 + (y1 - y)^2}\). If `distance` is less than `minD`, then `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.***
