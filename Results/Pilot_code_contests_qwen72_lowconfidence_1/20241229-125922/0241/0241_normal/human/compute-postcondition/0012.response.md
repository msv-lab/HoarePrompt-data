To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- **`n`**: Must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: Is 0.
- **`x`**: Is the second integer from the input.
- **`y`**: Is the third integer from the input.
- **`r`**: Is `stdin.readline`.
- **`w`**: Is `stdout.write`.
- **`points`**: Is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
- **`minD`**: Is initially 10000000.
- **`distance`**: Is calculated as \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\).
- **`maxD`**: Is the maximum value between the initial `maxD` and `distance`.
- **`minD`**: Is updated to `distance` if `distance` is less than `minD`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `minD`, `maxD`, and `distance` remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume these values are not changed.

### Adjusted State:
- **`i`**: Will be incremented to 1.
- **`n`**: Must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `minD` is 10000000, `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\), `maxD` is the maximum value between the initial `maxD` and `distance`. If `distance` < `minD`, then `minD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `minD` remains unchanged.**
