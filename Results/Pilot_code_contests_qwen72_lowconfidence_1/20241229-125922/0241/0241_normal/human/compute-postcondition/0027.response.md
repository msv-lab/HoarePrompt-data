The code snippet `px = p2[0] - p1[0]` calculates the difference between the x-coordinates of the points `p2` and `p1`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[0]`
- `p2` is `points[1 % n]`

The calculation of `px` involves subtracting the x-coordinate of `p1` from the x-coordinate of `p2`. Since `p1` is `points[0]` and `p2` is `points[1 % n]` (which simplifies to `points[1]` because `1 % n` is 1 for any `n > 1`), `px` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the first and second points in the `points` list.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[0]`
- `p2` is `points[1 % n]`
- `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1 % n]`, `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`**
