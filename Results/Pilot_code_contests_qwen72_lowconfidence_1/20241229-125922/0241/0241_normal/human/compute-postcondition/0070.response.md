The value of `u` is updated to 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon, `p1` is `points[2]`, `p2` is `points[3]`, `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`, `py` is `p2[1] - p1[1]`, `u` is 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`, `dx` is `x1 - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\)**
