The line of code updates the value of `dy` to `y1 - y`. Since `y1` is defined as `p1[1] + u * py`, the new value of `dy` is calculated as `(p1[1] + u * py) - y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon, `p1` is `points[2]`, `p2` is `points[3]`, `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`, `py` is `p2[1] - p1[1]`, if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * px`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`, `dx` is `(p1[0] + u * px) - x`, `dy` is `(p1[1] + u * py) - y`, and `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\).
