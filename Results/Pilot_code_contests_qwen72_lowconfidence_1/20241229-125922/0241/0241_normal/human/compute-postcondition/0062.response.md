Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[1]`, `p2` is `points[2]`, `px` is `points[2][0] - points[1][0]`, `py` is `points[2][1] - points[1][1]`, `u` is the value of `u` after being checked, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[2][0] - points[1][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[2][1] - points[1][1])`, `dx` is `x1 - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, and `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy) ** 0.5\). If `distance` is greater than `maxD`, then `maxD` is updated to `distance`. Otherwise, `maxD` remains unchanged.***
