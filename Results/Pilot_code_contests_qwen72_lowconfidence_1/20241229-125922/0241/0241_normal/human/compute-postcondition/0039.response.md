The code snippet `dy = y1 - y` calculates the difference between `y1` and `y` and assigns the result to `dy`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[0]`
- `p2` is `points[1]`
- `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`
- `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`
- if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`
- `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) - x`

The new variable `dy` is calculated as:
- `dy = y1 - y`

Therefore, the updated state includes:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[0]`
- `p2` is `points[1]`
- `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`
- `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`
- if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`
- `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) - x`
- `dy` is `y1 - y`

Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`, `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`**
