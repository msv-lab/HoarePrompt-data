The code snippet calculates the difference between `x1` and `x` and assigns this difference to the variable `dx`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[0]`
- `p2` is `points[1]`
- `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`
- `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`
- If `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`

The code snippet:
```python
dx = x1 - x
```

Impact:
- `dx` is assigned the value of `x1 - x`.

Since `x1` is defined as `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`, and `x` is the second integer from the input, `dx` is calculated as:
- `dx = p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) - x`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1]`, `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`, `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`, if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * py`, `dx` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0]) - x`**
