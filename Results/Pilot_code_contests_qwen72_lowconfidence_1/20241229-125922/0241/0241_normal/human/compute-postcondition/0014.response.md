The value of `maxD` is updated to the current value of `distance`. The initial state specifies that `maxD` was initially set to the maximum value between the original `maxD` and the initial `distance`. Now, `maxD` is explicitly set to the current `distance`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `minD` is 10000000, `maxD` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\), `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)**
