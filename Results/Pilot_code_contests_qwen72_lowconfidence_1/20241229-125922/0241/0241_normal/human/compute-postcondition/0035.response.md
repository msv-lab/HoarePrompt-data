Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1]`, `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`, `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`. If `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1.***
