To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

- The for loop is defined as `for i in xrange(n):`.
- This means the loop will iterate `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `n`**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized by the for loop itself and will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `maxD`, `minD`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but may be used within the loop body. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

### Adjusted State:

- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is 0, `minD` is 10000000**
