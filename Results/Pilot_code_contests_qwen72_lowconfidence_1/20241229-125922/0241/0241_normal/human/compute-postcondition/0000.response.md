The code snippet assigns the functions `stdin.readline` to the variable `r` and `stdout.write` to the variable `w`. This does not change the values of any variables related to the polygon's vertices, the coordinates of point \( P \), or the conditions regarding the input and output constraints. The only changes are the assignments of the functions to `r` and `w`.

Output State: **The function should take as input the number of vertices of the polygon \( n \), and the coordinates of point \( P \) (x, y). Additionally, it should take \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. All coordinates are integers and do not exceed 1,000,000 in absolute value. The point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon. `r` is now `stdin.readline`, `w` is now `stdout.write`.**
