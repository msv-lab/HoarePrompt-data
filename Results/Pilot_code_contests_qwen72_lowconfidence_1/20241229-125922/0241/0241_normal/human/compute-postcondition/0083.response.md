Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. If `n` is 0, `maxD` remains 0 and `minD` remains 10000000. If `n` is greater than 0, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, and `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon.**
