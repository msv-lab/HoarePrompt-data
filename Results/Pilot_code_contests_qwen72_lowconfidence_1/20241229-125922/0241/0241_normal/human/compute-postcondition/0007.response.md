The code snippet updates the value of `maxD` to be equal to the value of `distance`. Given the initial state, the value of `distance` is calculated as \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\), and it is stated that `distance` is greater than `maxD`. Therefore, after executing the code, `maxD` now holds the value of `distance`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\), `minD` is 10000000, `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)**
