The code reads from `stdin` using `r()`, which is defined as `stdin.readline`, and splits the input into three parts. These parts are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting values are assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- The function should take as input the number of vertices of the polygon \( n \), and the coordinates of point \( P \) (x, y).
- Additionally, it should take \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.
- All coordinates are integers and do not exceed 1,000,000 in absolute value.
- The point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon.
- `r` is now `stdin.readline`, `w` is now `stdout.write`.

After executing the code:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `y` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The rest of the preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, the point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, and the function should take \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order, with all coordinates being integers and not exceeding 1,000,000 in absolute value.**
