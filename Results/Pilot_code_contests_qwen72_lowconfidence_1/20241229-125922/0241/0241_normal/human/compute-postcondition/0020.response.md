The code snippet:
```python
maxD = distance
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. The variable `maxD` is updated to the value of `distance`.
2. The value of `distance` was previously calculated as \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `maxD` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\), `minD` remains unchanged unless `distance` < `minD` in the loop body, `distance` is \(\sqrt{(x - \text{points}[i][0])^2 + (y - \text{points}[i][1])^2}\)**
