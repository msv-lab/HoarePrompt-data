The code reads `n` lines from the standard input (`r`), where each line contains two integers separated by spaces. These integers are mapped to the `int` type and collected into a list of tuples called `points`. Each tuple represents the coordinates of a vertex of the polygon.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- The point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon.
- `r` is `stdin.readline`.
- `w` is `stdout.write`.

After executing the code:
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The point \( P \) still lies strictly outside the polygon.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, the point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon.**
