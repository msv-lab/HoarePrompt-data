The code snippet calculates the Euclidean distance between the point `(x, y)` and the point at index `i` in the `points` list, which is initially set to 1. The new distance is stored in the variable `distance`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon
- `minD` is 10000000
- `distance` is initially calculated as \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[0][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[0][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)
- `maxD` is the maximum value between the initial `maxD` and the initial `distance`

After executing the code:
- The value of `distance` is updated to \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)

The values of `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `w`, `points`, `minD`, and `maxD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, `minD` is 10000000, `maxD` is the maximum value between the initial `maxD` and the initial `distance`, `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)**
