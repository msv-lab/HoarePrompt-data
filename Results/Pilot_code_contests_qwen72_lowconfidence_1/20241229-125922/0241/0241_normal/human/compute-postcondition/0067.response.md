The code snippet `px = p2[0] - p1[0]` updates the value of `px` by recalculating it as the difference between the x-coordinates of `p2` and `p1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[2]`
- `p2` is `points[3]`
- `px` is `points[3][0] - points[2][0]`
- `py` is `points[3][1] - points[2][1]`
- `u` is the value of `u` after being checked
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`
- `dx` is `x1 - x`
- `dy` is `y1 - y`
- `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\)

After executing the code snippet:
- `px` is now `p2[0] - p1[0]`, which is the same as `points[3][0] - points[2][0]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[2]`
- `p2` is `points[3]`
- `px` is `p2[0] - p1[0]`
- `py` is `points[3][1] - points[2][1]`
- `u` is the value of `u` after being checked
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`
- `dx` is `x1 - x`
- `dy` is `y1 - y`
- `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)\)
