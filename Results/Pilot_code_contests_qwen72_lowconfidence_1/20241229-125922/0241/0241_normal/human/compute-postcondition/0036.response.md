The code snippet updates the value of `x1` using the formula `x1 = p1[0] + u * px`. To compute this, we need the values of `p1[0]`, `u`, and `px`.

- `p1[0]` is the x-coordinate of the first point in the list `points`.
- `u` is a value that has been adjusted to be within the range [0, 1].
- `px` is the difference in the x-coordinates between the second point and the first point in the list `points`.

Given these, the new value of `x1` is calculated as:

- `x1 = p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `p1` is `points[0]`, `p2` is `points[1]`, `px` is `points[1][0] - points[0][0]`, `py` is `points[1][1] - points[0][1]`, if `u` < 0, `u` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `u` > 1, `u` is set to 1, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[1][0] - points[0][0])`.**
