The code snippet updates the values of `p1` and `p2` by assigning them new values from the `points` list. Specifically, `p1` is set to `points[i]`, and `p2` is set to `points[(i + 1) % n]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples
- `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon
- `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon
- `p1` is `points[2]`
- `p2` is `points[3]`
- `px` is `points[3][0] - points[2][0]`
- `py` is `points[3][1] - points[2][1]`
- `u` is the value of `u` after being checked
- `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`
- `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`
- `dx` is `x1 - x`
- `dy` is `y1 - y`
- `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)

After executing the code:
- `p1` is now `points[2]`
- `p2` is now `points[(2 + 1) % n]`, which simplifies to `points[3 % n]`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `3 % n` will be 3, so `p2` is `points[3]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `r` is `stdin.readline`, `w` is `stdout.write`, `points` is a list of `n` tuples, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any vertex of the polygon, `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any edge of the polygon, `p1` is `points[2]`, `p2` is `points[3]`, `px` is `points[3][0] - points[2][0]`, `py` is `points[3][1] - points[2][1]`, `u` is the value of `u` after being checked, `x1` is `p1[0] + u * (points[3][0] - points[2][0])`, `y1` is `p1[1] + u * (points[3][1] - points[2][1])`, `dx` is `x1 - x`, `dy` is `y1 - y`, `distance` is \((dx * dx + dy * dy)**.
