The code snippet `minD = distance` updates the value of `minD` to the value of `distance`. The value of `distance` is calculated as \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `x` is the second integer from the input
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `r` is `stdin.readline`
- `w` is `stdout.write`
- `points` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon
- `minD` is now \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)
- `distance` is \(\left( \left| x - \text{points}[1][0] \right|^2 + \left| y - \text{points}[1][1] \right|^2 \right)^{1/2}\)
- `maxD` remains unchanged (initially set to 10000000)
