#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take as input the number of vertices of the polygon \( n \), and the coordinates of point \( P \) (x, y). Additionally, it should take \( n \) pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. All coordinates are integers and do not exceed 1,000,000 in absolute value. The point \( P \) lies strictly outside the polygon.

If `n` is greater than 0, `maxD` is the maximum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon, and `minD` is the minimum distance between the point \( P(x, y) \) and any segment of the polygon.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, consisting of the number of vertices of a polygon \( n \), the coordinates of a point \( P(x, y) \), and the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. It calculates the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. The function then computes the areas of the circles with radii equal to these minimum and maximum distances, respectively, and outputs the difference between these areas to standard output. The function does not return a boolean value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon; instead, it focuses on calculating and printing the area difference. If \( n \) is 0, the function assumes no vertices and sets the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, resulting in a negative area difference being printed.
