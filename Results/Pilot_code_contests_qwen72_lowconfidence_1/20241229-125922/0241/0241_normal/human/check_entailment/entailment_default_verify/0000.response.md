Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the program is correct, but the output hints reveal a critical flaw in the program's handling of edge cases, specifically when \( n = 0 \). According to the output hints, if \( n = 0 \), the program assumes no vertices and sets the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, resulting in a negative area difference being printed. This is incorrect because the problem description guarantees that the input will have at least one vertex (\( n \geq 3 \)), and the program should not produce a negative area difference under any valid input conditions. This indicates that the program has a logical error in how it initializes and handles the minimum and maximum distances, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
