You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path.

Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine.

Peter decided to tie his car to point P and now he is wondering what is the area of ​​the region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers — the number of vertices of the polygon n (<image>), and coordinates of point P.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers — coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three consecutive vertices lie on a common straight line.

All the numbers in the input are integers that do not exceed 1 000 000 in their absolute value.

Output

Print a single real value number — the area of the region that will be cleared. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program attempts to calculate the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to calculate the minimum and maximum distances to the edges of the polygon.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the projection of the point \( P \) onto the line segment defined by two consecutive vertices of the polygon. Specifically, the program uses the following formula to calculate the parameter \( u \):

```python
u = ((x - p1[0]) * px + (y - p1[1]) * py) / ((px * 1.0) ** 2 + (py * 1.0) ** 2)
```

This formula is correct for finding the projection of a point onto a line, but the program then clamps \( u \) to the range [0, 1] using the following lines:

```python
if u > 1:
    u = 1
if u < 0:
    u = 0
```

Clamping \( u \) to [0, 1] ensures that the projection point lies on the line segment, but it does not handle the case where the point \( P \) is outside the line segment. This can lead to incorrect distance calculations, especially when the point \( P \) is far from the line segment.

For example, consider a polygon with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((1, 1)\), and the point \( P \) at \((2, 0)\). The correct minimum distance from \( P \) to the polygon should be 1 (the distance to the closest vertex \((1, 0)\)). However, the program might incorrectly calculate the distance to the edge \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) as 2 because the projection of \( P \) onto the line segment is outside the segment, and the clamping logic sets \( u \) to 1, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and thus it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input from standard input, consisting of the number of vertices of a polygon \( n \), the coordinates of a point \( P(x, y) \), and the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. It calculates the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. The function then computes the areas of the circles with radii equal to these minimum and maximum distances, respectively, and outputs the difference between these areas to standard output. The function does not return a boolean value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon; instead, it focuses on calculating and printing the area difference. If \( n \) is 0, the function assumes no vertices and sets the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, resulting in a negative area difference being printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
