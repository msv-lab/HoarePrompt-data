You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path.

Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine.

Peter decided to tie his car to point P and now he is wondering what is the area of ​​the region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains three integers — the number of vertices of the polygon n (<image>), and coordinates of point P.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers — coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three consecutive vertices lie on a common straight line.

All the numbers in the input are integers that do not exceed 1 000 000 in their absolute value.

Output

Print a single real value number — the area of the region that will be cleared. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

def func_1():
    from sys import stdin, stdout
    from math import pi
    (r, w) = (stdin.readline, stdout.write)
    (n, x, y) = map(int, r().split())

        if distance > maxD:
            maxD = distance
        if distance < minD:
            minD = distance
    for i in xrange(n):
        (p1, p2) = (points[i], points[(i + 1) % n])
        px = p2[0] - p1[0]
        py = p2[1] - p1[1]
        u = ((x - p1[0]) * px + (y - p1[1]) * py) / ((px * 1.0) ** 2 + (py * 1.0) ** 2)
        if u > 1:
            u = 1
        if u < 0:
            u = 0
        x1 = p1[0] + u * px
        y1 = p1[1] + u * py
        dx = x1 - x
        dy = y1 - y
        distance = (dx * dx + dy * dy) ** 0.5
        if distance > maxD:
            maxD = distance
        if distance < minD:
            minD = distance
    minA = pi * minD ** 2
    maxA = pi * maxD ** 2
    w(str(maxA - minA))


```
Output hints: The function reads input from standard input, consisting of the number of vertices of a polygon \( n \), the coordinates of a point \( P(x, y) \), and the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon. It calculates the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. The function then computes the areas of the circles with radii equal to these minimum and maximum distances, respectively, and outputs the difference between these areas to standard output. The function does not return a boolean value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon; instead, it focuses on calculating and printing the area difference. If \( n \) is 0, the function assumes no vertices and sets the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, resulting in a negative area difference being printed.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
