Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle the case where the number of vertices \( n \) is 0. According to the problem description, \( n \) should be a positive integer, and the code assumes that \( n \) will always be greater than 0. However, if \( n \) were 0, the code would still execute, setting the minimum distance to 10,000,000 and the maximum distance to 0, which would result in a negative area difference being printed. This is incorrect behavior because the problem description specifies that \( n \) should be a positive integer, and the code should not produce a negative area difference in any valid case.

Additionally, the initial values for `minD` and `maxD` are set to 10,000,000 and 0, respectively. This can lead to incorrect results if the actual distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon are all greater than 10,000,000 or all less than 0, which is not possible but could still cause issues if the input is not carefully validated.

To fix this, the initial values for `minD` and `maxD` should be set to appropriate initial values that ensure they are updated correctly during the calculations. For example, `minD` should be initialized to a very large number (or `float('inf')`), and `maxD` should be initialized to a very small number (or `float('-inf')`). This ensures that the first distance calculated will always update these values correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    from sys import stdin, stdout
    from math import pi
    (r, w) = (stdin.readline, stdout.write)
    (n, x, y) = map(int, r().split())
    points = [list(map(int, r().split())) for i in range(n)]
    (maxD, minD) = (0, float('inf'))
    for i in range(n):
        distance = ((x - points[i][0]) ** 2 + (y - points[i][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
        if distance > maxD:
            maxD = distance
        if distance < minD:
            minD = distance
    for i in range(n):
        (p1, p2) = (points[i], points[(i + 1) % n])
        px = p2[0] - p1[0]
        py = p2[1] - p1[1]
        u = ((x - p1[0]) * px + (y - p1[1]) * py) / (px ** 2 + py ** 2)
        if u > 1:
            u = 1
        if u < 0:
            u = 0
        x1 = p1[0] + u * px
        y1 = p1[1] + u * py
        dx = x1 - x
        dy = y1 - y
        distance = (dx ** 2 + dy ** 2) ** 0.5
        if distance > maxD:
            maxD = distance
        if distance < minD:
            minD = distance
    minA = pi * minD ** 2
    maxA = pi * maxD ** 2
    w(str(maxA - minA))
```

This corrected version initializes `minD` to `float('inf')` and `maxD` to 0, ensuring that the distances are correctly updated and the area calculation is accurate for all valid inputs.
