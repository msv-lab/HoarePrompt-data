**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of the region that will be cleared by the snow blower, but it does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of Maximum and Minimum Distances**:
   - The program calculates the maximum and minimum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices of the polygon, which is correct.
   - However, it also calculates the distances from \( P \) to the closest points on the edges of the polygon, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The problem description only requires the maximum and minimum distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the polygon.

2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the area of the region cleared by the snow blower using the formula \( \pi \times (\text{maxD}^2 - \text{minD}^2) \), which is correct.
   - However, due to the incorrect calculation of `maxD` and `minD`, the final area may be incorrect.

3. **Unnecessary Calculations**:
   - The program includes a loop that calculates the distances from \( P \) to the closest points on the edges of the polygon. This is not required by the problem description and can lead to incorrect values for `maxD` and `minD`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the input as specified.
2. Calculate the distances from the point \( P \) to each vertex of the polygon.
3. Determine the maximum and minimum distances from \( P \) to the vertices.
4. Calculate the area of the region cleared by the snow blower using the formula \( \pi \times (\text{maxD}^2 - \text{minD}^2) \).
5. Output the result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from math import pi

def func_1():
    r, w = sys.stdin.readline, sys.stdout.write
    n, x, y = map(int, r().split())
    points = [tuple(map(int, r().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    maxD, minD = 0, float('inf')
    
    for px, py in points:
        distance = ((x - px) ** 2 + (y - py) ** 2) ** 0.5
        maxD = max(maxD, distance)
        minD = min(minD, distance)
    
    minA = pi * minD ** 2
    maxA = pi * maxD ** 2
    w(f"{maxA - minA}\n")

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not meet the problem description because it includes unnecessary calculations that can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program, as shown above, follows the problem description accurately and will produce the correct output for any valid input.
