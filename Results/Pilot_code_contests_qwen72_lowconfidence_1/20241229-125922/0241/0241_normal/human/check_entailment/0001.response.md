Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program attempts to calculate the minimum and maximum distances from the point \( P \) to the vertices and edges of the polygon. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to calculate the minimum and maximum distances to the edges of the polygon.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the projection of the point \( P \) onto the line segment defined by two consecutive vertices of the polygon. Specifically, the program uses the following formula to calculate the parameter \( u \):

```python
u = ((x - p1[0]) * px + (y - p1[1]) * py) / ((px * 1.0) ** 2 + (py * 1.0) ** 2)
```

This formula is correct for finding the projection of a point onto a line, but the program then clamps \( u \) to the range [0, 1] using the following lines:

```python
if u > 1:
    u = 1
if u < 0:
    u = 0
```

Clamping \( u \) to [0, 1] ensures that the projection point lies on the line segment, but it does not handle the case where the point \( P \) is outside the line segment. This can lead to incorrect distance calculations, especially when the point \( P \) is far from the line segment.

For example, consider a polygon with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((1, 1)\), and the point \( P \) at \((2, 0)\). The correct minimum distance from \( P \) to the polygon should be 1 (the distance to the closest vertex \((1, 0)\)). However, the program might incorrectly calculate the distance to the edge \((0, 0)\) to \((1, 0)\) as 2 because the projection of \( P \) onto the line segment is outside the segment, and the clamping logic sets \( u \) to 1, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and thus it is incorrect.
