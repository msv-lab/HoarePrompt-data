The input consists of an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) representing the number of vertices of the polygon, and the coordinates of point P (x_p, y_p) where -1,000,000 ≤ x_p, y_p ≤ 1,000,000. This is followed by n lines, each containing two integers (x_i, y_i) (-1,000,000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1,000,000) representing the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in either clockwise or counterclockwise order. No three consecutive vertices lie on a common straight line.
