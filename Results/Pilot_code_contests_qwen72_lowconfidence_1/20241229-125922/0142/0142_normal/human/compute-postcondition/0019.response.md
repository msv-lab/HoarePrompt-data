The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, and `n`) retain their values as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `d` is the next element in the list [2, 3, 5], `res` is the number of times the original `n` was divisible by the new `d` plus 2, `n` is now `n // d` and `n % d == 0`**
