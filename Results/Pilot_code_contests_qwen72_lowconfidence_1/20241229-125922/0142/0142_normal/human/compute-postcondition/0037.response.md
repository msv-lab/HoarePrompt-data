The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. This parameter `n` is derived from the product of two integers `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are within the range 1 to 10^9. The function processes `n` by dividing it by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder. It then returns two values: `n`, which is the result after all possible divisions, and `res`, which is the total count of divisions performed by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns `n`, the result of dividing the original `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res`, the total number of such divisions.**
