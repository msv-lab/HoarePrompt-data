The value of `n` is divided by `d`. Given that `n % d == 0`, this operation does not leave a remainder, and `n` is updated to `n // d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `d` is the next element in the list [2, 3, 5], `res` is the number of times the original `n` was divisible by the new `d` plus 1, `n` is now `n // d` and `n % d == 0`**
