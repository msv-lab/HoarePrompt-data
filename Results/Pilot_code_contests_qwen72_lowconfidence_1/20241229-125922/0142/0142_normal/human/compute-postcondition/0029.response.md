The value of `n` is divided by `d`. Given `d` is 3, the new value of `n` becomes `n / 3` (which is the same as the initial value of `n` because `n` was already defined as `n / 3`). Since `n` must be divisible by 3, the division does not change this condition. The state of `res` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`d` is 3, `n` is `n / 3` (or `n` remains divisible by 3), `res` is `res + 1`**
