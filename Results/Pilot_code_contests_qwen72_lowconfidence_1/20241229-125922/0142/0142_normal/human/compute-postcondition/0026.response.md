The value of `n` is divided by `d`. Since `d` is 3 and `n` must be divisible by 3, the division will result in an integer. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation, and `d` remains 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is 3, `n` is `n / 3`, `res` is unchanged, and `n` must be divisible by 3.
Output State: **`d` is 3, `n` is `n / 3`, `res` is unchanged, and `n` must be divisible by 3**
