The value of `n` is divided by `d`. Since `n` must be divisible by one of the values in `div` (e.g., 2, 3, 5), and `d` is one of these values, `n` will be updated to `n / d`. The values of `a`, `b`, `res`, and `div` remain unchanged.

Given that `n` was initially divisible by one of the values in `div`, the new value of `n` will be an integer. For example, if `n` was 6 and `d` is 2, then `n` becomes 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` = 0, `div` = [2, 3, 5], `n` is `n / d` (an integer)**.
