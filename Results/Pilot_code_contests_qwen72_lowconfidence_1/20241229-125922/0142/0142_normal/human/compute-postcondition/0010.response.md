The value of `n` is updated to `n / d`. Since `n` was already given as `n / d` (an integer) and `n` must be divisible by `d`, dividing `n` by `d` again results in an integer. The new value of `n` is `n // d`.

Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` = 2, `div` = [2, 3, 5], `n` is `n // d` (an integer), and `n` must be divisible by `d`**
