Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a single integer parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a tuple `(n, res)` where `n` is the original value of `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res` is the total number of such divisions. The function effectively reduces `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. If `n` is already a prime number or a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0. **

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will return `(1, 0)` since 1 has no factors of 2, 3, or 5.
- If `n` is a power of 2, 3, or 5, the function will reduce `n` to 1 and return the count of divisions.
- If `n` is a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0.
