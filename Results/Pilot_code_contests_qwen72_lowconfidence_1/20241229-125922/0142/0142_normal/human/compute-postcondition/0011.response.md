The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` was 2, so now `res` is 3. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `div`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` = 3, `div` = [2, 3, 5], `n` is `n // d` (an integer), and `n` must be divisible by `d`**
