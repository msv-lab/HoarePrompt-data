Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` is the total number of times the original `n` (which is the product of `a` and `b`) was divisible by any of the elements in `div` (2, 3, 5) without leaving a remainder, `n` is the original `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `div` = [2, 3, 5].**
