The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. This means that the previous value of `res` is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `d` is the next element in the list [2, 3, 5], `res` is the number of times the original `n` was divisible by the new `d` plus 3, `n` is now `n // d` and `n % d == 0`, `n` is now `n / d`**.
