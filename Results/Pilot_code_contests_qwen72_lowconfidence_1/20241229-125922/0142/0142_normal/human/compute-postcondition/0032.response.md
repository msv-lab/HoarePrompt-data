The value of `n` is divided by `d`. Since `d` is 3, `n` is divided by 3. Given that `n` must remain divisible by 3, after this division, `n` will still be an integer and divisible by 3. The value of `res` remains as `res + 2` as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`d` is 3, `n` is `n / 3` (and remains divisible by 3), `res` is `res + 2`**
