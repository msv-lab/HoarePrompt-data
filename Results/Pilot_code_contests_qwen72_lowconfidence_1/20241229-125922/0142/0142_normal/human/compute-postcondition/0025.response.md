To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the condition of the `while` loop, which is `n % d == 0`. This means that `n` must be divisible by `d` for the loop to execute.

Given the state right before the while loop:
- If `d` was 2, then `d` is now 3.
- If `d` was 3, then `d` is now 5.
- If `d` was 5, the loop will not execute again.
- `res` and `n` will be updated based on the new value of `d`.

We need to ensure that `n % d == 0` holds true for the current value of `d` (which is 3, 5, or the next value in the sequence).

### Analysis:
1. **If `d` was 2 and is now 3:**
   - The loop will execute if `n % 3 == 0`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be divisible by 3 for the loop to execute.

2. **If `d` was 3 and is now 5:**
   - The loop will execute if `n % 5 == 0`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be divisible by 5 for the loop to execute.

3. **If `d` was 5, the loop will not execute again:**
   - This is a terminal condition, and no further adjustments are needed.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `n` is divisible by the current value of `d`.

State: **`d` is 3, `n` must be divisible by 3, `res` and `n` will be updated based on the new value of `d`**
