The code snippet `n /= d` updates the value of `n` to `n / d`. Given the initial conditions, `n` must be divisible by `d`, so the result of `n / d` will be an integer.

- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `res` remains 1.
- `div` remains `[2, 3, 5]`.
- `n` is updated to `n / d`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` = 1, `div` = [2, 3, 5], `n` is `n / d` (an integer), and `n` must be divisible by `d`**.
