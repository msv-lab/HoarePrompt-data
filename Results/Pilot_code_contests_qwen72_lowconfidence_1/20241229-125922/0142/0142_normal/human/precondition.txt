The function `ope` seems to be incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should accept two parameters representing the weights of the two pieces of cheese, a and b. The correct function definition should be: `def ope(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109.
