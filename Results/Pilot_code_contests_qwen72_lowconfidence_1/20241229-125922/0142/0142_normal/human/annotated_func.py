    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` is the total number of times the original `n` (which is the product of `a` and `b`) was divisible by any of the elements in `div` (2, 3, 5) without leaving a remainder, `n` is the original `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `div` = [2, 3, 5].
    return n, res
    #The program returns `n`, which is the original product of `a` and `b` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res`, which is the total number of times the original `n` was divisible by any of the elements in `div` (2, 3, 5) without leaving a remainder.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single integer parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a tuple `(n, res)` where `n` is the original value of `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res` is the total number of such divisions. The function effectively reduces `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. If `n` is already a prime number or a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0.
