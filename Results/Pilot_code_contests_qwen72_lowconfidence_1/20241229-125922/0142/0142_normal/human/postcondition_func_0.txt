The function `func_1` accepts a single integer parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a tuple `(n, res)` where `n` is the original value of `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res` is the total number of such divisions. The function effectively reduces `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. If `n` is already a prime number or a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0.
