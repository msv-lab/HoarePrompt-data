Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the problem to finding the minimum number of operations to make the reduced values of `a` and `b` equal using the specified operations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the number of operations needed to reduce each value by dividing by 2, 3, or 5 until no further division is possible. If the reduced values of `a` and `b` are not equal, the program correctly returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the pieces equal. If they are equal, it sums the operations needed and returns the total, which matches the problem's requirements. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
