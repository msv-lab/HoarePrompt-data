Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program is intended to solve the problem described, but it has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in all cases. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `gcd` Function:**
   - The program uses `from fractions import gcd` to import the `gcd` function. However, in Python 3, the `gcd` function is available in the `math` module, not the `fractions` module. The correct import statement should be:
     ```python
     from math import gcd
     ```
   - This is a minor issue, but it would cause a runtime error if the program is run in Python 3.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Input:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is a Python 2 function. In Python 3, the correct function is `input()`.
   - This is another minor issue, but it would cause a runtime error in Python 3.

3. **Logical Error in the Algorithm:**
   - The main logical error lies in the way the program attempts to reduce the pieces of cheese to their smallest common form using the `func_1` function.
   - The program divides `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and then tries to reduce them further by dividing by 2, 3, and 5 until they are no longer divisible by these numbers.
   - However, this approach does not correctly handle the scenario where the pieces of cheese cannot be made equal by the allowed operations (dividing by 2, 3, or 5).

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the input `14 8`:
- The GCD of 14 and 8 is 2.
- After dividing by the GCD, `a` becomes 7 and `b` becomes 4.
- The `func_1` function will try to reduce 7 and 4 by dividing by 2, 3, or 5, but neither 7 nor 4 can be reduced further by these operations.
- The program will then check if `a` equals `b` and find that they do not, so it will print `-1`.

However, the correct output for `14 8` should be `-1` because it is impossible to make the pieces equal using the allowed operations. The program does produce the correct output in this case, but it does so for the wrong reason.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Divide both `a` and `b` by their GCD.
2. Then, repeatedly divide each of the resulting values by 2, 3, or 5 as long as they are divisible by these numbers.
3. If at any point the two values become equal, count the number of operations.
4. If the two values never become equal, return `-1`.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:

The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly handle the reduction of the pieces of cheese and does not always produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
