Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, ensuring they are within the range \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module. This step is crucial because it reduces the problem to finding the minimum number of operations to make the reduced values of `a` and `b` equal.

3. **Reduction by GCD**: By dividing both `a` and `b` by their GCD, the program ensures that the problem is simplified to finding the minimum number of operations to make the reduced values equal.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `res` to 0 and sets `div` to `[2, 3, 5]`.
   - **Reduction Loop**: For each divisor in `div`, the function repeatedly divides `n` by the divisor and increments `res` until `n` is no longer divisible by the divisor. This effectively removes all factors of 2, 3, and 5 from `n` and counts the number of such divisions.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple `(n, res)`, where `n` is the reduced value of the original `n` and `res` is the total number of operations performed.

5. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After reducing both `a` and `b` using `func_1`, the program checks if the reduced values of `a` and `b` are equal.
   - If they are equal, the program prints the sum of the operations (`x + y`).
   - If they are not equal, the program prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make the pieces equal.

6. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the program follows the intended logic.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly described as reducing `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5 and counting the number of such operations.

Given the above analysis and the annotations, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
