You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight a and b grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: "Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal" "Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?", the curious bears asked. "It's easy", said the fox. "If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal". 

The little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). 

Output

If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.

Program:
```
from fractions import gcd

(a, b) = (int(s) for s in raw_input().split())
g = gcd(a, b)
a /= g
b /= g
(a, x) = func_1(a)
(b, y) = func_1(b)
if a != b:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x + y)

def func_1(n):
    res = 0
    div = [2, 3, 5]
    for d in div:
        while n % d == 0:
            n /= d
            res += 1
    return (n, res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values are large (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently due to the use of the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module, which is deprecated in Python 3. Additionally, the `raw_input()` function is used, which is specific to Python 2 and will cause an error in Python 3. This means the program will fail to run correctly in a modern Python environment.

To further elaborate on the issues:
1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead of `raw_input()`.
2. **Use of `gcd` from `fractions` module**: In Python 3, `gcd` is available in the `math` module.

Here is a corrected version of the program for Python 3:

```python
from math import gcd

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
g = gcd(a, b)
a //= g
b //= g
(a, x) = func_1(a)
(b, y) = func_1(b)
if a != b:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x + y)

def func_1(n):
    res = 0
    div = [2, 3, 5]
    for d in div:
        while n % d == 0:
            n //= d
            res += 1
    return (n, res)
```

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from fractions import gcd

(a, b) = (int(s) for s in raw_input().split())
g = gcd(a, b)
a /= g
b /= g
(a, x) = func_1(a)
(b, y) = func_1(b)
if a != b:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x + y)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    res = 0
    div = [2, 3, 5]
    for d in div:
        while n % d == 0:
            n /= d
            res += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9, `res` is the total number of times the original `n` (which is the product of `a` and `b`) was divisible by any of the elements in `div` (2, 3, 5) without leaving a remainder, `n` is the original `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `div` = [2, 3, 5].
    return n, res
    #The program returns `n`, which is the original product of `a` and `b` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res`, which is the total number of times the original `n` was divisible by any of the elements in `div` (2, 3, 5) without leaving a remainder.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single integer parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a tuple `(n, res)` where `n` is the original value of `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res` is the total number of such divisions. The function effectively reduces `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. If `n` is already a prime number or a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
