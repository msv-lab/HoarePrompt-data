You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight a and b grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: "Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal" "Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?", the curious bears asked. "It's easy", said the fox. "If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal". 

The little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109). 

Output

If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.

Program:

from fractions import gcd

(a, b) = (int(s) for s in raw_input().split())
g = gcd(a, b)
a /= g
b /= g
(a, x) = func_1(a)
(b, y) = func_1(b)
if a != b:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x + y)

def func_1(n):
    res = 0
    div = [2, 3, 5]
    for d in div:
        while n % d == 0:
            n /= d
            res += 1
    return (n, res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the problem to finding the minimum number of operations to make the reduced values of `a` and `b` equal using the specified operations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the number of operations needed to reduce each value by dividing by 2, 3, or 5 until no further division is possible. If the reduced values of `a` and `b` are not equal, the program correctly returns `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the pieces equal. If they are equal, it sums the operations needed and returns the total, which matches the problem's requirements. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single integer parameter `n`, which is the product of two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns a tuple `(n, res)` where `n` is the original value of `n` divided by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible without leaving a remainder, and `res` is the total number of such divisions. The function effectively reduces `n` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. If `n` is already a prime number or a product of primes other than 2, 3, and 5, the function will return `n` unchanged and `res` will be 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
