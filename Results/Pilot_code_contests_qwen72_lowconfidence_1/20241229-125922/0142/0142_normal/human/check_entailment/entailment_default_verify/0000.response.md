Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints. The program correctly handles the following aspects:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the problem to finding the minimum number of operations to make the reduced values of `a` and `b` equal. This is a crucial step because it simplifies the problem by focusing on the core issue of making the pieces equal.

2. **Reduction Function (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` effectively reduces the values of `a` and `b` by removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, and counts how many times these factors were removed. This is done by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2, 3, and 5 as long as `n` is divisible by these numbers. The function returns the reduced value of `n` and the count of operations.

3. **Comparison and Output**: After reducing both `a` and `b`, the program checks if the reduced values are equal. If they are, it prints the sum of the operations needed to reduce them. If they are not equal, it prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to make the pieces equal.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` works as intended, reducing `n` by removing factors of 2, 3, and 5 and counting the operations. This aligns with the problem's requirements and the program's logic.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness. Hence, the final assessment remains **True**.
