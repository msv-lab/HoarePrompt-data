Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description in every potential case:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail in environments running Python 3.

2. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The program uses `from fractions import gcd`, which is deprecated in Python 3. The correct import statement for Python 3 is `from math import gcd`.

3. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to reduce the number by dividing it by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible. However, the main logic assumes that after reducing both `a` and `b` using `func_1`, if the resulting values are equal, then the original pieces can be made equal. This assumption is not always correct. For example, consider the input `(12, 18)`:
   - `12` can be reduced to `3` (12 / 2 / 2 / 3).
   - `18` can be reduced to `3` (18 / 2 / 3 / 3).
   - Both reduce to `3`, but the original pieces cannot be made equal using the allowed operations (dividing by 2, 3, or 5).

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the input is `(1, 2)`, the program will incorrectly return `-1` because it does not consider that the pieces are already equal (since both are 1 after reducing).

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
