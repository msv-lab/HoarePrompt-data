Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This is a significant issue because the problem description does not specify which version of Python should be used, but modern Python development typically uses Python 3.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The program uses `from fractions import gcd` to import the GCD function. However, in Python 3, the GCD function is available in the `math` module. The correct import statement for Python 3 would be `from math import gcd`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, consider the input `(1, 2)`. According to the problem description, the output should be `-1` because it is impossible to make the pieces equal. However, the program will incorrectly return `1` because it divides both `1` and `2` by their GCD (which is `1`), and then tries to reduce them using the `func_1` function, which will not change the values.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to reduce a number by dividing it by 2, 3, and 5 as many times as possible. However, the problem description requires that the pieces be made equal by performing the operations described (halving, taking two-thirds, or taking four-fifths). The function does not directly implement these operations, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
