Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input values are large (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently due to the use of the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module, which is deprecated in Python 3. Additionally, the `raw_input()` function is used, which is specific to Python 2 and will cause an error in Python 3. This means the program will fail to run correctly in a modern Python environment.

To further elaborate on the issues:
1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead of `raw_input()`.
2. **Use of `gcd` from `fractions` module**: In Python 3, `gcd` is available in the `math` module.

Here is a corrected version of the program for Python 3:

```python
from math import gcd

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
g = gcd(a, b)
a //= g
b //= g
(a, x) = func_1(a)
(b, y) = func_1(b)
if a != b:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(x + y)

def func_1(n):
    res = 0
    div = [2, 3, 5]
    for d in div:
        while n % d == 0:
            n //= d
            res += 1
    return (n, res)
```

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.
