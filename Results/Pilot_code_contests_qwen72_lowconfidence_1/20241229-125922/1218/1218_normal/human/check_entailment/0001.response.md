Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle large values of `k` correctly due to an incorrect assumption about the periodicity of the game outcomes. Specifically, the program uses a fixed period `p = 2520` to calculate the scores, which may not be the actual period of the game. The game's outcome sequence could have a different period, especially for certain configurations of `A` and `B`. As a result, the scores calculated for large `k` might be incorrect.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
1000000000000000000 1 1
2 2 1
3 3 1
3 1 3
1 1 1
2 1 1
1 2 3
```

The program might incorrectly assume that the game outcomes repeat every 2520 games, but the actual period could be different, leading to incorrect scores. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this input.
