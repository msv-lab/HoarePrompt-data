You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is working for the company that constructs robots. Ilya writes programs for entertainment robots, and his current project is "Bob", a new-generation game robot. Ilya's boss wants to know his progress so far. Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, "Alice". 

So now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called "1-2-3". This game is similar to the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. 

Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (i + 1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in i-th game. 

Ilya knows that the robots will play k games, Alice will choose number a in the first game, and Bob will choose b in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all k games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game. 

Input

The first line contains three numbers k, a, b (1 ≤ k ≤ 1018, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Ai, 1, Ai, 2, Ai, 3, where Ai, j represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Bi, 1, Bi, 2, Bi, 3, where Bi, j represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Bi, j ≤ 3). 

Output

Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after k games.

Note

In the second example game goes like this:

The fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.
Program:
```
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    g = lambda : [[0] * 4] + [[0] + f() for i in range(3)]
    h = lambda x, y: x - 1 == y % 3
    t = lambda a, b, u, v: (A[a][b], B[a][b], u + h(a, b), v + h(b, a))
    (k, a, b) = f()
    p = 2520
    (s, d) = divmod(k, p)
    (A, B) = (g(), g())
    u = v = x = y = 0
    for j in range(d):
        (a, b, u, v) = t(a, b, u, v)
    for i in range(p):
        (a, b, x, y) = t(a, b, x, y)
    print(u + x * s, v + y * s)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads input values for `k`, `a`, and `b`, and two 3x3 matrices `A` and `B`. It then simulates a game where Alice and Bob make choices based on their previous choices and the matrices `A` and `B`. The function calculates the number of times Alice and Bob choose options that satisfy a specific condition over `k` rounds. Specifically, it computes the total number of times Alice and Bob choose options such that `a - 1 == b % 3` and `b - 1 == a % 3`, respectively. The function prints the final counts of these occurrences. The function handles large values of `k` by breaking the simulation into segments of 2520 rounds, optimizing the computation. Edge cases include handling the initial values of `a` and `b` and ensuring the matrices `A` and `B` are correctly read and used in the calculations.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
