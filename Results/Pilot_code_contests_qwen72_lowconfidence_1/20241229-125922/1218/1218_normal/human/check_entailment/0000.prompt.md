You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is working for the company that constructs robots. Ilya writes programs for entertainment robots, and his current project is "Bob", a new-generation game robot. Ilya's boss wants to know his progress so far. Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, "Alice". 

So now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called "1-2-3". This game is similar to the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. 

Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (i + 1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in i-th game. 

Ilya knows that the robots will play k games, Alice will choose number a in the first game, and Bob will choose b in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all k games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game. 

Input

The first line contains three numbers k, a, b (1 ≤ k ≤ 1018, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Ai, 1, Ai, 2, Ai, 3, where Ai, j represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Bi, 1, Bi, 2, Bi, 3, where Bi, j represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Bi, j ≤ 3). 

Output

Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after k games.

Examples

Input

10 2 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
2 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 2


Output

1 9


Input

8 1 1
2 2 1
3 3 1
3 1 3
1 1 1
2 1 1
1 2 3


Output

5 2


Input

5 1 1
1 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 2
1 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 2


Output

0 0

Note

In the second example game goes like this:

<image>

The fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.
Program:
```
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    g = lambda : [[0] * 4] + [[0] + f() for i in range(3)]
    h = lambda x, y: x - 1 == y % 3
    t = lambda a, b, u, v: (A[a][b], B[a][b], u + h(a, b), v + h(b, a))
    (k, a, b) = f()
    p = 2520
    (s, d) = divmod(k, p)
    (A, B) = (g(), g())
    u = v = x = y = 0
    for j in range(d):
        (a, b, u, v) = t(a, b, u, v)
    for i in range(p):
        (a, b, x, y) = t(a, b, x, y)
    print(u + x * s, v + y * s)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
