Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input as specified, processes the game outcomes using the rules provided, and correctly calculates the scores for Alice and Bob over a large number of games (up to \(10^{18}\)). The program uses a cycle detection technique to handle the potentially large number of games efficiently, which is a valid approach given the constraints. The logic for determining the winner of each game and updating the scores is consistent with the game rules. No edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any valid input have been identified. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
