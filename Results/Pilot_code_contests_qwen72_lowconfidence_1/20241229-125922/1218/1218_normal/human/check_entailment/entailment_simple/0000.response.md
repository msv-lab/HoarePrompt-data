Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input values for `k`, `a`, and `b` using the `f` function.
   - It also reads the matrices `A` and `B` which represent the choices of Alice and Bob based on their previous choices.

2. **Helper Functions:**
   - `h(x, y)`: This function returns `True` if `x - 1` equals `y % 3`, which is used to determine if one number beats another in the game.
   - `t(a, b, u, v)`: This function updates the choices of Alice and Bob (`a` and `b`) and their scores (`u` and `v`) based on the current choices and the rules of the game.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program divides `k` into `s` full cycles of 2520 games and a remainder `d` of games.
   - It first simulates the first `d` games to account for the remainder.
   - Then, it simulates 2520 games to determine the periodic behavior of the scores.
   - Finally, it calculates the total scores by adding the scores from the remainder games and the scores from the full cycles multiplied by the number of full cycles.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total scores of Alice and Bob after `k` games.

### Why It Is Correct:
- **Simulation of Games:**
  - The program correctly simulates the game for the first `d` games and then for 2520 games to capture the periodic behavior.
  - The function `t` correctly updates the choices and scores based on the rules of the game.
- **Periodic Behavior:**
  - By simulating 2520 games, the program captures the periodic nature of the choices and scores, which is a key part of solving the problem efficiently.
- **Scoring:**
  - The scoring logic is implemented correctly using the `h` function to determine the winner of each game.
- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the total scores of Alice and Bob after `k` games.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles the input and output as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
