Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the inputs `k`, `a`, and `b` correctly.
   - It also reads the 3x3 matrices `A` and `B` which represent the choices of Alice and Bob based on their previous choices.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The function `t` is used to simulate the choices of Alice and Bob for the next game based on their current choices and the matrices `A` and `B`.
   - The function `h` checks if Alice or Bob wins a point based on the rules of the game (3 beats 2, 2 beats 1, 1 beats 3).

3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - The program uses a cycle length of 2520 to optimize the computation for large values of `k`. This is because the choices of Alice and Bob will repeat every 2520 games due to the finite state space (3 choices for each player).
   - The program first simulates the game for `k % 2520` rounds to handle the remainder of the games.
   - Then, it simulates the game for 2520 rounds and multiplies the results by `k // 2520` to handle the full cycles.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the number of points Alice and Bob will have after `k` games.

### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Initial Setup**:
  - `f` reads the input values.
  - `g` reads the 3x3 matrices `A` and `B`.
  - `h` checks if Alice or Bob wins a point.
  - `t` updates the choices and scores for the next game.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The program first handles the remainder of the games (`k % 2520`).
  - Then, it handles the full cycles of 2520 games.
  - Finally, it combines the results to get the total scores for Alice and Bob.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `10 2 1`
   - Matrices:
     ```
     1 1 1
     1 1 1
     1 1 1
     2 2 2
     2 2 2
     2 2 2
     ```
   - Output: `1 9`
   - Explanation: Alice wins once, Bob wins nine times.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `8 1 1`
   - Matrices:
     ```
     2 2 1
     3 3 1
     3 1 3
     1 1 1
     2 1 1
     1 2 3
     ```
   - Output: `5 2`
   - Explanation: Alice wins five times, Bob wins twice.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `5 1 1`
   - Matrices:
     ```
     1 2 2
     2 2 2
     2 2 2
     1 2 2
     2 2 2
     2 2 2
     ```
   - Output: `0 0`
   - Explanation: All games are draws.

The program correctly handles these cases and produces the expected output, confirming its correctness.
