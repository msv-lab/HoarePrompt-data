You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ilya is working for the company that constructs robots. Ilya writes programs for entertainment robots, and his current project is "Bob", a new-generation game robot. Ilya's boss wants to know his progress so far. Especially he is interested if Bob is better at playing different games than the previous model, "Alice". 

So now Ilya wants to compare his robots' performance in a simple game called "1-2-3". This game is similar to the "Rock-Paper-Scissors" game: both robots secretly choose a number from the set {1, 2, 3} and say it at the same moment. If both robots choose the same number, then it's a draw and noone gets any points. But if chosen numbers are different, then one of the robots gets a point: 3 beats 2, 2 beats 1 and 1 beats 3. 

Both robots' programs make them choose their numbers in such a way that their choice in (i + 1)-th game depends only on the numbers chosen by them in i-th game. 

Ilya knows that the robots will play k games, Alice will choose number a in the first game, and Bob will choose b in the first game. He also knows both robots' programs and can tell what each robot will choose depending on their choices in previous game. Ilya doesn't want to wait until robots play all k games, so he asks you to predict the number of points they will have after the final game. 

Input

The first line contains three numbers k, a, b (1 ≤ k ≤ 1018, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Ai, 1, Ai, 2, Ai, 3, where Ai, j represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 3). 

Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers Bi, 1, Bi, 2, Bi, 3, where Bi, j represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ Bi, j ≤ 3). 

Output

Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after k games.

The fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.
Program:
```
def func():
    f = lambda : list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    g = lambda : [[0] * 4] + [[0] + f() for i in range(3)]
    h = lambda x, y: x - 1 == y % 3
    t = lambda a, b, u, v: (A[a][b], B[a][b], u + h(a, b), v + h(b, a))
    (k, a, b) = f()
    p = 2520
    (s, d) = divmod(k, p)
    (A, B) = (g(), g())
    u = v = x = y = 0
    for j in range(d):
        (a, b, u, v) = t(a, b, u, v)
    for i in range(p):
        (a, b, x, y) = t(a, b, x, y)
    print(u + x * s, v + y * s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input as specified, processes the game outcomes using the rules provided, and correctly calculates the scores for Alice and Bob over a large number of games (up to \(10^{18}\)). The program uses a cycle detection technique to handle the potentially large number of games efficiently, which is a valid approach given the constraints. The logic for determining the winner of each game and updating the scores is consistent with the game rules. No edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any valid input have been identified. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
