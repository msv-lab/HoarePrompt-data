The variables `u`, `v`, `x`, and `y` are initialized to 0. The other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`, `p`, `s`, `d`, `A`, `B`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `p` is 2520, `s` is `k // 2520`, `d` is `k % 2520`, `A` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `B` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
