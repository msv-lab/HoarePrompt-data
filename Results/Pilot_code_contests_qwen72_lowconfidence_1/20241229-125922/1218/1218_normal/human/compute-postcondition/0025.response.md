Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `k`, `a`, and `b`, and two 3x3 matrices `A` and `B`. It then simulates a game where Alice and Bob make choices based on their previous choices and the matrices `A` and `B`. The function calculates the number of times Alice and Bob choose options that satisfy a specific condition over `k` rounds. Specifically, it computes the total number of times Alice and Bob choose options such that `a - 1 == b % 3` and `b - 1 == a % 3`, respectively. The function prints the final counts of these occurrences. The function handles large values of `k` by breaking the simulation into segments of 2520 rounds, optimizing the computation. Edge cases include handling the initial values of `a` and `b` and ensuring the matrices `A` and `B` are correctly read and used in the calculations. **
