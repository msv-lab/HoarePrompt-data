Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `a` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` for `p` times, `b` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` for `p` times, `x` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` for `p` times, `y` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` for `p` times, `u` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `u`, and `v` for `k % 2520` times (or remains the initial value if `k % 2520` is 0), `v` is the result of applying the function `t` to the initial values of `a`, `b`, `u`, and `v` for `k % 2520` times (or remains the initial value if `k % 2520` is 0), `p` is 2520, `s` is `k // 2520`, `d` is `k % 2520`, `A` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `B` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `j` is `k % 2520 - 1`, `i` is 2520.**
