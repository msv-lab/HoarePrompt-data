To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `p` is 2520
- `s` is `k // 2520`
- `d` is `k % 2520`
- `A` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input
- `B` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input
- `u` is 0
- `v` is 0
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(d):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `d` is greater than 0.
2. **Value of `d`**: `d` is calculated as `k % 2520`. For the loop to execute, `d` must be greater than 0, which means `k % 2520 > 0`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `d` is greater than 0, which means `k % 2520 > 0`.
- The variable `j` will start from 0 and iterate up to `d - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`k` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `p` is 2520, `s` is `k // 2520`, `d` is `k % 2520` and must be greater than 0, `A` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `B` is a 3x3 matrix of integers where each row is prepended with `0` and contains integers read from input, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `j` is 0**
