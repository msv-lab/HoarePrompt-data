k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, a and b are integers representing the choices of Alice and Bob respectively in the first game, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3. The next 3 lines contain 3 integers each, representing Alice's strategy matrix A, where 1 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 3. The following 3 lines also contain 3 integers each, representing Bob's strategy matrix B, where 1 ≤ Bi, j ≤ 3.
