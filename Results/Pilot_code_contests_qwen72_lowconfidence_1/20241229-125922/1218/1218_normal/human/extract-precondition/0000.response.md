Precondition: **k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), a and b are integers representing the initial choices of Alice and Bob respectively (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3). The matrices A and B are 3x3 matrices of integers (1 ≤ Ai, j, Bi, j ≤ 3) representing the choices of Alice and Bob in the next game based on their previous choices.**
