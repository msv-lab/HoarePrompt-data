The code snippet reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from standard input using the functions `rint()` and `rints()`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element is between 1 and `n`, and `int(input())` is equal to `t`.

After executing the code:
- `n` is assigned the value read by `rint()`.
- `a` is assigned the list of integers read by `rints()`.

The remaining variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()`, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin, `rints` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `out` is an empty list, and `int(input())` is equal to `t`.**
