Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the last element which is `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element. If `mem[1]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `a[l] != i` and `a[r] != i` and `a[l] != a[r]`.***
