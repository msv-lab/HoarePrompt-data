Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 2. If `mem[a[i]]` is 2, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
