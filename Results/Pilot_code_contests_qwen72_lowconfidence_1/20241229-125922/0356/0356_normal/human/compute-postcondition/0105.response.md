Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`. The elements at indices `n-1` down to `n-i` (where `i` is the largest integer such that `mem[i] > 0` and `a[l] == i` or `a[r] == i` and `a[l] != a[r]`) are `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`. `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`. `t` remains the same. `l` is the smallest index in `a` such that `a[l]` is not equal to `i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`, and `r` is the largest index in `a` such that `a[r]` is not equal to `i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`. If `mem[i]` is 0 for all `i` in the range `[1, n)`, the loop does not execute, and `l` and `r` remain 0 and `n-1` respectively.**
