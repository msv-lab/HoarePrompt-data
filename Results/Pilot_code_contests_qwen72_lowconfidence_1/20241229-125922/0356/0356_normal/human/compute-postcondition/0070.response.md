The code `ans[0] = '0'` updates the first element of the list `ans` to `'0'`. Since the initial state already specifies that the first element of `ans` is `'0'`, this operation does not change the value of `ans[0]`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the confirmation that `ans[0]` is indeed `'0'`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 2.**
