Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n` if `mem[a[1]]` was initially 2. Otherwise, the first element of `ans` is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the value of `mem[a[1]]` before the increment, and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`. `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 2, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.***
