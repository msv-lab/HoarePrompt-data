The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement. However, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
