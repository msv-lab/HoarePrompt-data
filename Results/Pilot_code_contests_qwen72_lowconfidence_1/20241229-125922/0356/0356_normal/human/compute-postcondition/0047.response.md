The line `ans[n - i] = '1'` changes the value of the element in the list `ans` at the index `n - i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so the index being modified is `n - 3`.

- Before this operation, `ans[n - 1]` and `ans[n - 2]` are both '1'.
- The operation sets `ans[n - 3]` to '1'.

Therefore, after executing the code, the updated state of `ans` includes `ans[n - 1]` as '1', `ans[n - 2]` as '1', and now `ans[n - 3]` as '1'. All other elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1', `ans[n - 2]` which is '1', and `ans[n - 3]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3. If `mem[i]` is 0, a `break` statement has been encountered.**
