The code `ans[n - i] = '1'` updates the element at index `n - i` in the list `ans` to `'1'`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` must be greater than 3
- `i` is 3
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- If `mem[i]` is 0, indicating that the integer 3 does not appear in `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. `n - i` evaluates to `n - 3` since `i` is 3.
2. The element at index `n - 3` in `ans` is set to `'1'`.

Therefore, the updated `ans` list will have the element at index `n - 3` set to `'1'`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 3` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
