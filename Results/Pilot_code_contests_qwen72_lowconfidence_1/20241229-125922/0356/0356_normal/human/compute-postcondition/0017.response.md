The value of `mem[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 2, `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mem[a[2]]` was 2, so now it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[2]]` is 3, `mem[a[i]]` is 2 for i ≠ 2, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `i` is 2.**
