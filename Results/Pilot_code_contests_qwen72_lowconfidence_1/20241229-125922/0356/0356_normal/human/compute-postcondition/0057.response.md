The code reassigns `ans` to a list of '0' with length `n` and `mem` to a list of 0 with length `n + 1`. The initial values of `ans` and `mem` are overwritten, while the other variables (`n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `l` and `r` are reset to their initial values, `t` remains the same.**
