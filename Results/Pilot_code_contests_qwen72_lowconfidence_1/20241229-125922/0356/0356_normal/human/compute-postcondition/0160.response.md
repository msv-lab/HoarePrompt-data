The given code snippet is:

```
print('\n'.join(out))
```

This line of code prints each element of the list `out`, separated by a newline character. The values of the variables `t`, `out`, `ans`, `mem`, `l`, `r`, and `i` are not directly modified by this line of code. However, the output of the program is generated, which consists of the strings in the list `out`, each printed on a new line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `out` is a list of strings, each string is the result of `''.join(ans)` for each test case, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` for each test case where `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', and for each `i` in the range [1, n-1], if `mem[i]` is non-zero and the conditions in the loop did not cause a break, `ans[n - i]` will be '1'. Otherwise, `ans[n - i]` will remain '0', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` for each test case and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is the last index where `a[l]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the start of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, `r` is the last index where `a[r]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the end of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, and `i` is the value of the iteration where the loop either completed or broke. The contents of `out` have been printed, each string on a new line.**
