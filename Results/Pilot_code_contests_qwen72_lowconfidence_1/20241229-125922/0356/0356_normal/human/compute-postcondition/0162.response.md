Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function generates a binary string of length `n` where the first character is '0' if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise it is '1'. For subsequent characters in the string, starting from the end, the function sets the character to '1' if the integer corresponding to its position from the end (1-indexed) appears exactly once in `a` and meets certain conditions involving the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) positions of the array `a`. The final result is a list of these binary strings, one for each test case, which is then printed to standard output, each on a new line. The function modifies no external state and does not return any value. Edge cases include when `a` contains duplicate values, when `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and when `a` has repeated values but still meets the conditions for setting '1' in the result string. **
