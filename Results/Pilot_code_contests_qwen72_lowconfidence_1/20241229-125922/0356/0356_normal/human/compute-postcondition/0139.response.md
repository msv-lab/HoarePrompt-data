To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the last element which is `'1'`.
- `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.
- If `a[l] != i` and `a[r] != i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a[l] != a[r]` and `a[r] != i`. If `a[l] == i`, then `l` is `1` and `r` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `a[l]` is 1. If `a[l] != i`, then `l` is `0` and `r` is `n - 2`. If `mem[1]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Other Conditions**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The conditions involving `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `mem[1]` must be checked, but they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the last element which is `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.**
