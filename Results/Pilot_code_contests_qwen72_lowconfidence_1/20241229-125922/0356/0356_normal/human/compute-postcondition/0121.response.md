The code `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i]` in the list `mem` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is determined by the value of `mem[a[1]]` before the increment (either `'0'` or `'1'`), and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`.
- `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` was incremented by 2, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `l` is `0`.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.

Given that `i` is 2, the code will increment the value at `mem[a[2]]` by 1. This means:

- If `a[2]` is an index within the bounds of `mem`, the value at `mem[a[2]]` will be incremented by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the value of `mem[a[1]]` before the increment, and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`, `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` was incremented by 2, and `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.**
