Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` where `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 0, and if `mem[a[i]]` is 2, `ans` is updated such that the first element is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
