The code initializes two new lists, `ans` and `mem`. `ans` is initialized as a list of strings '0' with a length of `n`, and `mem` is initialized as a list of integers 0 with a length of `n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()`, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin, `rints` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `out` is an empty list, `int(input())` is equal to `t`, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`.**
