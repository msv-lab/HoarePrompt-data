The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 3` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `l` is `l + 1`.**
