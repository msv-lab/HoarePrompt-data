The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we assume `r` has some initial value, and this value is decreased by 1.

The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects only the change in `r`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[2]` is 0 (indicating that the integer 2 does not appear in `a`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `r` is `r - 1`.**
