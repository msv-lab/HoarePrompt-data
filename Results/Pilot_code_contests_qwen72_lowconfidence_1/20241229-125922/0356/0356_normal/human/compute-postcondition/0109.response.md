The provided Python code initializes two lists: `ans` and `mem`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` is initialized to a list of `n` elements, all set to `'0'`. This overrides the previous definition of `ans` which was based on the conditions of the appearance of integers in `a`.
- `mem` is initialized to a list of `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This overrides the previous definition of `mem` which was a list of counts of each integer in `a`.

The variables `n`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `r`, and `out` are not directly affected by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged. However, since `ans` and `mem` are redefined, any logic that previously depended on their original values would no longer apply.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list of `'0'` of length `n`, `mem` is a list of `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is the smallest index in `a` such that `a[l]` is not equal to `i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`, `r` is the largest index in `a` such that `a[r]` is not equal to `i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.**
