To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop conditions step by step.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`.
- `mem[a[0]]` is 1, and `mem[a[i]]` is 2.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Other Variables:
- `t`, `n`, `a`, `out`, `ans`, `mem`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i` in the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, and `mem[a[i]]` is 2, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `i` is 2.**
