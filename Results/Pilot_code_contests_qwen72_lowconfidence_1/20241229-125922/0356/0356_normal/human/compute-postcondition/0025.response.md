The line of code `ans[n - i] = '1'` updates the element at index `n - i` in the list `ans` to the value `'1'`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`.
- `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- If `mem[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code `ans[n - i] = '1'`:

- The value of `ans[n - i]` (which is `ans[n - 1]` since `i` is 1) is updated to `'1'`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, if `mem[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
