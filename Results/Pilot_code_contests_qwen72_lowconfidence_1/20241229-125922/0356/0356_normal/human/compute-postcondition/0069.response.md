The code snippet `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i]` in the list `mem` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, this means `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. Since `mem[a[0]]` and `mem[a[1]]` are already set to 1, the new value of `mem[a[2]]` will be 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). However, without knowing the specific value of `a[2]`, we can only say that `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `mem[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 2.**
