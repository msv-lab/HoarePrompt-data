The `rints` function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, and converts each string to an integer, returning a list of these integers.

The initial state specifies that `rint` is a function that reads an integer from `stdin`. The new definition of `rints` does not alter this state but adds a new function `rints` to the environment.

Therefore, the Output State is: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin. `rints` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin.**
