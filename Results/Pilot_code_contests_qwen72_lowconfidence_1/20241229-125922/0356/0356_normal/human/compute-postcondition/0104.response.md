Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 3` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l] != i` and `a[r] != i` or `a[l] == a[r] == i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] == i`, then `l` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] != i`, then `r` is decremented by 1.***
