To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`.
- `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n-1`, and this sequence is non-empty only if `n > 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` will start at 1, not `n - 1` as stated in the initial state.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- Set `i` to 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
