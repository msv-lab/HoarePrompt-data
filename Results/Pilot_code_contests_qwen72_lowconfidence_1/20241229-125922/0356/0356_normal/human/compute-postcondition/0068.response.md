To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`.
- `mem[a[0]]` is 1.
- `mem[a[1]]` is 1.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is 1.
- If `mem[a[i]]` is 2, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The other variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `mem`, `l`, `r`, `t`) remain the same unless modified within the loop body (which is omitted).

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`.
- `mem[a[0]]` is 1.
- `mem[a[1]]` is 1.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 2.**
