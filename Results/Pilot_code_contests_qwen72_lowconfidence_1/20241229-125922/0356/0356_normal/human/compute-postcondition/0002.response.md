The code initializes an empty list `out`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `rint`, or `rints`. The only change is the creation of the new list `out`.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin. `rints` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin. `out` is an empty list.**
