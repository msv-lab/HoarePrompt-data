To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1'.
- `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- If `mem[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `a[l]` is not equal to `i` and `a[r]` is not equal to `i`, or both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, if `a[l] == i`, then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`.
- If `a[l]` is not equal to `i` and `a[r]` is not equal to `i`, then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**.
