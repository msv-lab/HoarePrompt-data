The function `func` appears to be missing its parameters in the provided signature. Based on the parameter constraints given, the function should accept parameters that reflect these constraints. Assuming the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (as indicated by `t`), each with a specific integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, the function's signature and functionality can be described as follows:

- The function `func` accepts three parameters:
  - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: An integer representing the size of the list, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.
    - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

- The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, since the exact output or the nature of the processing is not specified in the question, I'll describe the functionality based on the common pattern of returning results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a parameter `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.** 

If more specific details about the output are needed, they should be provided to refine this description.
