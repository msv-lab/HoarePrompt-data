The code snippet `ans[0] = '0'` changes the first element of the list `ans` from either `'1'` or `'0'` to `'0'`. The rest of the variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`, `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 2, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element**
