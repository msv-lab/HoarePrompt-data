The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is inside. In this context, it does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 3` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
