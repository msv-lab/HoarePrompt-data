The code snippet updates the first element of the list `ans` to `'1'`, sets `l` to `0`, and sets `r` to `n - 1`. Here's the updated state:

- `ans[0]` is now `'1'`.
- `l` is now `0`.
- `r` is now `n - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()`, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin, `rints` is a function that reads a list of integers from stdin, `out` is an empty list, `int(input())` is equal to `t`, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
