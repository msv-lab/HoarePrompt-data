The code `ans[n - i] = '1'` updates the element at the index `n - i` of the list `ans` to `'1'`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `t` remains the same

Since `i` is 1, `n - i` evaluates to `n - 1`. Therefore, the last element of `ans` (which is currently `'0'`) is updated to `'1'`.

The updated state is:

- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `t` remains the same

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same.**
