The given code snippet `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `mem[a[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `out` remains an empty list.
- `ans` remains unchanged except for the first element which is '1' if `mem[a[i]]` is not 2, otherwise '0'.
- `mem` is updated: `mem[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, and `mem[a[i]]` (where `i` is 1) is 1 if the condition was met in the initial state. After the code executes, `mem[a[i]]` will be 2.
- `l` remains 0.
- `r` remains `n - 1`.
- `i` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '0' because `mem[a[i]]` is now 2, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[i]]` is 2, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 1.**
