Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, and `mem[a[i]]` is 2***
