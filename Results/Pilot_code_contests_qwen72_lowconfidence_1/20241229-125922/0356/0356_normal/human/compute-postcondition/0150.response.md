Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the elements at index `n - 2` and the last element which are both `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element. If `mem[i]` is 0, the state remains as described above.***
