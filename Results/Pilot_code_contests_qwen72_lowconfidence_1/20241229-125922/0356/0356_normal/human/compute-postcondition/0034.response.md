Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, if `mem[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is not equal to `i` and `a[r]` is not equal to `i`, or both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `a[l] == i`, then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. If `a[l]` is not equal to `i` and `a[r]` is not equal to `i`, then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.***
