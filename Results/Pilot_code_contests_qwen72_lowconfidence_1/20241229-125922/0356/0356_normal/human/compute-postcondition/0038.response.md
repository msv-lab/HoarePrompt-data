The code `ans[n - i] = '1'` updates the element at the index `n - i` of the list `ans` to `'1'`. Given that `i` is 2, the index being updated is `n - 2`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `ans[n - 2]` is set to `'1'`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1' and `ans[n - 2]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `mem[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
