The code snippet `ans[n - i] = '1'` modifies the list `ans` by setting the element at index `n - i` to `'1'`. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- If `mem[2]` is 0 (indicating that the integer 2 does not appear in `a`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Let's calculate the impact of the code:

1. `n - i` evaluates to `n - 2` since `i` is 2.
2. The element at index `n - 2` in `ans` is set to `'1'`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- If `mem[2]` is 0 (indicating that the integer 2 does not appear in `a`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, if `mem[2]` is 0 (indicating that the integer 2 does not appear in `a`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
