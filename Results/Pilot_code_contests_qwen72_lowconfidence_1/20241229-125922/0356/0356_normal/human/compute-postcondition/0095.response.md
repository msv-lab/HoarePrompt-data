Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same. If `a[l] != i and a[r] != i or a[l] == a[r] == i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `mem[2]` is 0 (indicating that the integer 2 does not appear in `a`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is 2, `l` is 1. Otherwise, `r` is `r - 1`.***
