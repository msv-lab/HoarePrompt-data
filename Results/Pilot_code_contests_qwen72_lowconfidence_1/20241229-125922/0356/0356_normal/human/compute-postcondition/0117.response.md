The code snippet `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i]` in the list `mem` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`
- `ans` is a list where the first element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the value of `mem[a[1]]` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`
- `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element

Since `i` is 1, the code `mem[a[i]] += 1` will increment the value at the index `a[1]` in `mem` by 1. Initially, `mem[a[1]]` was already incremented by 1, so this will be incremented again by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`
- `ans` is a list where the first element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the value of `mem[a[1]]` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`
- `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 2, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `l` is `0`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the value of `mem[a[1]]` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`, `mem` is a list where `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 2, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element**
