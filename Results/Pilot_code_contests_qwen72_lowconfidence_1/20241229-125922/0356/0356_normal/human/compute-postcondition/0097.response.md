The `break` statement causes the program to exit from the most internal loop or if statement. Since the initial state specifies conditions under which the break might occur, these conditions are no longer relevant after the break. However, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the element at index `n - 2` is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
