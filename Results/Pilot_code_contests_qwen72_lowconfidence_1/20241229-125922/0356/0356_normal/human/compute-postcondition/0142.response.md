The code `ans[n - i] = '1'` updates the `ans` list at the index `n - i` to `'1'`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the last element which is `'1'`.

Given `i` is 2, the expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 2`. This means the element at the position `n - 2` in the `ans` list will be updated to `'1'`.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `n - 2` will be a valid index within the bounds of the `ans` list.

The other variables (`a`, `mem`, `t`, `out`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the elements at index `n - 2` and the last element which are both `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element. If `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
