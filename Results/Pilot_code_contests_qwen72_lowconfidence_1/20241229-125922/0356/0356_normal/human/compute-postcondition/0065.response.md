The code snippet `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i]` in the list `mem` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, and `mem[a[0]]` is 1.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is 1.
- If `mem[a[1]]` is 2, `ans` is updated such that the first element is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

Let's evaluate the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`.
2. `mem[a[1]]` is incremented by 1.
3. Since `mem[a[0]]` is 1 initially, and `a[1]` could be different from `a[0]`, `mem[a[1]]` was 0 before this operation, and now it is 1.
4. The condition `if mem[a[1]] is 2` is not met because `mem[a[1]]` is now 1, not 2. Therefore, `ans` is not updated.

The output state is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, and `mem[a[1]]` is 1.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 1.**
