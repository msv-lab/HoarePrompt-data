To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step, considering the initial state and the changes that occur during each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, and `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i < n` (exclusive). For each iteration:
1. If `mem[i]` is 0, the loop breaks.
2. Otherwise, `ans[n - i]` is set to '1'.
3. If `a[l] != i` and `a[r] != i` or both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are equal to `i`, the loop breaks.
4. If `a[l] == i`, `l` is incremented by 1.
5. If `a[r] == i`, `r` is decremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`** remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- **`n`** remains an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- **`a`** remains a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- **`out`** remains an empty list.
- **`ans`**:
  - `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1'.
  - For each `i` in the range [1, n-1], if `mem[i]` is non-zero and the conditions in the loop did not cause a break, `ans[n - i]` will be '1'. Otherwise, `ans[n - i]` will remain '0'.
- **`mem`** remains a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- **`l`**:
  - If the loop completes without breaking, `l` will be the number of elements from the start of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values.
  - If the loop breaks, `l` will be the last index where `a[l]` matched `i`.
- **`r`**:
  - If the loop completes without breaking, `r` will be the number of elements from the end of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values.
  - If the loop breaks, `r` will be the last index where `a[r]` matched `i`.
- **`i`** will be the value of the iteration where the loop either completed or broke.

### Summary:
The loop processes the list `a` to set specific indices in `ans` based on the counts in `mem` and the positions of elements in `a`. The loop may break early if certain conditions are met.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` where `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', and for each `i` in the range [1, n-1], if `mem[i]` is non-zero and the conditions in the loop did not cause a break, `ans[n - i]` will be '1'. Otherwise, `ans[n - i]` will remain '0', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is the last index where `a[l]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the start of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, `r` is the last index where `a[r]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the end of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, and `i` is the value of the iteration where the loop either completed or broke.**
