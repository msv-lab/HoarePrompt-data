The code `mem[a[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i]` in the list `mem` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, the value at the index `a[0]` in `mem` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'1'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, but now `mem[a[0]]` is 1
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'1'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` where `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 0**
