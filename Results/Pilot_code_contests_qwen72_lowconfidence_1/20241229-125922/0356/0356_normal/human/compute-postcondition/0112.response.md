The value of `mem[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0 initially, `mem[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'1'` and the rest are `'0'` of length `n`, `mem` is a list where the first element `mem[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `l` is `0`, `r` is `n - 1`, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.**
