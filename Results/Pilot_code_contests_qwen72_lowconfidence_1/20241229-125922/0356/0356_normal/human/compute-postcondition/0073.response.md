To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states based on the given conditions and the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n` must be greater than 1**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and runs until `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`i` should be 1**: This is the starting point of the loop as per the `range(1, n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same**.
