To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step:

```python
for i in range(n):
    mem[a[i]] += 1
    if mem[a[i]] == 2:
        ans[0] = '0'
```

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, `mem[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
- If `mem[a[i]]` becomes 2, `ans[0]` is set to '0'.

### Output State:
- After the loop finishes, `mem` will contain the count of each element in `a`.
- `ans[0]` will be '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once (i.e., `mem[a[i]]` becomes 2 for any `i`).
- `ans[0]` will remain '1' if all elements in `a` are unique.

### Final Output State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`.
- If any element in `a` appears more than once, `ans[0]` is '0'; otherwise, `ans[0]` is '1'.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, where `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1].
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n`, `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
