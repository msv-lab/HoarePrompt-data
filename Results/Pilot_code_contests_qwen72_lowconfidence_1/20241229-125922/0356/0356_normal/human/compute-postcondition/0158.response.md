The code snippet `out.append(''.join(ans))` appends the string representation of the list `ans` to the list `out`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except for the indices `n - i` for each `i` from 1 to the last successful iteration where `mem[i]` was non-zero, these indices are set to `'1'`.
- `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element.
- `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the last successful iteration where `a[l]` or `a[r]` matched the current `i`, with `l` being incremented for each match of `a[l]` and `r` being decremented for each match of `a[r]`. If no valid `i` is found (i.e., `mem[i]` is zero for all `i`), the loop does not execute, and `l` and `r` remain `0` and `n-1`, respectively.

The impact of the code:
- The string `''.join(ans)` is appended to the list `out`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except for the indices `n - i` for each `i` from 1 to the last successful iteration where `mem[i]` was non-zero, these indices are set to `'1'`.
- `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element, and the previous elements of `out` are unchanged.
- `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the last successful iteration where `a[l]` or `a[r]` matched the current `i`, with `l` being incremented for each match of `a[l]` and `r` being decremented for each match of `a[r]`. If no valid `i` is found (i.e., `mem[i]` is zero for all `i`), the loop does not execute, and `l` and `r` remain `0` and `n-1`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except for the indices `n - i` for each `i` from 1 to the last successful iteration where `mem[i]` was non-zero, these indices are set to `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element, and the previous elements of `out` are unchanged, `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the last successful iteration where `a[l]` or `a[r]` matched the current `i`, with `l` being incremented for each match of `a[l]` and `r` being decremented for each match of `a[r]`. If no valid `i` is found (i.e., `mem[i]` is zero for all `i`), the loop does not execute, and `l` and `r` remain `0` and `n-1`, respectively.**
