Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, and either `a[l]` is 1 and `a[r]` is not 1, or `a[l]` is not 1 and `a[r]` is 1, or both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are not 1. Additionally, `a[l]` is not equal to `i`.***
