The code snippet updates the first element of the `ans` list to `'1'`, sets `l` to `0`, and sets `r` to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'1'` and the rest are '0' with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same.**
