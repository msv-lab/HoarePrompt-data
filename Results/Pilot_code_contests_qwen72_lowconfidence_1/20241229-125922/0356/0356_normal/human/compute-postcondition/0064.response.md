To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of input integers.
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`.
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, where `mem[a[0]]` is 1.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.
- `t` remains the same.
- `i` is 0.
- If `mem[a[i]]` is 2, `ans` is updated such that the first element is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mem[a[0]]` is 1 (since `mem[a[0]]` was set to 1 initially).

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- **Check `mem[a[i]]`**: We need to check the value of `mem[a[1]]` to determine if `ans` needs to be updated.
- **Update `ans` if Necessary**: If `mem[a[1]]` is 2, the first element of `ans` will be updated to `'0'`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `mem[a[1]]` is checked. If `mem[a[1]]` is 2, `ans` is updated. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` where `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 1, and if `mem[a[1]]` is 2, `ans` is updated such that the first element is `'0'`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
