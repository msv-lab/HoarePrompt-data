The `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, and the count of the integer at index `i` in `mem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
