The `break` statement exits the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, `ans`, `mem`, and `t` remain unchanged. However, the control flow of the program is affected by the `break` statement, which means we exit the loop or if statement immediately.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise the first element is `'1'`, the last element is `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of counts of each integer in `a` with length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
