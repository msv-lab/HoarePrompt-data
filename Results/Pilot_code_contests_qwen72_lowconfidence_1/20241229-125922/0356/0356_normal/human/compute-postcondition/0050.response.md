The code snippet provided is:
```
r -= 1
```

This operation decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `r`, we only know that it is being decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` except `ans[n - 1]` which is '1', `ans[n - 2]` which is '1', and `ans[n - 3]` which is '1', `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is decremented by 1, if `mem[i]` is 0, a `break` statement has been encountered.**
