The provided code snippet is:

```python
r -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of `r` by 1. To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of this operation on the initial state.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the elements at index `n - 2` and the last element which are both `'1'`
- `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element
- If `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `r` is decremented by 1.
- No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`
- `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the elements at index `n - 2` and the last element which are both `'1'`
- `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`
- `t` remains the same
- `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element
- `r` is decremented by 1
- If `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of input integers of length `n`, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `'1'`, and the rest are `'0'` except the elements at index `n - 2` and the last element which are both `'1'`, `mem` is a list where each element `mem[x]` (for `x` in `a`) is incremented by the count of `x` in `a`, and the rest are `0` of length `n + 1`, `t` remains the same, `out` is a list that now contains the string `''.join(ans)` as its last element, `r` is decremented by 1, if `mem[i]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
