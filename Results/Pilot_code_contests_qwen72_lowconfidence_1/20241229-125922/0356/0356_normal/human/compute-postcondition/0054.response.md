The code snippet `out.append(''.join(ans))` appends a string, which is the concatenation of the elements in the list `ans`, to the list `out`. Here's the updated state:

- `out` now contains one additional element, which is a string formed by joining the elements of `ans` without any separators.
- The state of `ans` remains unchanged as a list of characters ('0' or '1') based on the conditions described in the initial state.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `mem`, `l`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is a list containing a single string `''.join(ans)`, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` where `ans[0]` is '0' if any element in `a` appears more than once, otherwise `ans[0]` is '1', and for each `i` in the range [1, n-1], if `mem[i]` is non-zero and the conditions in the loop did not cause a break, `ans[n - i]` will be '1'. Otherwise, `ans[n - i]` will remain '0', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1` and `mem[a[i]]` contains the count of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range [0, n-1], `l` is the last index where `a[l]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the start of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, `r` is the last index where `a[r]` matched `i` or the number of elements from the end of `a` that match the corresponding `i` values, and `i` is the value of the iteration where the loop either completed or broke.**
