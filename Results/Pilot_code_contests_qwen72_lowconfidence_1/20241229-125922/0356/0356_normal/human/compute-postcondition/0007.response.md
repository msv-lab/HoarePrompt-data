To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Let's break down the state and the loop condition:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer read by `rint()`
- `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5
- `out` is an empty list
- `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '1'
- `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n - 1`

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts and will increment by 1 with each iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer read by `rint()` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read by `rints()` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5, `out` is an empty list, `ans` is a list of '0' with length `n` and `ans[0]` is '1', `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0**
