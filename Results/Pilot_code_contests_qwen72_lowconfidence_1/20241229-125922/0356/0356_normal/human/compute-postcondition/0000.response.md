The `rint` function is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input (`stdin`) and converts it to an integer. This function does not alter any existing variables in the initial state, but it defines a new function `rint` that can be used to read integers from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. `rint` is a function that reads an integer from stdin.**
