The code `ans[0] = '0'` updates the first element of the `ans` list to `'0'`. However, this assignment does not change the value since the first element of `ans` was already `'0'` according to the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `'0'` and the rest are `'0'` with length `n`, `mem` is a list of 0 with length `n + 1`, `mem[a[0]]` is 1, `mem[a[1]]` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `t` remains the same, `i` is 1.**
