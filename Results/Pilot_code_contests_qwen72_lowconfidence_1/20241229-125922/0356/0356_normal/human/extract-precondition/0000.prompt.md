You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers a of length n. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.

The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter k, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length k in a.

More formally, for an array a of length n and an integer k, define the k-compression array of a as an array b of length n-k+1, such that $$$b_j =min_{j≤ i≤ j+k-1}a_i$$$

For example, the 3-compression array of [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] is [min\{1, 3, 4\}, min\{3, 4, 5\}, min\{4, 5, 2\}]=[1, 3, 2].

A permutation of length m is an array consisting of m distinct integers from 1 to m in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3 but there is 4 in the array).

A k-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array a, determine for all 1≤ k≤ n if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of this array or not.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 3⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ n) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 3⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a binary string of length n. 

The k-th character of the string should be 1 if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of the array a, and 0 otherwise. 

Example

Output

0001
00111
1111111111
000

Note

In the first test case, a=[1, 5, 3, 4, 2].

  * The 1-compression of a is [1, 5, 3, 4, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 2-compression of a is [1, 3, 3, 2] and it is not a permutation, since 3 appears twice. 
  * The 3-compression of a is [1, 3, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 4-compression of a is [1, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 5-compression of a is [1] and it is a permutation.
