You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers a of length n. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.

The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter k, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length k in a.

More formally, for an array a of length n and an integer k, define the k-compression array of a as an array b of length n-k+1, such that $$$b_j =min_{j≤ i≤ j+k-1}a_i$$$

For example, the 3-compression array of [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] is [min\{1, 3, 4\}, min\{3, 4, 5\}, min\{4, 5, 2\}]=[1, 3, 2].

A permutation of length m is an array consisting of m distinct integers from 1 to m in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3 but there is 4 in the array).

A k-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array a, determine for all 1≤ k≤ n if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of this array or not.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 3⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ n) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 3⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a binary string of length n. 

The k-th character of the string should be 1 if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of the array a, and 0 otherwise. 

Example

Input

Output

0001
00111
1111111111
000

Note

In the first test case, a=[1, 5, 3, 4, 2].

  * The 1-compression of a is [1, 5, 3, 4, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 2-compression of a is [1, 3, 3, 2] and it is not a permutation, since 3 appears twice. 
  * The 3-compression of a is [1, 3, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 4-compression of a is [1, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 5-compression of a is [1] and it is a permutation. 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    out = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a) = (rint(), rints())
        (ans, mem) = (['0'] * n, [0] * (n + 1))
        (ans[0], l, r) = ('1', 0, n - 1)
        for i in range(n):
            mem[a[i]] += 1
            if mem[a[i]] == 2:
                ans[0] = '0'
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not mem[i]:
                break
            ans[n - i] = '1'
            if a[l] != i and a[r] != i or a[l] == a[r] == i:
                break
            elif a[l] == i:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        out.append(''.join(ans))
    print('\n'.join(out))


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function generates a binary string of length `n` where the first character is '0' if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise it is '1'. For subsequent characters in the string, starting from the end, the function sets the character to '1' if the integer corresponding to its position from the end (1-indexed) appears exactly once in `a` and meets certain conditions involving the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) positions of the array `a`. The final result is a list of these binary strings, one for each test case, which is then printed to standard output, each on a new line. The function modifies no external state and does not return any value. Edge cases include when `a` contains duplicate values, when `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and when `a` has repeated values but still meets the conditions for setting '1' in the result string.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
