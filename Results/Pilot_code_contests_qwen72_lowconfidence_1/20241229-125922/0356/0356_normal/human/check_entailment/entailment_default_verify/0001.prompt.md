You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers a of length n. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.

The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter k, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length k in a.

More formally, for an array a of length n and an integer k, define the k-compression array of a as an array b of length n-k+1, such that $$$b_j =min_{j≤ i≤ j+k-1}a_i$$$

For example, the 3-compression array of [1, 3, 4, 5, 2] is [min\{1, 3, 4\}, min\{3, 4, 5\}, min\{4, 5, 2\}]=[1, 3, 2].

A permutation of length m is an array consisting of m distinct integers from 1 to m in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (m=3 but there is 4 in the array).

A k-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array a, determine for all 1≤ k≤ n if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of this array or not.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 3⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ n) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 3⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print a binary string of length n. 

The k-th character of the string should be 1 if CodeCook users will be happy after a k-compression of the array a, and 0 otherwise. 

Example

Input


5
5
1 5 3 4 2
4
1 3 2 1
5
1 3 3 3 2
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
3
3 3 2


Output


10111
0001
00111
1111111111
000

Note

In the first test case, a=[1, 5, 3, 4, 2].

  * The 1-compression of a is [1, 5, 3, 4, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 2-compression of a is [1, 3, 3, 2] and it is not a permutation, since 3 appears twice. 
  * The 3-compression of a is [1, 3, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 4-compression of a is [1, 2] and it is a permutation. 
  * The 5-compression of a is [1] and it is a permutation. 
Program:

from sys import stdin

def func():
    rint = lambda : int(stdin.readline())
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    out = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a) = (rint(), rints())
        (ans, mem) = (['0'] * n, [0] * (n + 1))
        (ans[0], l, r) = ('1', 0, n - 1)
        for i in range(n):
            mem[a[i]] += 1
            if mem[a[i]] == 2:
                ans[0] = '0'
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not mem[i]:
                break
            ans[n - i] = '1'
            if a[l] != i and a[r] != i or a[l] == a[r] == i:
                break
            elif a[l] == i:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        out.append(''.join(ans))
    print('\n'.join(out))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the k-compression array is a permutation is flawed. Here is a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Early Termination**:
   - The program initializes the answer array `ans` with all zeros and sets the first element to '1' without checking if the 1-compression array is a permutation. This is incorrect because the 1-compression array should be checked explicitly.
   - The program also prematurely sets `ans[0]` to '0' if any element in the input array `a` appears more than once. This is not the correct approach because the presence of duplicates in the original array does not necessarily mean that the k-compression arrays for all k will not be permutations.

2. **Logic for Checking Permutations**:
   - The program attempts to check if the k-compression array is a permutation by using a sliding window approach and a frequency array `mem`. However, the logic is incomplete and does not correctly handle all edge cases.
   - For example, the program uses a loop to check if the current window contains all numbers from 1 to the window size, but it does not correctly update the window boundaries (`l` and `r`) and the frequency array `mem` for each k.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the input array has repeated elements or where the input array is already a permutation. For example, consider the input array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program should output `11111`, but it may produce incorrect results due to the flawed logic.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output is:
```
11111
```

However, the program might produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly handle the case where the input array is already a permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function generates a binary string of length `n` where the first character is '0' if any integer in `a` appears more than once, otherwise it is '1'. For subsequent characters in the string, starting from the end, the function sets the character to '1' if the integer corresponding to its position from the end (1-indexed) appears exactly once in `a` and meets certain conditions involving the leftmost (`l`) and rightmost (`r`) positions of the array `a`. The final result is a list of these binary strings, one for each test case, which is then printed to standard output, each on a new line. The function modifies no external state and does not return any value. Edge cases include when `a` contains duplicate values, when `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and when `a` has repeated values but still meets the conditions for setting '1' in the result string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
