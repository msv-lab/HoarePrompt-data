Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the polynomial needs to satisfy the condition \( f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod{p} \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( p-1 \). The current implementation constructs a matrix \( A \) and uses `func_1` to solve a system of linear equations, but it does not ensure that the polynomial coefficients \( b_i \) are correctly computed for all inputs.

Specifically, the construction of matrix \( A \) in `func_2` is problematic. The matrix \( A \) is supposed to represent the Vandermonde matrix for the points \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, p-1 \), but the current implementation only constructs a part of it and does not handle the first point \( i = 0 \) correctly. This can lead to incorrect polynomial coefficients being computed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
The expected output is:
```
0 2 0 1 3
```
However, the current implementation may not produce this output because the matrix \( A \) is not constructed correctly for the first point \( i = 0 \).

To fix this, the matrix \( A \) should be constructed as a full \( p \times p \) Vandermonde matrix, and the system of equations should be solved for all \( p \) points. The current implementation only handles \( p-1 \) points, which is insufficient to correctly compute the polynomial coefficients for all inputs.
