Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix `A` is constructed incorrectly. The problem requires constructing a Vandermonde matrix, but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Specifically, the matrix should be constructed such that each row corresponds to the powers of `i` modulo `p`, but the current implementation only multiplies `x` by `i` in a loop without resetting `x` to `i` for each new power.

2. **Polynomial Coefficients Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to solve the system of linear equations to find the coefficients of the polynomial. However, the way the coefficients are calculated and updated is incorrect. The line `x[i] += tmp` should not be inside the loop where `m` is being updated. Additionally, the calculation of `tot` should not include the current index `i`.

3. **Handling of `b[0]`**: The program subtracts `b[0]` from the other elements of `b` before solving the system of equations, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output Function**: The output function `func_3` is used to print the result, but it is not clear why this custom function is needed instead of simply using `print`.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys
from io import StringIO

def func_1(A, b, p):
    """returns x s.t. Ax = b mod p"""
    n = len(A)
    x = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        tot = sum(A[i][j] * x[j] for j in range(n) if j != i)
        x[i] = (b[i] - tot) * pow(A[i][i], p - 2, p) % p
    return x

def func_2():
    p = int(input())
    b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    A = [[pow(i, j, p) for j in range(p)] for i in range(p)]
    x = func_1(A, b, p)
    print(*x)

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    p = int(data[0])
    b = [int(x) for x in data[1].split()]
    A = [[pow(i, j, p) for j in range(p)] for i in range(p)]
    x = func_1(A, b, p)
    print(*x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version constructs the Vandermonde matrix correctly, solves the system of linear equations correctly, and prints the polynomial coefficients as required.
