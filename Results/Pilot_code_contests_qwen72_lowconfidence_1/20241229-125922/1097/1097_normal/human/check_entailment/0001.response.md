Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in how it constructs the matrix `A` and how it solves the system of linear equations. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to solve a system of linear congruences, but the construction of the matrix `A` in `func_2` is incorrect. The matrix `A` should represent the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated at different points, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the powers of `i`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 1
```

The expected output should be a polynomial that satisfies:
- \( f(0) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(2) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)

However, the current implementation of `func_2` constructs the matrix `A` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect solution. The matrix `A` should be constructed as follows:
- For \( i = 0 \): \( [1, 0, 0] \)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [1, 2, 4] \)

But the current implementation constructs it as:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [2, 4, 8] \) (which reduces to \( [2, 1, 2] \) modulo 3)

This incorrect construction leads to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
