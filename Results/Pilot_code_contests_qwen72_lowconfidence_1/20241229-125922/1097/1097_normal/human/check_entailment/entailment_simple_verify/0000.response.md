Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Matrix Construction**: The matrix `A` is constructed incorrectly. The problem requires constructing a Vandermonde matrix, but the current implementation does not do this correctly. Specifically, the matrix should be constructed such that each row corresponds to the powers of `i` modulo `p`, but the current implementation only multiplies `x` by `i` in a loop without resetting `x` to `i` for each new power. This leads to incorrect values in the matrix `A`.

   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotation states that `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`. However, the actual implementation does not reset `x` to `i` for each new power, leading to incorrect values.

2. **Polynomial Coefficients Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to solve the system of linear equations to find the coefficients of the polynomial. However, the way the coefficients are calculated and updated is incorrect. The line `x[i] += tmp` should not be inside the loop where `m` is being updated. Additionally, the calculation of `tot` should not include the current index `i`.

   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotation states that the program returns a list of remainders obtained by dividing each element in `x` by `p`. However, the calculation of `tot` includes the current index `i`, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling of `b[0]`**: The program subtracts `b[0]` from the other elements of `b` before solving the system of equations, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotation states that `b[0]` is added to the result of `func_1`, but this subtraction and addition are not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output Function**: The output function `func_3` is used to print the result, but it is not clear why this custom function is needed instead of simply using `print`.

   - **Annotation Analysis**: The annotation describes the behavior of `func_3` in detail, but it is unnecessarily complex and does not add value over using the built-in `print` function.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description and the annotations support the incorrectness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
