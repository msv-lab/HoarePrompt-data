You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are a prime number p and a sequence of p integers a_0, \ldots, a_{p-1} consisting of zeros and ones.

Find a polynomial of degree at most p-1, f(x) = b_{p-1} x^{p-1} + b_{p-2} x^{p-2} + \ldots + b_0, satisfying the following conditions:

* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), b_i is an integer such that 0 \leq b_i \leq p-1.
* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod p.

Constraints

* 2 \leq p \leq 2999
* p is a prime number.
* 0 \leq a_i \leq 1

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in how it constructs the matrix `A` and how it solves the system of linear equations. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to solve a system of linear congruences, but the construction of the matrix `A` in `func_2` is incorrect. The matrix `A` should represent the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated at different points, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the powers of `i`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 1
```

The expected output should be a polynomial that satisfies:
- \( f(0) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(2) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)

However, the current implementation of `func_2` constructs the matrix `A` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect solution. The matrix `A` should be constructed as follows:
- For \( i = 0 \): \( [1, 0, 0] \)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [1, 2, 4] \)

But the current implementation constructs it as:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [2, 4, 8] \) (which reduces to \( [2, 1, 2] \) modulo 3)

This incorrect construction leads to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
