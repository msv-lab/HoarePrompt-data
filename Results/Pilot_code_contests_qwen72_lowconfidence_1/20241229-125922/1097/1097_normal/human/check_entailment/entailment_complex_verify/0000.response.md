Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

1. **Matrix Construction Issue**:
   - The matrix `A` is constructed incorrectly. According to the problem, we need to construct a Vandermonde matrix where each row corresponds to the powers of `i` modulo `p`. However, in the current implementation:
     ```python
     for (i, Ai) in enumerate(A):
         i += 1
         x = i
         for j in range(p - 1):
             Ai[j] = x
             x *= i
             x %= p
     ```
     The variable `x` is not reset to `i` for each new power, leading to incorrect values in the matrix. This is a significant issue because the matrix `A` must accurately represent the powers of `i` modulo `p`.

2. **Polynomial Coefficients Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to solve the system of linear equations to find the coefficients of the polynomial. However, the way the coefficients are calculated and updated is incorrect:
     ```python
     tot = sum(Ai[k] * x[k] for k in range(len(A)))
     tmp = pow(Ai[-1], p - 2, p) * (b[i] - tot) % p
     x[i] += tmp
     m *= p
     ```
     - The calculation of `tot` should not include the current index `i`.
     - The line `x[i] += tmp` should not be inside the loop where `m` is being updated.
     - The variable `m` is not used in the final result and seems to be unnecessary.

3. **Handling of `b[0]`**:
   - The program subtracts `b[0]` from the other elements of `b` before solving the system of equations:
     ```python
     func_3(*([b[0]] + func_1(A, [(b[i] - b[0]) for i in range(1, p)], p)))
     ```
     This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The polynomial coefficients should be calculated directly from the given `b` values.

4. **Output Function**:
   - The output function `func_3` is used to print the result, but it is not clear why this custom function is needed instead of simply using `print`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment of **False** is accurate because the program does not correctly construct the Vandermonde matrix, does not correctly calculate the polynomial coefficients, and unnecessarily modifies the `b` values. These issues prevent the program from meeting the problem description and producing the correct polynomial coefficients. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
