You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given are a prime number p and a sequence of p integers a_0, \ldots, a_{p-1} consisting of zeros and ones.

Find a polynomial of degree at most p-1, f(x) = b_{p-1} x^{p-1} + b_{p-2} x^{p-2} + \ldots + b_0, satisfying the following conditions:

* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), b_i is an integer such that 0 \leq b_i \leq p-1.
* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod p.

Constraints

* 2 \leq p \leq 2999
* p is a prime number.
* 0 \leq a_i \leq 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


p
a_0 a_1 \ldots a_{p-1}


Output

Print b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{p-1} of a polynomial f(x) satisfying the conditions, in this order, with spaces in between.

It can be proved that a solution always exists. If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
