Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program aims to find a polynomial \( f(x) \) of degree at most \( p-1 \) that satisfies the conditions given in the problem description. However, there are several issues with the provided code that prevent it from meeting the requirements:

1. **Matrix Construction and Linear Algebra**:
   - The program constructs a matrix \( A \) and attempts to solve the linear system \( Ax = b \) using modular arithmetic. However, the construction of the matrix \( A \) is incorrect. The matrix should represent the Vandermonde matrix for the polynomial interpolation, but the current construction does not correctly set up the matrix for this purpose.

2. **Polynomial Interpolation**:
   - The program attempts to use a linear algebra approach to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial. However, the correct method for polynomial interpolation over a finite field (like the one described in the problem) is typically Lagrange interpolation or another method specifically designed for this purpose. The current approach using a linear system solver is not guaranteed to work correctly for all inputs.

3. **Function Definitions and Calls**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to solve the linear system, but it does not correctly handle the construction of the matrix \( A \) and the vector \( b \). The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with incorrect parameters, leading to potential errors in the solution.
   - The function `func_3` is a custom print function, but it is not called with the correct arguments. The program should print the coefficients of the polynomial, but the way `func_3` is called does not ensure that the correct values are printed.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The problem description requires the output to be a list of coefficients \( b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{p-1} \) separated by spaces. The current implementation does not guarantee that the output will be in the correct format.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
The expected output is:
```
0 2 0 1 3
```
However, the current program will likely produce an incorrect output because of the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the polynomial interpolation required by the problem description. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
