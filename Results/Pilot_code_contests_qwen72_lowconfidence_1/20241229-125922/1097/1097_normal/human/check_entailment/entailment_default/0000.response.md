Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from fully meeting the problem description for every potential case:

1. **Matrix Construction in `func_2`**: The matrix `A` is constructed incorrectly. The problem requires finding a polynomial of degree at most \( p-1 \) such that \( f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod{p} \) for each \( i \) in the range \( 0 \leq i \leq p-1 \). The matrix `A` should represent the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated at each point \( i \). However, the current construction of `A` only includes powers of \( i \) from \( i^1 \) to \( i^{p-1} \), which is incorrect because it misses the constant term \( i^0 \).

2. **Handling the Constant Term**: The function `func_2` attempts to handle the constant term by subtracting the first element of `b` from the rest of the elements before solving the system. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the constant term in the polynomial. The correct approach would be to construct the matrix `A` to include the constant term and solve the system directly.

3. **Edge Cases**: While the code handles some edge cases, such as the input being a valid prime number and the sequence of zeros and ones, it does not handle the case where \( p = 2 \) correctly. For \( p = 2 \), the matrix `A` should be a \( 1 \times 1 \) matrix, but the current implementation constructs a \( 1 \times 0 \) matrix, which is invalid.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The modular inverse calculation in `func_1` assumes that the last element of each row in `A` is non-zero. If any element in the last column of `A` is zero, the modular inverse calculation will fail, leading to a `ZeroDivisionError`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
