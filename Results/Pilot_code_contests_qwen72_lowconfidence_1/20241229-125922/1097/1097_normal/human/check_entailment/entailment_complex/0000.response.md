Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input list `b` has only one element (i.e., `p = 1`). According to the problem description, `p` must be a prime number between 2 and 2999, so this specific edge case is not explicitly mentioned. However, the code does not account for the scenario where `p` is the smallest possible prime number, which is 2. When `p = 2`, the construction of the matrix `A` in `func_2` results in an empty matrix because the loop runs from 1 to `p-1`, which is 1 in this case. This leads to an incorrect setup for `func_1`, which expects a non-empty matrix. Therefore, the program fails to correctly handle the smallest valid input case, making it incorrect.
