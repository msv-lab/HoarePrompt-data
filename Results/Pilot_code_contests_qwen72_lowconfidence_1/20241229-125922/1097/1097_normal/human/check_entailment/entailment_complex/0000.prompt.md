You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), b_i is an integer such that 0 \leq b_i \leq p-1.
* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod p.

Constraints

* 2 \leq p \leq 2999
* p is a prime number.
* 0 \leq a_i \leq 1

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of lists of integers where each sublist has the same length and represents a row in a matrix; b is a list of integers of the same length as A; p is a prime number such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2999.
def func_1(A, b, p):
    """returns x s.t. Ax = b mod p"""
    x = [0] * len(A)
    m = 1
    for (i, Ai) in enumerate(A):
        tot = sum(Ai[k] * x[k] for k in range(len(A)))
        
        tmp = pow(Ai[-1], p - 2, p) * (b[i] - tot) % p
        
        x[i] += tmp
        
        m *= p
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    return [(xi % p) for xi in x]
    #The program returns a list of remainders obtained by dividing each element in `x` by `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `A`, a list of lists of integers representing a matrix; `b`, a list of integers of the same length as the number of rows in `A`; and `p`, a prime number between 2 and 2999. The function aims to solve the equation `Ax = b mod p` for `x`. It initializes `x` as a list of zeros with the same length as `A`. For each row `Ai` in `A`, it calculates a temporary value `tmp` which is the modular inverse of the last element in `Ai` multiplied by the difference between the corresponding element in `b` and the dot product of `Ai` and the current state of `x`, all taken modulo `p`. This `tmp` value is then added to the corresponding position in `x`. After processing all rows, the function returns a list of remainders obtained by dividing each element in `x` by `p`. 

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `A` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list.
- If `A` is not a square matrix or `b` does not have the same length as the number of rows in `A`, the function may produce unexpected results or raise an error.
- If any element in the last column of `A` is zero, the modular inverse calculation will fail, leading to a ZeroDivisionError.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2999 and p is a prime number; b is a list of integers of length p where each element bi is either 0 or 1.
def func_2():
    p = int(input())
    b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    A = [([0] * (p - 1)) for _ in range(p - 1)]
    for (i, Ai) in enumerate(A):
        i += 1
        
        x = i
        
        for j in range(p - 1):
            Ai[j] = x
            x *= i
            x %= p
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`.
    func_3(*([b[0]] + func_1(A, [(b[i] - b[0]) for i in range(1, p)], p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `p` and a list `b` of integers from the user input. It then constructs a 2D list `A` of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`. After constructing `A`, it calls another function `func_3` with arguments derived from `b` and `A`. Specifically, it passes the first element of `b` and the result of calling `func_1` with `A`, a modified version of `b` (excluding the first element and adjusted by subtracting the first element of `b`), and `p`. The function does not return any value directly; its primary purpose is to prepare and pass data to `func_3`. Edge cases include the handling of the input values, ensuring `p` is a prime number within the specified range, and that `b` is a list of length `p` with elements being either 0 or 1.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the values, file is a file-like object where the output will be written, end is a string appended after the last value, and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_3():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `' '`, `file` has the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, the last element is followed by `end`, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged, and `at_start` is `True`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is `' '`, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified), `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `file`, or `end` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`. If `flush` is `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains `flush` and `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) and optional keyword arguments (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified `file` object, separating them by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space if not provided). After writing all elements, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline if not provided). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the function forcibly flushes the `file` object. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file` except the `end` string. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present. The final state of the program is that `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and `kwargs` does not contain the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` if they were initially present. If `flush` is `True`, `file` is flushed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
