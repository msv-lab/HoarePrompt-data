You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are a prime number p and a sequence of p integers a_0, \ldots, a_{p-1} consisting of zeros and ones.

Find a polynomial of degree at most p-1, f(x) = b_{p-1} x^{p-1} + b_{p-2} x^{p-2} + \ldots + b_0, satisfying the following conditions:

* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), b_i is an integer such that 0 \leq b_i \leq p-1.
* For each i (0 \leq i \leq p-1), f(i) \equiv a_i \pmod p.

Constraints

* 2 \leq p \leq 2999
* p is a prime number.
* 0 \leq a_i \leq 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


p
a_0 a_1 \ldots a_{p-1}


Output

Print b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{p-1} of a polynomial f(x) satisfying the conditions, in this order, with spaces in between.

It can be proved that a solution always exists. If multiple solutions exist, any of them will be accepted.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue in how it constructs the matrix `A` and how it solves the system of linear equations. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to solve a system of linear congruences, but the construction of the matrix `A` in `func_2` is incorrect. The matrix `A` should represent the coefficients of the polynomial evaluated at different points, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the powers of `i`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 0 1
```

The expected output should be a polynomial that satisfies:
- \( f(0) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \)
- \( f(2) \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)

However, the current implementation of `func_2` constructs the matrix `A` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect solution. The matrix `A` should be constructed as follows:
- For \( i = 0 \): \( [1, 0, 0] \)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [1, 2, 4] \)

But the current implementation constructs it as:
- For \( i = 1 \): \( [1, 1, 1] \)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( [2, 4, 8] \) (which reduces to \( [2, 1, 2] \) modulo 3)

This incorrect construction leads to an incorrect solution. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) and optional keyword arguments (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified `file` object, separating them by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space if not provided). After writing all elements, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline if not provided). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the function forcibly flushes the `file` object. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file` except the `end` string. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present. The final state of the program is that `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and `kwargs` does not contain the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` if they were initially present. If `flush` is `True`, `file` is flushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
