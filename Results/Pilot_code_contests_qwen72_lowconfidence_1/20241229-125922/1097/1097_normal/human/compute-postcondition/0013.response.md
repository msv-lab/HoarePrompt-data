To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `args` is a tuple containing at least two elements.
- `sep` is `' '`.
- `file` has the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '` and the string representation of `x` (which is the second element in `args`) written to it.
- `end` is a string appended after the last value.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `x` is the second element in `args`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `args` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the second element in `args`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the third element in `args`.

### Adjusted State:
- `x` should now be the third element in `args`.
- Since `x` is the third element, `args` must have at least three elements for the loop to execute one more time.
- The `file` will have the string representation of the first element of `args`, followed by a space, followed by the string representation of the second element of `args`, followed by another space, and then the string representation of the third element of `args`.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` has the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, and the string representation of the third element of `args` written to it, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
