The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` (which is the third element in `args`) to the file object `file`.

- `args` remains unchanged as a tuple containing at least three elements.
- `sep` remains `' '`.
- `file` now contains the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, and the string representation of the third element of `args` again (appended by the current operation).
- `not at_start` remains true, so an additional space `' '` is still appended after the third element.
- `end` remains a string appended after the last value.
- `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present.
- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `x` remains the third element in `args`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` has the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, and the string representation of the third element of `args` again, `not at_start` is true, an additional space `' '` is appended after the third element, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
