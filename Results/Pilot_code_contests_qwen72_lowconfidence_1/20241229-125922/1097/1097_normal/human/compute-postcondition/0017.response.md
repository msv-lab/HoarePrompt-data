The line `at_start = False` reassigns the variable `at_start` to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` has the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, and the string representation of the third element of `args` again, `not at_start` is true, an additional space `' '` is appended after the third element, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
