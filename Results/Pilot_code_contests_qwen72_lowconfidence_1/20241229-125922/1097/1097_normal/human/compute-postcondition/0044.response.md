The value of `x` is updated to `x * i`. Given that `i` is 5 and `x` is `25 % p`, the new value of `x` is `(25 % p) * 5`.

Since `p` is an integer greater than 1, the value of `25 % p` can vary depending on `p`. However, regardless of the value of `p`, the calculation for `x` will be `(25 % p) * 5`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`, `x` is `(25 % p) * 5`, `j` is `p - 1`.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`, `x` is `(25 % p) * 5`, `j` is `p - 1`**
