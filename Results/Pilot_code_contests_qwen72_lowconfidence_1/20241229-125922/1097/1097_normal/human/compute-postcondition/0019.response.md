The line of code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of the `end` parameter (or a newline character `\n` if `end` is not specified) to `file`. The `pop` method removes `end` from `kwargs` and returns its value, which is then written to `file`. After this operation, `kwargs` no longer contains `end`.

- `args` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `sep` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `file` now contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified).
- `flush` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `kwargs` no longer contains `end` if it was present.
- `at_start` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `' '`, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified), `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `file`, or `end` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`.**
