The value of `x` is updated by multiplying its current value by the value of `i`. Given that `x` was initially equal to `Ai[p - 1]` and `j` is `p - 1`, the only change in the state is the new value of `x`.

Output State: **`j` is `p - 1`, `Ai[p - 1]` is `x`, `x` is `x * i`, the loop will not execute another iteration.**
