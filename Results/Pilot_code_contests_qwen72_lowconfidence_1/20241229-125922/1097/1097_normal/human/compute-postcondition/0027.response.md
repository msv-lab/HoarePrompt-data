The code snippet `Ai[j] = x` updates the element at index `j` in the sublist `Ai` with the value of `x`. Given that `x` is `9 % p`, and `j` is 1, the element `Ai[1]` will be updated to the value of `9 % p`.

- `p` is an integer greater than 1, so `9 % p` will depend on the value of `p`. However, since `p` is greater than 1, the value of `9 % p` will be a non-negative integer less than `p`.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, and this remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 3.
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, and now `Ai[1]` is set to `9 % p`.
- `x` is `9 % p`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, `x` is `9 % p`, `j` is 1**.
