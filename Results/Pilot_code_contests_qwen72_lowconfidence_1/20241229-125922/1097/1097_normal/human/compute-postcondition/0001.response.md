The code initializes the variable `at_start` to `True`. This operation does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes this new assignment while retaining the initial conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `' '`, `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `True`**
