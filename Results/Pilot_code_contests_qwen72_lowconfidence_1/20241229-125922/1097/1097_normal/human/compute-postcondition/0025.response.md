The code snippet `x %= p` modifies the value of `x` by taking the remainder of `x` divided by `p`. Given that `x` is 9 and `p` is an integer greater than 1, the new value of `x` will be the remainder when 9 is divided by `p`.

Since `p` is greater than 1, the possible remainders when 9 is divided by `p` depend on the value of `p`:
- If `p` is 2, then `x` becomes 1.
- If `p` is 3, then `x` becomes 0.
- If `p` is 4, then `x` becomes 1.
- If `p` is 5, then `x` becomes 4.
- If `p` is 6, then `x` becomes 3.
- If `p` is 7, then `x` becomes 2.
- If `p` is 8, then `x` becomes 1.
- If `p` is 9, then `x` becomes 0.
- If `p` is greater than 9, then `x` remains 9.

Therefore, the value of `x` after the operation will be `9 % p`.

The other variables (`p`, `b`, `A`, `i`, `Ai`, and `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `x` is `9 % p`, `j` is 0**
