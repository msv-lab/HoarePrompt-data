To analyze the given Python code snippet and determine its impact on the program state, let's break down the components and their effects:

### Initial State:
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_3(*([b[0]] + func_1(A, [(b[i] - b[0]) for i in range(1, p)], p)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**:
   - `[(b[i] - b[0]) for i in range(1, p)]`: This creates a new list where each element is `b[i] - b[0]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p-1`.
   - Let's denote this new list as `b_diff`.

2. **Function Call `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(A, b_diff, p)`: This function is called with `A`, `b_diff`, and `p` as arguments.
   - The return value of `func_1` is not specified, but let's assume it returns a list, which we will call `result_1`.

3. **List Concatenation**:
   - `[b[0]] + result_1`: This concatenates the first element of `b` with the list `result_1`.
   - Let's denote this concatenated list as `concat_list`.

4. **Function Call `func_3`**:
   - `func_3(*concat_list)`: This function is called with the elements of `concat_list` unpacked as separate arguments.
   - The return value of `func_3` is not specified, but let's assume it returns a value, which we will call `result_3`.

### Impact on Variables:
- The variables `p`, `b`, and `A` remain unchanged because they are only used as inputs to the functions.
- The specific values of `result_1` and `result_3` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and `func_3`, which are not provided.

### Output State:
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`.
- The value of `func_3`'s return, `result_3`, is returned.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`, and `result_3` is returned.**
