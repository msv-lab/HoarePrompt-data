The values of `sep` and `file` are updated based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If `sep` is present in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `sep`; otherwise, `sep` is set to `' '`. Similarly, if `file` is present in `kwargs`, its value is assigned to `file`; otherwise, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `sep` and `file` if they were present.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `' '`, `file` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present.**
