The code snippet `x %= p` updates the value of `x` to `x % p`. Given the initial state:

- `x` is `(9 % p) * 3`.
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.

The value of `x` after the operation will be `((9 % p) * 3) % p`.

The other variables remain unchanged:

- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
- `i` is 3.
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`.
- `j` is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, `x` is `((9 % p) * 3) % p`, `j` is 1**.
