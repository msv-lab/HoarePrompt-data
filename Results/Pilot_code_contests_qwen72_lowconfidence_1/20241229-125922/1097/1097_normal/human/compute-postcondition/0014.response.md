The code snippet `file.write(sep)` appends the string stored in `sep` to the content of the file object `file`. Given that `sep` is `' '`, a space character will be added to the file.

- `args` remains a tuple containing at least three elements.
- `sep` remains `' '`.
- `file` now contains the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space, the string representation of the third element of `args`, and an additional space due to the `write(sep)` operation.
- `end` remains a string appended after the last value.
- `flush` remains a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present.
- `at_start` remains `False`.
- `x` remains the third element in `args`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `sep` is `' '`, `file` has the string representation of the first element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the second element of `args` followed by a space `' '`, the string representation of the third element of `args` followed by an additional space, `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the third element in `args`.**
