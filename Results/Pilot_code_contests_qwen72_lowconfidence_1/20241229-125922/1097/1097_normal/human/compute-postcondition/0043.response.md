The code `Ai[j] = x` updates the value of the last element (`j = p - 1`) in the fourth sublist (`Ai`) of the 2D list `A`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `p` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
   - `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3` and the last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5.
   - `x` is `25 % p`.
   - `j` is `p - 1`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `Ai[j] = x` sets the last element of `Ai` (which is `Ai[p-1]`) to the value of `x`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `x` is calculated as `25 % p`.
   - `j` is `p - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `Ai`.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - The last element of `Ai` is now `25 % p`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
- `i` is 5.
- `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`.
- `x` is `25 % p`.
- `j` is `p - 1`.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`, `x` is `25 % p`, `j` is `p - 1`**.
