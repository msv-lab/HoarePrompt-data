The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. 

- `p` is an integer such that 2 ≤ p ≤ 2999 and `p` is a prime number.
- `b` is a list of integers of length `p`, where each element `bi` is either 0 or 1.

The function's output is not explicitly provided, so we need to infer based on the given parameters. Given the constraints, a reasonable assumption is that the function processes the list `b` in some way that depends on the prime number `p`.

Since the output is not specified, I'll describe the parameters and leave the output open-ended.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `p`, which is a prime number between 2 and 2999, and a list `b` of length `p` where each element is either 0 or 1. The function returns a value based on the processing of `b` using `p`, but the specific return value is not defined.**
