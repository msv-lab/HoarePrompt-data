The code snippet `x *= i` multiplies the current value of `x` by the value of `i`. Given the initial state:

- `x` is `9 % p`.
- `i` is 3.

Therefore, `x` will be updated to `(9 % p) * 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged:

- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
- `i` remains 3.
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`.
- `j` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, `x` is `(9 % p) * 3`, `j` is 1**.
