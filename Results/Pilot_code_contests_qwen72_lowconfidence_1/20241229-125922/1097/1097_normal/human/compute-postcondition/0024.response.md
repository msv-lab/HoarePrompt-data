Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) and optional keyword arguments (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified `file` object, separating them by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space if not provided). After writing all elements, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline if not provided). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the function forcibly flushes the `file` object. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file` except the `end` string. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present. The final state of the program is that `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and `kwargs` does not contain the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` if they were initially present. If `flush` is `True`, `file` is flushed. **
