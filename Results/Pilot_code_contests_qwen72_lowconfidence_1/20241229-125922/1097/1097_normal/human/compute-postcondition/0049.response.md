`x` is updated to the result of `x % p`. The value of `x` was previously `x * i`, and `j` is `p - 1`. The value of `Ai[p - 1]` remains `x` before the modulo operation. The loop will not execute another iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`j` is `p - 1`, `Ai[p - 1]` is `x * i % p`, `x` is `x * i % p`, the loop will not execute another iteration.**
