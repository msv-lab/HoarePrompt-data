The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 4, so the new value of `i` is 5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 2`, `x` is `3^(p-1) % p`, `j` is `p - 2`**
