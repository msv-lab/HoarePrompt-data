If `not at_start` is true, an additional space `' '` is appended after the third element, and `end` is a string appended after the last value, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the third element in `args`.***
