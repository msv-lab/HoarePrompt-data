The code `x *= i` multiplies the current value of `x` by `i` and assigns the result back to `x`.

- Initial value of `x` is 5.
- Value of `i` is 5.

So, `x` becomes `5 * 5`, which is 25.

The rest of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3` and the last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, `x` is 25, `j` is `p - 2`.**
