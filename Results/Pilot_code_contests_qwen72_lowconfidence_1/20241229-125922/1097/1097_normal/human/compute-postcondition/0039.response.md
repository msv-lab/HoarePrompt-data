The code `Ai[j] = x` updates the value of the element in the `Ai` list at the index `j` to the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 5 and `j` is `p - 2`, the last element of the fourth sublist in `A` (which is `Ai`) will be set to 5.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3` and the last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, `x` is 5, `j` is `p - 2`.**
