The value of `x` is updated by performing `x %= p`, which means `x` is set to `x % p`.

From the initial state:
- `x` is `(((9 % p) * 3) % p) * 3`.
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.

First, calculate `9 % p`:
- Let `k = 9 % p`.

Then, calculate `((9 % p) * 3) % p`:
- Let `l = (k * 3) % p`.

Finally, `x` is `l * 3`:
- `x = l * 3`.

After applying `x %= p`:
- `x` becomes `(l * 3) % p`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
- `i` is 3.
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, and `Ai[2]` set to `((9 % p) * 3) % p`.
- `x` is `(((9 % p) * 3) % p) * 3 % p`.
- `j` is 2.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, and `Ai[2]` set to `((9 % p) * 3) % p`, `x` is `(((9 % p) * 3) % p) * 3 % p`, `j` is 2.**
