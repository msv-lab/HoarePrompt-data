Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is `' '`, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified), `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `file`, or `end` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`. If `flush` is `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains `flush` and `file` has been flushed.***
