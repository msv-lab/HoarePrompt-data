The `file.flush()` method is called, which forces the stream to write out any buffered data to the file. Since the `flush` variable was already set to `True`, this operation ensures that the content is immediately written to the file.

The values of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `flush`, `kwargs`, and `at_start` remain unchanged except for the action performed on `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is `' '`, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified), `flush` is `True`, `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `file`, or `end` if they were present, `kwargs` no longer contains `flush`, `at_start` is `False`, and `file` has been flushed.**
