The code `x *= i` multiplies the current value of `x` by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `x` is updated to `x * 3`.

From the initial state:
- `x` is `((9 % p) * 3) % p`.
- `i` is 3.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(((9 % p) * 3) % p) * 3`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, and `Ai[2]` set to `((9 % p) * 3) % p`, `x` is `(((9 % p) * 3) % p) * 3`, `j` is 2**
