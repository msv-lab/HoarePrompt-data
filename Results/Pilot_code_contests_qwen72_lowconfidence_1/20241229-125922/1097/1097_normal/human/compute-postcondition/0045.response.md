The code snippet `x %= p` modifies the value of `x` to be `x % p`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation:

- `x` was initially `(25 % p) * 5`.
- After the operation `x %= p`, `x` becomes `((25 % p) * 5) % p`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s.
- `i` is 5.
- `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`.
- `x` is `(25 % p) * 5`.
- `j` is `p - 1`.

After the code execution, the value of `x` is updated to `((25 % p) * 5) % p`.

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 5, `Ai` is the fourth sublist in `A` with each element `Ai[j]` set to `3^(j+1) % p` for `j` from 0 to `p - 3`, the second-to-last element `Ai[p-2]` set to 5, and the last element `Ai[p-1]` set to `25 % p`, `x` is `((25 % p) * 5) % p`, `j` is `p - 1`**.
