The code `Ai[j] = x` updates the element at index `j` of the sublist `Ai` with the value of `x`. Given the initial state:

- `p` is an integer greater than 1
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s
- `i` is 3
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3 and `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`
- `x` is `((9 % p) * 3) % p`
- `j` is 2

We need to determine the new value of `Ai[j]` after executing `Ai[j] = x`.

1. Calculate `x`:
   - `x = ((9 % p) * 3) % p`
   - Since `9 % p` is a value between 0 and `p-1`, let's denote it as `k` where `k = 9 % p`.
   - Then, `x = (k * 3) % p`

2. Update `Ai[j]`:
   - `Ai[j] = x`
   - Since `j` is 2, `Ai[2]` will be updated to `x`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `p` is an integer greater than 1
- `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input
- `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s
- `i` is 3
- `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, and `Ai[2]` set to `((9 % p) * 3) % p`
- `x` is `((9 % p) * 3) % p`
- `j` is 2

Output State: **`p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` with the first sublist filled with 1s, `i` is 3, `Ai` is the third sublist in `A` with `Ai[0]` set to 3, `Ai[1]` set to `9 % p`, and `Ai[2]` set to `((9 % p) * 3) % p`, `x` is `((9 % p) * 3) % p`, `j` is 2**
