    return [(xi % p) for xi in x]
    #The program returns a list of remainders obtained by dividing each element in `x` by `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `A`, a list of lists of integers representing a matrix; `b`, a list of integers of the same length as the number of rows in `A`; and `p`, a prime number between 2 and 2999. The function aims to solve the equation `Ax = b mod p` for `x`. It initializes `x` as a list of zeros with the same length as `A`. For each row `Ai` in `A`, it calculates a temporary value `tmp` which is the modular inverse of the last element in `Ai` multiplied by the difference between the corresponding element in `b` and the dot product of `Ai` and the current state of `x`, all taken modulo `p`. This `tmp` value is then added to the corresponding position in `x`. After processing all rows, the function returns a list of remainders obtained by dividing each element in `x` by `p`. 

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `A` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list.
- If `A` is not a square matrix or `b` does not have the same length as the number of rows in `A`, the function may produce unexpected results or raise an error.
- If any element in the last column of `A` is zero, the modular inverse calculation will fail, leading to a ZeroDivisionError.

def func_2():
    p = int(input())
    b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    A = [([0] * (p - 1)) for _ in range(p - 1)]
    for (i, Ai) in enumerate(A):
        i += 1
        
        x = i
        
        for j in range(p - 1):
            Ai[j] = x
            x *= i
            x %= p
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a list of integers derived from the user's input, `A` is a 2D list of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`.
    func_3(*([b[0]] + func_1(A, [(b[i] - b[0]) for i in range(1, p)], p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `p` and a list `b` of integers from the user input. It then constructs a 2D list `A` of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`. After constructing `A`, it calls another function `func_3` with arguments derived from `b` and `A`. Specifically, it passes the first element of `b` and the result of calling `func_1` with `A`, a modified version of `b` (excluding the first element and adjusted by subtracting the first element of `b`), and `p`. The function does not return any value directly; its primary purpose is to prepare and pass data to `func_3`. Edge cases include the handling of the input values, ensuring `p` is a prime number within the specified range, and that `b` is a list of length `p` with elements being either 0 or 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the values, file is a file-like object where the output will be written, end is a string appended after the last value, and flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_3():

    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is the value from `kwargs` if present, otherwise `' '`, `file` has the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, the last element is followed by `end`, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep` or `file` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`. If `args` is empty, `file` remains unchanged, and `at_start` is `True`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is `' '`, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `end` (or `\n` if `end` was not specified), `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `kwargs` does not contain `sep`, `file`, or `end` if they were present, `at_start` is `False`. If `flush` is `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains `flush` and `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a variable number of arguments (`args`) and optional keyword arguments (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to the specified `file` object, separating them by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space if not provided). After writing all elements, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline if not provided). If the `flush` parameter is `True`, the function forcibly flushes the `file` object. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file` except the `end` string. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present. The final state of the program is that `file` contains the concatenated string of `args` elements separated by `sep` and followed by `end`, and `kwargs` does not contain the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, or `flush` if they were initially present. If `flush` is `True`, `file` is flushed.
