The function `func_2` reads an integer `p` and a list `b` of integers from the user input. It then constructs a 2D list `A` of size `(p - 1) x (p - 1)` where each element `A[i-1][j]` is equal to `i^(j+1) % p` for `i` ranging from 1 to `p - 1` and `j` ranging from 0 to `p - 2`. After constructing `A`, it calls another function `func_3` with arguments derived from `b` and `A`. Specifically, it passes the first element of `b` and the result of calling `func_1` with `A`, a modified version of `b` (excluding the first element and adjusted by subtracting the first element of `b`), and `p`. The function does not return any value directly; its primary purpose is to prepare and pass data to `func_3`. Edge cases include the handling of the input values, ensuring `p` is a prime number within the specified range, and that `b` is a list of length `p` with elements being either 0 or 1.
