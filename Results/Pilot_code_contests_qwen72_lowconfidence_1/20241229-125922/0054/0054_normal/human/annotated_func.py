#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\). It returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`. The function correctly identifies prime numbers up to `N` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The returned list `P` contains all integers from 2 to `N` that are prime. Edge cases, such as when `N` is 1 or 2, are handled appropriately: if `N` is 1, the function returns an empty list, and if `N` is 2, it returns a list containing only the number 2.

For each block, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, and `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.

    #The program returns `primes`, which is a non-empty list containing the original primes from `func_1(SQRT_N)` and all the new primes from `new_primes`. The original primes are those up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, and the new primes are those found in the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` inclusive, specifically the values `n` where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `N` and `block_size`, where `N` is an integer greater than 1 and `block_size` is a positive integer. It returns a non-empty list `primes` that contains all prime numbers up to and including `N`. The function first computes the primes up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N` using a helper function `func_1`. It then extends this list with additional primes found in the range from the square root of `N` to `N` using a segmented sieve approach. Each segment is processed in blocks of size `block_size`. The final list `primes` includes all primes in the specified range, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining the order. Potential edge cases include when `N` is very close to a perfect square, or when `block_size` is large relative to the range being sieved. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring that all necessary blocks are processed and all primes are identified.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13. It processes `N` based on its value relative to a predefined block size of 30,000. If `N` is less than or equal to 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_1(N)`. If `N` is greater than 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_2(N, 30000)`. The function ensures that the appropriate sub-function (`func_1` or `func_2`) is called based on the value of `N`, and the final state of the program is the return value of the chosen sub-function. Edge cases, such as `N` being exactly 30,000, are correctly handled by calling `func_1(N)`.

Since `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N` if `N` is different from `NN`), and the length of `D` is not equal to 2, the product is calculated using the first two elements of `D`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13) and returns a tuple. The function attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and processes them to determine the return value based on the following cases:
