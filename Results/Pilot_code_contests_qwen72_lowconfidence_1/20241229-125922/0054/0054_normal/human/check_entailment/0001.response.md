Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case when the input number `q` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if the number `q` is a prime, the first player cannot make a move and should win immediately by printing `1` and `0`. However, the function `func_4` does not correctly identify this case and may return incorrect results.

For example, if the input `q` is a prime number like `7`, the program should output:
```
1
0
```
However, the current implementation of `func_4` will not handle this correctly. The function `func_4` checks for divisors and appends them to the list `D`, but it does not correctly handle the case where `N` is a prime number. Specifically, the condition `if N != NN:` will always be true for composite numbers, but it will not be true for prime numbers, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this, the function `func_4` should explicitly check if `N` is a prime number and return `(1, 0)` in that case. This would ensure that the program works correctly for all inputs, including prime numbers.
