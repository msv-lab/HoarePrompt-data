You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You can't possibly imagine how cold our friends are this winter in Nvodsk! Two of them play the following game to warm up: initially a piece of paper has an integer q. During a move a player should write any integer number that is a non-trivial divisor of the last written number. Then he should run this number of circles around the hotel. Let us remind you that a number's divisor is called non-trivial if it is different from one and from the divided number itself. 

The first person who can't make a move wins as he continues to lie in his warm bed under three blankets while the other one keeps running. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally. If the first player wins, print any winning first move.

Input

The first line contains the only integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1013).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Output

In the first line print the number of the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line should contain another integer — his first move (if the first player can't even make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

6


Output

2


Input

30


Output

1
6


Input

1


Output

1
0

Note

Number 6 has only two non-trivial divisors: 2 and 3. It is impossible to make a move after the numbers 2 and 3 are written, so both of them are winning, thus, number 6 is the losing number. A player can make a move and write number 6 after number 30; 6, as we know, is a losing number. Thus, this move will bring us the victory.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```

from math import sqrt

ifs = sys.stdin
ofs = sys.stdout
N = int(ifs.readline())
(player, move) = func_4(N)
ofs.write('%d\n' % player)
if player == 1:
    ofs.write('%d\n' % move)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\), `primes` is a list of length `N + 1` where `primes[i]` is `True` if and only if `i` is a prime number, and `primes[0]` and `primes[1]` are `False`.

    return P
    #The program returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`, where `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\).

For each block, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, and `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`. After all iterations, `new_primes` contains all integers in the range `[SQRT_N + 1, N]` that are not divisible by any prime in `primes`.

    return primes

The original primes are those up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, and the new primes are those found in the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` inclusive, specifically the values `n` where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`.

Since `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N` if `N` is different from `NN`), and the length of `D` is not equal to 2, the product is calculated using the first two elements of `D`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
