You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You can't possibly imagine how cold our friends are this winter in Nvodsk! Two of them play the following game to warm up: initially a piece of paper has an integer q. During a move a player should write any integer number that is a non-trivial divisor of the last written number. Then he should run this number of circles around the hotel. Let us remind you that a number's divisor is called non-trivial if it is different from one and from the divided number itself. 

The first person who can't make a move wins as he continues to lie in his warm bed under three blankets while the other one keeps running. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally. If the first player wins, print any winning first move.

Input

The first line contains the only integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1013).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Output

In the first line print the number of the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line should contain another integer — his first move (if the first player can't even make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

6


Output

2


Input

30


Output

1
6


Input

1


Output

1
0

Note

Number 6 has only two non-trivial divisors: 2 and 3. It is impossible to make a move after the numbers 2 and 3 are written, so both of them are winning, thus, number 6 is the losing number. A player can make a move and write number 6 after number 30; 6, as we know, is a losing number. Thus, this move will bring us the victory.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case when the input number `q` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if the number `q` is a prime, the first player cannot make a move and should win immediately by printing `1` and `0`. However, the function `func_4` does not correctly identify this case and may return incorrect results.

For example, if the input `q` is a prime number like `7`, the program should output:
```
1
0
```
However, the current implementation of `func_4` will not handle this correctly. The function `func_4` checks for divisors and appends them to the list `D`, but it does not correctly handle the case where `N` is a prime number. Specifically, the condition `if N != NN:` will always be true for composite numbers, but it will not be true for prime numbers, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this, the function `func_4` should explicitly check if `N` is a prime number and return `(1, 0)` in that case. This would ensure that the program works correctly for all inputs, including prime numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13) and returns a tuple. The function attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and processes them to determine the return value based on the following cases:

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
