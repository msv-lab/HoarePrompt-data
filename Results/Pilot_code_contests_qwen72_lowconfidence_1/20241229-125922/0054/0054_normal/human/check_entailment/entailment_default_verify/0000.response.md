Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the program. The function `func_4` is responsible for determining the winner and the first move if the first player wins. However, the program does not handle the case where the input `q` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if `q` is a prime number, the first player should win and print `0` as the first move. 

The function `func_4` returns `(1, 0)` for prime numbers, which indicates that the first player wins and the first move is `0`. However, the program lacks the necessary code to format and print the output as required by the problem description. Specifically, the output should be:

```
1
0
```

But the function only returns a tuple, and there is no code to format and print the output in the required format. This means that the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for handling prime numbers correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect for the case where `q` is a prime number. Hence, the final assessment remains **False**.
