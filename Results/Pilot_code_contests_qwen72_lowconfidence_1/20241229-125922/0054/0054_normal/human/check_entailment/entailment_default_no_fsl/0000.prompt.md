You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You can't possibly imagine how cold our friends are this winter in Nvodsk! Two of them play the following game to warm up: initially a piece of paper has an integer q. During a move a player should write any integer number that is a non-trivial divisor of the last written number. Then he should run this number of circles around the hotel. Let us remind you that a number's divisor is called non-trivial if it is different from one and from the divided number itself. 

The first person who can't make a move wins as he continues to lie in his warm bed under three blankets while the other one keeps running. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally. If the first player wins, print any winning first move.

Input

The first line contains the only integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1013).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Output

In the first line print the number of the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line should contain another integer — his first move (if the first player can't even make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

6


Output

2


Input

30


Output

1
6


Input

1


Output

1
0

Note

Number 6 has only two non-trivial divisors: 2 and 3. It is impossible to make a move after the numbers 2 and 3 are written, so both of them are winning, thus, number 6 is the losing number. A player can make a move and write number 6 after number 30; 6, as we know, is a losing number. Thus, this move will bring us the victory.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\). It returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`. The function correctly identifies prime numbers up to `N` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The returned list `P` contains all integers from 2 to `N` that are prime. Edge cases, such as when `N` is 1 or 2, are handled appropriately: if `N` is 1, the function returns an empty list, and if `N` is 2, it returns a list containing only the number 2.
Function number 2 :
 Code:

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `N` and `block_size`, where `N` is an integer greater than 1 and `block_size` is a positive integer. It returns a non-empty list `primes` that contains all prime numbers up to and including `N`. The function first computes the primes up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N` using a helper function `func_1`. It then extends this list with additional primes found in the range from the square root of `N` to `N` using a segmented sieve approach. Each segment is processed in blocks of size `block_size`. The final list `primes` includes all primes in the specified range, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining the order. Potential edge cases include when `N` is very close to a perfect square, or when `block_size` is large relative to the range being sieved. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring that all necessary blocks are processed and all primes are identified.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(N):
    block_size = 30 * 10 ** 3
    if N <= block_size:
        return func_1(N)
    else:
        return func_2(N, block_size)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13. It processes `N` based on its value relative to a predefined block size of 30,000. If `N` is less than or equal to 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_1(N)`. If `N` is greater than 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_2(N, 30000)`. The function ensures that the appropriate sub-function (`func_1` or `func_2`) is called based on the value of `N`, and the final state of the program is the return value of the chosen sub-function. Edge cases, such as `N` being exactly 30,000, are correctly handled by calling `func_1(N)`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(N):
    NN = N
    P = func_3(int(sqrt(N)))
    D = []
    for p in P:

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13) and returns a tuple. The function attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and processes them to determine the return value based on the following cases:

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
