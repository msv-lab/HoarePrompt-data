Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_4` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not correctly identify the winning player and the first move for certain inputs. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Prime Numbers**: If `N` is a prime number, the function should return `(1, 0)` because the first player cannot make a move. However, the function does not explicitly check if `N` is a prime number and may return incorrect results for prime numbers.

2. **Handling of Perfect Powers**: If `N` is a perfect power (e.g., \( N = p^k \) where \( p \) is a prime and \( k > 1 \)), the function should correctly determine the winning player and the first move. However, the function may not handle these cases correctly, especially if `N` is a large perfect power.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Multiple Divisors**: The function attempts to find up to four divisors and processes them to determine the return value. However, the logic for determining the winning player and the first move is flawed. For example, if `N` has exactly two distinct prime factors, the function returns `(2, 0)`, which is incorrect because the first player can still make a move.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases such as `N = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `N = 1`, the first player wins and should print `0` as the first move. The function correctly handles this case, but it is not clear if it handles other edge cases correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following cases:
- For `N = 7` (a prime number), the function should return `(1, 0)`, but it may return an incorrect result.
- For `N = 9` (a perfect power \( 3^2 \)), the function should return `(1, 3)`, but it may return an incorrect result.
- For `N = 15` (two distinct prime factors), the function should return `(1, 3)`, but it returns `(2, 0)`.

These issues indicate that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
