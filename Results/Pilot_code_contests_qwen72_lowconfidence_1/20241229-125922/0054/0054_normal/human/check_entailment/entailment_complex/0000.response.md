Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle certain edge cases, particularly when the number `N` is a prime number or a power of a prime. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Prime Numbers:**
   - If `N` is a prime number, the function `func_4` will return `(1, 0)` because it cannot find any non-trivial divisors. This is correct according to the problem statement, as a prime number has no non-trivial divisors, and the first player loses immediately.
   
2. **Power of a Prime:**
   - If `N` is a power of a prime (e.g., `N = p^k` where `p` is a prime and `k > 1`), the function `func_4` will only find one non-trivial divisor, which is `p`. However, the function incorrectly returns `(1, 0)` in this case. According to the problem statement, the first player should still lose because the only non-trivial divisor `p` is a winning position for the second player. For example, if `N = 9` (which is `3^2`), the first player can only write `3`, and the second player wins because `3` has no non-trivial divisors.

3. **Numbers with Exactly Two Non-Trivial Divisors:**
   - The function `func_4` correctly identifies that if `N` has exactly two non-trivial divisors, the second player wins. However, it does not handle the case where `N` has more than two non-trivial divisors correctly. For example, if `N = 30` (which has divisors 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15), the function should return `(1, 6)` because the first player can write `6`, and `6` is a losing position for the second player. The function correctly returns `(1, 6)` in this case.

4. **General Case:**
   - The function `func_4` attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and uses the first two to determine the return value. However, it does not handle the case where `N` has more than two non-trivial divisors correctly. For example, if `N = 12` (which has divisors 2, 3, 4, 6), the function should return `(1, 6)` because the first player can write `6`, and `6` is a losing position for the second player. The function correctly returns `(1, 6)` in this case.

However, the issue arises when `N` is a power of a prime, which is not correctly handled. For example, if `N = 8` (which is `2^3`), the function should return `(2, 0)` because the first player can only write `2`, and the second player wins because `2` has no non-trivial divisors. The function incorrectly returns `(1, 0)` in this case.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
