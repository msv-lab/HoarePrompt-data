You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You can't possibly imagine how cold our friends are this winter in Nvodsk! Two of them play the following game to warm up: initially a piece of paper has an integer q. During a move a player should write any integer number that is a non-trivial divisor of the last written number. Then he should run this number of circles around the hotel. Let us remind you that a number's divisor is called non-trivial if it is different from one and from the divided number itself. 

The first person who can't make a move wins as he continues to lie in his warm bed under three blankets while the other one keeps running. Determine which player wins considering that both players play optimally. If the first player wins, print any winning first move.

Input

The first line contains the only integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 1013).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Output

In the first line print the number of the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line should contain another integer — his first move (if the first player can't even make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

6


Output

2


Input

30


Output

1
6


Input

1


Output

1
0

Note

Number 6 has only two non-trivial divisors: 2 and 3. It is impossible to make a move after the numbers 2 and 3 are written, so both of them are winning, thus, number 6 is the losing number. A player can make a move and write number 6 after number 30; 6, as we know, is a losing number. Thus, this move will bring us the victory.

            L = (N - i * i) // i + 1
            primes[i * i:N + 1:i] = [False] * L
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\), `primes` is a list of length `N + 1` where `primes[i]` is `True` if and only if `i` is a prime number, and `primes[0]` and `primes[1]` are `False`.
    P = [n for n, prime in enumerate(primes) if prime]
    return P
    #The program returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`, where `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\). It returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`. The function correctly identifies prime numbers up to `N` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The returned list `P` contains all integers from 2 to `N` that are prime. Edge cases, such as when `N` is 1 or 2, are handled appropriately: if `N` is 1, the function returns an empty list, and if `N` is 2, it returns a list containing only the number 2.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer greater than 1, block_size is a positive integer.

If `r` > 0, `Nb` is incremented by 1.
    for ib in range(Nb):
        block = [True] * block_size
        
        block_beg = SQRT_N + ib * block_size

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. `Nb` is the number of blocks required to cover the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` (inclusive), and `ib` is `Nb - 1`. For each block, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, and `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`. After all iterations, `new_primes` contains all integers in the range `[SQRT_N + 1, N]` that are not divisible by any prime in `primes`.
    primes.extend(new_primes)
    return primes
    #The program returns `primes`, which is a non-empty list containing the original primes from `func_1(SQRT_N)` and all the new primes from `new_primes`. The original primes are those up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, and the new primes are those found in the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` inclusive, specifically the values `n` where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `N` and `block_size`, where `N` is an integer greater than 1 and `block_size` is a positive integer. It returns a non-empty list `primes` that contains all prime numbers up to and including `N`. The function first computes the primes up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N` using a helper function `func_1`. It then extends this list with additional primes found in the range from the square root of `N` to `N` using a segmented sieve approach. Each segment is processed in blocks of size `block_size`. The final list `primes` includes all primes in the specified range, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining the order. Potential edge cases include when `N` is very close to a perfect square, or when `block_size` is large relative to the range being sieved. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring that all necessary blocks are processed and all primes are identified.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13.
def func_3(N):
    block_size = 30 * 10 ** 3
    if (N <= block_size) :
        return func_1(N)
        #The program returns the result of `func_1(N)` where `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13 and is currently less than or equal to 30000.
    else :
        return func_2(N, block_size)
        #The program returns the result of `func_2(N, block_size)`, where `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13 and `N` is greater than `block_size` which is 30000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13. It processes `N` based on its value relative to a predefined block size of 30,000. If `N` is less than or equal to 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_1(N)`. If `N` is greater than 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_2(N, 30000)`. The function ensures that the appropriate sub-function (`func_1` or `func_2`) is called based on the value of `N`, and the final state of the program is the return value of the chosen sub-function. Edge cases, such as `N` being exactly 30,000, are correctly handled by calling `func_1(N)`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13.
def func_4(N):
    NN = N
    P = func_3(int(sqrt(N)))
    D = []
    for p in P:
        d, r = divmod(N, p)
        
        if r == 0:
            D.append(p)
            N = d
        
        if len(D) > 2:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, `NN` is the original `N`, `P` is the iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` contains at most 3 divisors of `N`.
    if (N != NN) :
        D.append(N)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, `NN` is the original `N`, `P` is the iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N`). If `N` is different from `NN`, `D` includes the current value of `N` as one of its divisors. Otherwise, `D` contains at most 3 divisors of `N`.
    if (len(D) == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    else :
        if (len(D) == 2) :
            return 2, 0
            #The program returns the tuple (2, 0)
        else :
            return 1, D[0] * D[1]
            #The program returns 1 and the product of the first two elements in `D`. Since `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N` if `N` is different from `NN`), and the length of `D` is not equal to 2, the product is calculated using the first two elements of `D`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13) and returns a tuple. The function attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and processes them to determine the return value based on the following cases:

I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
