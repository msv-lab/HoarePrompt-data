Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `q` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if `q` is a prime number, the first player should win because a prime number has no non-trivial divisors, and the first player can immediately declare a win by printing `0`. However, the current implementation of `func_4` does not correctly handle this case. Specifically, if `q` is a prime number, the function `func_4` returns `(1, 0)`, which suggests that the first player wins, but it does not print the required output format. The output should be:

```
1
0
```

But the function only returns a tuple, and there is no code to format and print the output as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the case where `q` is a prime number.
