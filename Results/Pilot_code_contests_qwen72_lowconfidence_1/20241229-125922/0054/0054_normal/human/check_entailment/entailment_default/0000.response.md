Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_4` does not handle the case where `N` is a prime number correctly. According to the problem description, if `N` is a prime number, the first player should win immediately because the first player cannot make a move (since there are no non-trivial divisors of a prime number). However, the current implementation of `func_4` does not correctly identify this scenario and does not return the correct output.

For example, consider the input `N = 7`:
- The function `func_4` will attempt to find divisors of 7.
- Since 7 is a prime number, it has no non-trivial divisors.
- The function `func_4` will return `(1, 0)` because `len(D) == 0`.

However, the correct output for `N = 7` should be:
```
1
0
```
This indicates that the first player wins and the first move is 0, which is correct.

But the issue arises when `N` is a composite number with more than two distinct prime factors. For example, consider `N = 30`:
- The function `func_4` will find the divisors 2, 3, and 5.
- It will return `(1, 6)` because `len(D) > 2`.

This is correct according to the problem description, but the issue is that the function does not handle the prime number case correctly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
