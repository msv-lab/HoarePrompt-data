Functionality: ** The function `func_4` takes a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13) and returns a tuple. The function attempts to find up to four divisors of `N` and processes them to determine the return value based on the following cases:

1. **Case_1**: If no divisors are found (i.e., `N` is a prime number), the function returns `(1, 0)`.
2. **Case_2**: If exactly two divisors are found, the function returns `(2, 0)`.
3. **Case_3**: If more than two divisors are found, the function returns `(1, product_of_first_two_elements_in_D)`, where `D` is a list containing the divisors found.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
- If `N` is 1, the function will return `(1, 0)` because 1 has no divisors other than itself.
- If `N` is a perfect square and all divisors are found within the first few iterations, the function will still return `(1, product_of_first_two_elements_in_D)` if more than two divisors are found.
- If `N` is a large prime number, the function will correctly identify it as having no divisors other than itself and return `(1, 0)`.
- If `N` is a composite number with more than two small prime factors, the function will only consider up to four divisors, which might not fully factorize `N`.

After the function concludes, the final state is that `N` is either unchanged (if it is a prime or no divisors were found) or reduced to the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`. The list `D` contains at most four divisors of `N`, and the original value of `N` is stored in `NN`. The function returns a tuple based on the conditions described above. **
