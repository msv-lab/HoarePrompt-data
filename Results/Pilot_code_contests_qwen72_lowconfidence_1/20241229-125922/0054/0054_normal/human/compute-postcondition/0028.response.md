The code appends the current value of `N` to the list `D`. Since `N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, and `D` already contains at most 3 divisors of `N`, appending `N` to `D` updates the content of `D`.

Output State: **`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, `NN` is the original `N`, `P` is the iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N`). The current value of `N` is different from the original `N` (`NN`).**
