The code snippet `beg = p - beg` modifies the value of `beg`. To determine the new value of `beg`, we need to consider the previous value of `beg` and the value of `p`, which is the first element of the `primes` list (`primes[0]`).

Given:
- `beg` is initially `block_beg % primes[0]`.
- `p` is `primes[0]`.

The new value of `beg` is calculated as `p - beg`.

Therefore, the updated value of `beg` is `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`, `beg` is `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])`**
