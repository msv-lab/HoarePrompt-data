The code snippet `block = [True] * block_size` reassigns the variable `block` to a new list of size `block_size` where each element is `True`. This overrides the previous state of `block`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.**
