The code snippet assigns the value of `block_beg % p` to the variable `beg`. To determine the exact value of `beg`, we need to consider the value of `p`. Since `p` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be one of the elements from the `primes` list (as typically, in prime sieving algorithms, `p` represents a prime number).

Given:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is greater than 2
- `ib` is 2
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`

The value of `beg` is calculated as:
- `beg = block_beg % p`

Since `p` is not specified, the value of `beg` depends on the value of `p` chosen from the `primes` list. However, the calculation itself is straightforward: `beg` will be the remainder when `block_beg` is divided by `p`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`, `beg` is `block_beg % p`**
