To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\).
- `NN` = `N`.
- `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
- `D` = [next_p].
- If `r` == 0:
  - `N` is updated to the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`.
  - `D` = [next_p, p].
  - The length of `D` is 2.
- Otherwise:
  - `d` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`.
  - `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`.
  - The length of `D` remains 1.
- If the length of `D` is greater than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for p in P:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the iterable `P`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`p`**: The value of `p` will be the next element in the iterable `P`.
   - **`N`**: Depending on the value of `r` from the previous iteration:
     - If `r` == 0, `N` is updated to the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`.
     - If `r` != 0, `N` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - **`D`**: Depending on the value of `r` from the previous iteration:
     - If `r` == 0, `D` is updated to `[next_p, p]`.
     - If `r` != 0, `D` remains `[next_p]`.
   - **`r`**: The remainder from the division of the original `N` by `p` from the previous iteration.
   - **`d`**: The quotient from the division of the original `N` by `p` from the previous iteration.

### Updated State:
- `N` is updated based on the value of `r` from the previous iteration.
- `p` is the next element in the iterable `P`.
- `D` is updated based on the value of `r` from the previous iteration.
- `r` and `d` are the remainder and quotient from the division of the original `N` by `p` from the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p` if `r` == 0, otherwise `N` remains the same, `p` is the next element in `P`, `D` is `[next_p, p]` if `r` == 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p]`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, `d` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`**.
