The code snippet involves calling a function `func_3` with the argument `int(sqrt(N))`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we can only describe the changes to the variables based on what we know:

- `N` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13.
- `NN` is still equal to `N`.
- `P` is assigned the result of `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.

Without knowing the specifics of `func_3`, we cannot determine the exact value of `P`. However, we can state that `P` now holds the value returned by `func_3` when called with the integer part of the square root of `N`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` = `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`**
