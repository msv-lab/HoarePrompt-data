Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `N` and `block_size`, where `N` is an integer greater than 1 and `block_size` is a positive integer. It returns a non-empty list `primes` that contains all prime numbers up to and including `N`. The function first computes the primes up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N` using a helper function `func_1`. It then extends this list with additional primes found in the range from the square root of `N` to `N` using a segmented sieve approach. Each segment is processed in blocks of size `block_size`. The final list `primes` includes all primes in the specified range, ensuring no duplicates and maintaining the order. Potential edge cases include when `N` is very close to a perfect square, or when `block_size` is large relative to the range being sieved. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring that all necessary blocks are processed and all primes are identified. **
