Postcondition: ***`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, `NN` is the original `N`, `P` is the iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` contains exactly 2 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N` if `N` is different from `NN`). If `N` is different from `NN`, `D` includes the current value of `N` as one of its divisors. Otherwise, `D` contains exactly 2 divisors of `N`. Additionally, `D` is not empty.***
