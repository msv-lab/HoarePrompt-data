To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the effects of the loop on the variables and how these effects accumulate over multiple iterations. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is greater than 2.
   - `ib` is 2.
   - `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each prime `p` in the `primes` list.
   - For each prime `p`:
     - `beg` is calculated as `block_beg % p`.
     - If `beg > 0`, it is adjusted to `p - beg`.
     - `L` is calculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
     - Elements in `block` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, are set to `False`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, the `block` list will have certain elements set to `False` based on the multiples of each prime in `primes`.
   - The `primes` list remains unchanged.
   - `new_primes` will still be a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `block_beg` remains `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
   - `N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `Nb`, and `ib` remain unchanged.

4. **Summary**:
   - The loop marks multiples of each prime in the `primes` list within the `block` list.
   - The final state of `block` will have `False` at positions corresponding to multiples of any prime in `primes`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`.**
