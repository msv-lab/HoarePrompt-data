To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Current State:**
   - `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\).
   - `NN` = `N`.
   - `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
   - `D` = [p].
   - `d` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `p`.
   - `r` is 0.
   - If the length of `D` is greater than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for p in P:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `p` in the iterable `P`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `p` must be available in `P`.
   - The state of `P` remains unchanged between iterations, so it still contains the same elements.
   - The state of `D` must be considered: if the length of `D` exceeds 2, the loop breaks. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `D` must be 1 or 2.
   - The state of `d` and `r` does not affect the loop condition directly, but they might be modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The next element `p` in `P` will be the next value in the iteration.
   - `D` should still be [p] or [p, another_value] to ensure the loop continues.
   - `d` and `r` will be recalculated based on the new `p`.

Given this analysis, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\), `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [next_p], `d` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `next_p`, `r` is 0, and the length of `D` is 1 or 2.**

Here, `next_p` refers to the next element in the iterable `P` that will be used in the next iteration of the loop.
