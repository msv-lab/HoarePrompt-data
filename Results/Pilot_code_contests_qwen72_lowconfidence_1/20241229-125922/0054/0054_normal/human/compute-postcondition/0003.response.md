To determine if the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the variable `P` is iterable and contains at least one element. Let's break down the given information:

- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13.
- `NN` = `N`.
- `P` = `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
- `D` = [].

The key here is the value of `P`. The loop will execute if `P` is an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and contains at least one element. The function `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))` determines the content of `P`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - `NN` is equal to `N`.
   - `P` is the result of `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
   - `D` is an empty list.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `P` is an iterable and contains at least one element.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))` returns an iterable with at least one element.
   - Since `P` is determined by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, we need to ensure that `func_3` returns a non-empty iterable.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `P` must be a non-empty iterable.
   - The initial state should reflect that `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))` returns a non-empty iterable.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = []**
