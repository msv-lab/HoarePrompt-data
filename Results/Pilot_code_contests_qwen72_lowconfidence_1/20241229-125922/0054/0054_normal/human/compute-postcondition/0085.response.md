The code snippet provided appends the value of `n` to the list `new_primes`. Based on the initial state, `n` is set to `block_beg + k` if `block[k]` is true and `n` is less than or equal to `N`. If these conditions are met, `new_primes` will contain `n` after this operation.

Output State: **`block_size` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `block[k]` is true, `n` is set to `block_beg + k`, `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`**.
