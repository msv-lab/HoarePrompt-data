The code snippet `beg = block_beg % p` updates the value of `beg` to the remainder when `block_beg` is divided by `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is greater than 2
- `ib` is 2
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`
- `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list
- `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)` if `beg > 0`
- `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`

After executing the code snippet:
- `beg` is now set to `block_beg % p`

Therefore, the output state is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list, `beg` is `block_beg % p`, `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`**
