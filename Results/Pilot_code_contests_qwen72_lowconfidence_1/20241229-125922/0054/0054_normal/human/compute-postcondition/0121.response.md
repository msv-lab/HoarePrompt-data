The code snippet `new_primes.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `new_primes`. Given that `n` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1`, this value is appended to `new_primes`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. Additionally, `new_primes` now contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`.
- `k` is 1.
- `n` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, and `new_primes` now contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`, `k` is 1, `n` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1`.**
