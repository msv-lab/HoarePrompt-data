The value of `block_beg` is updated to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`. Given that `ib` is 2, the new value of `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.**
