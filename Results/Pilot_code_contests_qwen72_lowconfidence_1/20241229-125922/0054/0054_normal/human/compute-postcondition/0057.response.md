The code snippet `block[beg:block_size:p] = [False] * L` updates the `block` list by setting certain elements to `False`. Let's break down the impact:

- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, initially all `True`.
- `beg` is calculated based on `primes[0]` and `block_beg`.
- `p` is the first element of the `primes` list (`primes[0]`).
- `L` is calculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

The slice `block[beg:block_size:p]` is set to `[False] * L`, which means starting from index `beg`, every `p`-th element up to `block_size` is set to `False`.

### Updated Values:
- `block` is modified such that elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)p` are set to `False`.

### Unchanged Values:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `beg` is updated to `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[0]`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

### Output State:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `beg` is updated to `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[0]`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)p` are set to `False`.**
