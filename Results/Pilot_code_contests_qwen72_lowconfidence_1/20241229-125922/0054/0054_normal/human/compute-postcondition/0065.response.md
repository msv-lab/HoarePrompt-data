The code snippet `beg = block_beg % p` updates the value of `beg` to the remainder when `block_beg` is divided by `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`.
- If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `beg` is now `block_beg % p`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`, `beg` is `block_beg % p`.**
