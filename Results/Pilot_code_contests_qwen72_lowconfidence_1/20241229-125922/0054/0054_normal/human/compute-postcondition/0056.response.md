To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet:

```python
L = (block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1
```

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.
- `beg` is updated to `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[0]`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `p` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be assumed that `p` is a variable that is part of the context or a predefined value. For this analysis, we will assume `p` is a positive integer.
- The expression `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1` calculates the value of `L`.

### Calculation:
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `beg` is a value derived from `block_beg` and `primes[0]`.
- `p` is a positive integer.

Let's break down the expression:
1. `block_size - 1 - beg` computes a value that depends on `block_size` and `beg`.
2. The result of `block_size - 1 - beg` is divided by `p` using integer division (`//`).
3. 1 is added to the result of the division.

### Output State:
- `L` is assigned the value of `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`, `beg` is updated to `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[0]`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.**
