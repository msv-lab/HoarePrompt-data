The code snippet `beg = p - beg` modifies the value of `beg`. Given that `beg` was initially defined as `block_beg % p` and is greater than 0, the new value of `beg` is calculated as `p - (block_beg % p)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is greater than 2
- `ib` is 2
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`
- `beg` is `p - (block_beg % p)`

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`, `beg` is `p - (block_beg % p)`**
