To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial states:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for k in range(block_size):` will execute if `block_size` is greater than 0. This is because `range(block_size)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `block_size - 1`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is greater than 2.
   - `ib` is 2.
   - `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `block_size` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `k` should start at 0.

Given these conditions, the state needs to ensure that `block_size` is positive and `k` is initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`, `k` is 0**.
