To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the provided state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for p in primes:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Prerequisites for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `primes` is a non-empty list.
   - The variable `p` will take each value from the `primes` list in sequence.

2. **Given State Verification**:
   - `primes` is already specified as a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `primes` is already non-empty, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given state.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `primes` is a non-empty list, which is already guaranteed by the given state. Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`**.
