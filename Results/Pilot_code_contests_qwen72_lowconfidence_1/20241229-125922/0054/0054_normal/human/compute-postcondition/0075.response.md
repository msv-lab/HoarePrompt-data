The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `new_primes`. The value of `n` is defined as `block_beg + k`, and it is confirmed that `n` is less than or equal to `N`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`block_size` is at least 1, `block[k]` is true, `n` is `block_beg + k`, `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`**
