The code `new_primes.append(n)` adds the current value of `n` to the list `new_primes`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list that may contain the single element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k` if `n <= N`).
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 0.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.
- `k` is `k_prev + 1` and `k < block_size`.
- `n` is `SQRT_N + k`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `new_primes` now contains the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`).

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list that contains the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`), `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 0, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`, `k` is `k_prev + 1` and `k < block_size`, `n` is `SQRT_N + k`.**
