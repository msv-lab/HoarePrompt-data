Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. `Nb` is the number of blocks required to cover the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` (inclusive), and `ib` is `Nb - 1`. For each block, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, and `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`. After all iterations, `new_primes` contains all integers in the range `[SQRT_N + 1, N]` that are not divisible by any prime in `primes`.**
