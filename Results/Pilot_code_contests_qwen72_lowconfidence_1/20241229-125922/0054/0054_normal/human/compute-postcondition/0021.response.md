The code appends the value of `p` to the list `D`. Given the initial state, `D` is either `[next_p, p]` if `r` was 0, or `[next_p]` if `r` was not 0. After appending `p` to `D`, the new value of `D` will be:

- If `r` was 0: `D` becomes `[next_p, p, p]`.
- If `r` was not 0: `D` becomes `[next_p, p]`.

The values of `N`, `p`, `r`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p` if `r` == 0, otherwise `N` remains the same, `p` is the next element in `P`, `D` is `[next_p, p, p]` if `r` == 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p, p]`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`**
