The code snippet updates the value of `L` based on the current values of `block_size`, `beg`, and `p` (which is `primes[1]` from the initial state). Let's break down the changes:

- `L` is recalculated using the formula `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.
- If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `L` is now `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`, if `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.**
