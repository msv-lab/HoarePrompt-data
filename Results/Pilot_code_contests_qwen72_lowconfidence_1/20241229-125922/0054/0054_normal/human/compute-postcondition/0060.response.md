The code snippet `beg = p - beg` updates the value of `beg` by subtracting the current value of `beg` from `p`. To determine the new value of `beg`, we need to consider the previous value of `beg` and the value of `p`.

From the initial state:
- `p` is the second element of the `primes` list (`primes[1]`).
- `beg` is initially calculated as `block_beg % primes[1]`.

Let's calculate the new value of `beg`:

1. **Initial Value of `beg`:**
   - `beg = block_beg % primes[1]`

2. **New Value of `beg`:**
   - `beg = p - beg`
   - Substituting the initial value of `beg`:
   - `beg = primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`

The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `beg` is `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.**
