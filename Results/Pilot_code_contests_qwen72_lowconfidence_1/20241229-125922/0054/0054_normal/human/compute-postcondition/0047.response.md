To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the initial conditions step by step.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is an empty list.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 0.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for k in range(block_size):
    if block[k]:
        n = block_beg + k
        if n <= N:
            new_primes.append(n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `0` to `block_size - 1`.
   - For each `k` in this range, it checks if `block[k]` is `True`.
   - If `block[k]` is `True`, it calculates `n = block_beg + k`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `N`, it appends `n` to `new_primes`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `k` will have iterated through all values from `0` to `block_size - 1`.
   - The variable `new_primes` will contain all values of `n` (where `n = block_beg + k`) such that `block[k]` is `True` and `n <= N`.

### Output State:
- `N` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` remains a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` remains a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` remains at least 1.
- `ib` remains 0.
- `block_beg` remains equal to `SQRT_N`.
- `block` remains a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 0, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.**
