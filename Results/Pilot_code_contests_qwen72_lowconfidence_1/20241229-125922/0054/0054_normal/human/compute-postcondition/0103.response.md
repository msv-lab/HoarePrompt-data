The provided code snippet updates the value of `L` based on the existing values of `block_size`, `beg`, and `p`. The calculation for `L` is given by:

\[ L = \left( \text{block_size} - 1 - \text{beg} \right) // p + 1 \]

Given the initial state, let's determine the new value of `L`:

- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `beg` is an index that might have been updated previously, but its exact value is not specified. However, if `beg` was updated, it would be `p - (block_beg % p)`.
- `p` is a variable that is part of the context, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `beg` and `p` are not specified, we can only express `L` in terms of these variables. The other variables (`N`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `ib`, `block_beg`, `block`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`. If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.**
