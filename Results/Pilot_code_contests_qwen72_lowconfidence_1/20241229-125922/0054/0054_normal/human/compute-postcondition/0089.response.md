To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the loop condition:

### Current State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for ib in range(Nb):` will continue as long as `ib` is less than `Nb`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `ib`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `ib` is 1.
2. **Next Value of `ib`:** In the next iteration, `ib` will be incremented by 1, so `ib` will be 2.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop will execute again if `ib` is less than `Nb`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ib` must be incremented to 2.
- For the loop to execute again, `Nb` must be greater than 2.

### Updated State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` must be greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.**
