The code snippet initializes the `block` variable as a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.

- `N` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` remains a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` remains a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` remains a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` must remain greater than 2.
- `ib` remains 2.
- `block_beg` remains equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `block` is now a list of `block_size` elements, all initialized to `True`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.**
