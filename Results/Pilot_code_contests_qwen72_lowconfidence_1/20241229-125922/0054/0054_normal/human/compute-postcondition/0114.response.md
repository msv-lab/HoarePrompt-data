The code assigns the value of `block_beg + k` to the variable `n`. Given that `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size` and `k` is 0, the value of `n` becomes `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 0`.

Therefore, the updated value of `n` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`, `k` is 0, `n` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, and the element at index `k` in `block` is `True`.**
