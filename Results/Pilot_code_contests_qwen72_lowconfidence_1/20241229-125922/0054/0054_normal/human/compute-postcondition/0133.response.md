The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `N` and `block_size`. `N` is an integer greater than 1, and `block_size` is a positive integer. The function returns a non-empty list `primes` containing the original primes up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, and all new primes found in the range from the square root of `N` to `N` inclusive, where each new prime `n` is calculated as `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`.
