The code `D.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `D`. The value of `p` is derived from the non-empty iterable `P` returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [p], `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`, and the current value of `r` is 0**
