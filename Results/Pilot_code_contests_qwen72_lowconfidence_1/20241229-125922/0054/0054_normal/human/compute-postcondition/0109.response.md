The code snippet `L = (block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1` calculates the number of multiples of `p` within the current block, starting from the index `beg` to the end of the block.

- `block_size` is a positive integer representing the size of the block.
- `beg` is the starting index within the block where marking multiples of `p` begins.
- `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list.

Given the initial state, the calculation for `L` is:

\[ L = \left( \text{block_size} - 1 - \text{beg} \right) // p + 1 \]

This formula determines the number of steps required to mark all multiples of `p` within the block, starting from `beg`.

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list, `beg` is updated to `block_beg % p` or `p - (block_beg % p)` depending on the condition, `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`**
