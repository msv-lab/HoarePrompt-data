The code snippet assigns the value of `block_beg + k` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state:

- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list that may contain the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`) if `n <= N` and `block[k]` is `True`
- `Nb` is at least 1
- `ib` is 0
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`
- `k` is `k + 1` and `k < block_size`

After executing the code snippet `n = block_beg + k`, the value of `n` is updated to `SQRT_N + k`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list that may contain the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`) if `n <= N` and `block[k]` is `True`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 0, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k < block_size`, `n` is `SQRT_N + k`**
