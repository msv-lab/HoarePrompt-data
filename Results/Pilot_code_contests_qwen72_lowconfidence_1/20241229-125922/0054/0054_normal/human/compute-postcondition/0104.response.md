The code snippet `block[beg:block_size:p] = [False] * L` updates a slice of the `block` list starting from index `beg` up to but not including `block_size`, stepping by `p`, setting each element in this range to `False`. The length of this slice is determined by `L`.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `block`: This list is modified. Specifically, the elements from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, are set to `False`.
- `beg`, `block_size`, and `p` determine the indices that are affected.
- `L` is used to determine the number of elements to set to `False`.

Given the initial state, the variables `N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `ib`, and `block_beg` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `block` list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, are set to `False`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`. If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.**
