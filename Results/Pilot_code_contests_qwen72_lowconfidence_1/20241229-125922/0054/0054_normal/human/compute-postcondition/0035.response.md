Postcondition: ***`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by the divisors found in `D`, `NN` is the original `N`, `P` is the iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` contains at most 4 divisors of `N` (including the current value of `N`). If `N` is different from `NN`, `D` includes the current value of `N` as one of its divisors. Otherwise, `D` contains at most 3 divisors of `N`. Additionally, `D` is not empty. The length of `D` is not equal to 2.***
