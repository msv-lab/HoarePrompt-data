To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can proceed to the next iteration. The loop iterates over the list `primes`, and the key variable here is `p`.

### Current State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `beg` is updated to `primes[0] - (block_beg % primes[0])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[0]`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)p` are set to `False`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- The list `primes` must have at least one more element.
- The variable `p` should be the next element in the `primes` list.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `p` should be updated to the next element in the `primes` list.
- The value of `L` and the modifications to the `block` list will depend on the new value of `p`.

### Updated State:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[1]`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[1]`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`**.
