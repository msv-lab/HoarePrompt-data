You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 1:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer 2:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on the variables over multiple iterations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each prime `p` in the `primes` list.
   - For each prime `p`:
     - `beg` is calculated as `block_beg % p`.
     - If `beg > 0`, it is updated to `p - beg`.
     - `L` is calculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
     - Elements in `block` from index `beg` to `block_size` in steps of `p` are set to `False`.

3. **Effect of Multiple Iterations:**
   - After each iteration, the `block` list will have more elements set to `False` based on the current prime `p`.
   - The `beg` value is recalculated for each prime `p`, and the elements at the specified indices are set to `False`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations of the loop, the `block` list will have elements set to `False` at indices that are multiples of any prime in the `primes` list, starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime.
   - The `block` list will still have `block_size` elements, but many of them will be `False`.

5. **Summary:**
   - `N` remains an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` remains a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` remains a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` remains a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` remains at least 1.
   - `ib` remains 1.
   - `block_beg` remains equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.**
```
for k in range(block_size):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
