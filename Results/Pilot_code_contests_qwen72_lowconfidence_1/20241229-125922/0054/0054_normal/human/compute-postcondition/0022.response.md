`N` is updated to the value of `d`. Since `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `N` now holds this quotient value. The value of `p` remains the next element in `P`, `D` is `[next_p, p, p]` if `r` was 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p, p]`, and `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`.

Output State: **`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p` if `r` == 0, otherwise `N` remains the same, `p` is the next element in `P`, `D` is `[next_p, p, p]` if `r` == 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p, p]`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`**
