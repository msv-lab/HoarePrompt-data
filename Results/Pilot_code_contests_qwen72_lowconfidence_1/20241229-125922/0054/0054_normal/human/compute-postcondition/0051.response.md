To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the elements in the `primes` list. Therefore, the loop will execute if `primes` is not empty.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is at least 1
- `ib` is 1
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`

The key condition for the loop to execute is that `primes` must be a non-empty list. Since `primes` is already specified as a non-empty list, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.**
