To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to continue:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for k in range(block_size):` will continue as long as `k` is within the range of `0` to `block_size - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list that may contain the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`) if `n <= N` and `block[k]` is `True`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 0.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.
   - `k` is `k_prev + 1` and `k < block_size`. If `block[k]` is `True`, `n` is added to the `new_primes` list, otherwise `new_primes` remains unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `k` must still be within the range of `0` to `block_size - 1`.

Given the current state:
- `k` is `k_prev + 1` and `k < block_size`.

For the next iteration:
- `k` will be `k + 1`.
- The new value of `k` must satisfy `k < block_size`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `k` is `k + 1`.
- All other variables (`N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `ib`, `block_beg`, `block`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the loop body.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list that may contain the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`) if `n <= N` and `block[k]` is `True`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 0, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k < block_size`. If `block[k]` is `True`, `n` is added to the `new_primes` list, otherwise `new_primes` remains unchanged.**
