The given code snippet updates the `block` list by setting certain elements to `False` based on the specified slicing operation. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact:

1. **Slicing Operation**: The slicing `block[beg:block_size:p]` selects elements from the `block` list starting from index `beg` up to (but not including) `block_size` with a step size of `p`. These selected elements are set to `False`.

2. **Length Calculation**: The length `L` of the slice is calculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`. This ensures that the number of elements being set to `False` is correctly determined.

3. **Update `block`**: The elements in the `block` list at the positions specified by the slice are set to `False`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 1.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.
- If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The elements in the `block` list at positions `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`, and elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`. If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.**
