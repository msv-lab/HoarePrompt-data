The code snippet `beg = block_beg % p` updates the value of `beg` based on the modulo operation between `block_beg` and `p`. Since `p` is not explicitly defined in the given code, it is assumed to be the same as `primes[1]` from the initial state. Hereâ€™s the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])` if `beg` > 0, otherwise `beg` remains as `block_beg % primes[1]`.
   - `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `beg = block_beg % p` updates `beg` to the remainder of `block_beg` divided by `p`.
   - Since `p` is `primes[1]`, the new value of `beg` is `block_beg % primes[1]`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `beg` is now `block_beg % primes[1]`.
   - `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `beg` is `block_beg % primes[1]`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`**.
