The value of `n` is updated to `block_beg + k`. Since the initial state indicates that `k` is incremented by 1, and if `block[k]` is true, `n` is set to `block_beg + k`, this line of code confirms the setting of `n` under the condition that `block[k]` is true. If `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`block_size` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, if `block[k]` is true, `n` is `block_beg + k`, if `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`, if `block[k]` is false, the state remains unchanged.**
