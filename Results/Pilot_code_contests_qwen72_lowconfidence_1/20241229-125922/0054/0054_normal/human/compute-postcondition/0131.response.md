The code snippet `primes.extend(new_primes)` appends all elements from the list `new_primes` to the end of the list `primes`. This operation modifies the `primes` list by adding the new primes found in the `new_primes` list.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list containing the original primes from `func_1(SQRT_N)` and all the new primes from `new_primes`
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is the number of blocks required to cover the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` (inclusive)
- `ib` is `Nb - 1`
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`
