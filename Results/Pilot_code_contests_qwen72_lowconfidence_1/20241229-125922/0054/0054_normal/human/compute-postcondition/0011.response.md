Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [p], `d` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `p`, `r` is 0. If the length of `D` is greater than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
