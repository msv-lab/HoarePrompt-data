To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect the conditions necessary for the loop to run at least once. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each index `k` in the range from 0 to `block_size - 1`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `block_size` is at least 1. This is because the range function `range(block_size)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `block_size - 1`, and if `block_size` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `block_size` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer (at least 1), `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.**
