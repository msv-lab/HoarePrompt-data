The code snippet `D.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `D`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\).
- `NN` = `N`.
- `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
- `D` = [next_p].
- `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`.
- `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`.
- The length of `D` is 1 or 2.

After executing `D.append(p)`, the value of `p` is appended to the list `D`, making `D` a list with two elements: `[next_p, p]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\), `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [next_p, p], `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`, and the length of `D` is 2.**
