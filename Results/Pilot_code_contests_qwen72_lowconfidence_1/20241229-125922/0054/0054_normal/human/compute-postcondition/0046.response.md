Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list that may contain the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k`) if `n <= N` and `block[k]` is `True`. `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 0, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k < block_size`. If `block[k]` is `True`, `new_primes` contains the element `n` (where `n = SQRT_N + k` and `n <= N`). If `block[k]` is `False`, `new_primes` remains unchanged.***
