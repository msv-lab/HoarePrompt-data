The code snippet `d, r = divmod(N, p)` divides `N` by `p` and assigns the quotient to `d` and the remainder to `r`. Here, `p` is an element from the iterable `P`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13
- `NN` = `N`
- `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`
- `D` = []

The values of `d` and `r` depend on the specific value of `p` taken from the iterable `P`.

Since `p` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `r`. However, we know that `d` will be the integer division of `N` by `p`, and `r` will be the remainder of this division.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13
- `NN` = `N`
- `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`
- `D` = []
- `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`
- `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [], `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`**
