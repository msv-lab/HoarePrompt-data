The given code snippet `d, r = divmod(N, p)` performs division and modulus operations, updating the values of `d` and `r` based on the division of `N` by `p`.

- `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\).
- `p` is an element from the iterable `P`, which is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`.
- `d` is updated to the quotient of `N` divided by `p`.
- `r` is updated to the remainder of `N` divided by `p`.

The other variables (`NN`, `P`, `D`, and the initial value of `d`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\), `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [next_p], `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`, and the length of `D` is 1 or 2.**
