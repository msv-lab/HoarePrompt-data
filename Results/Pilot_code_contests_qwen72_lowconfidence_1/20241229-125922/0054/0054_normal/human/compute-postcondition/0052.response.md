`beg` is assigned the value of `block_beg % p`. Here, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, and `p` is the first element of `primes` (since `primes` is a non-empty list). The values of `N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `ib`, and `block` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`, `beg` is `block_beg % primes[0]`.
