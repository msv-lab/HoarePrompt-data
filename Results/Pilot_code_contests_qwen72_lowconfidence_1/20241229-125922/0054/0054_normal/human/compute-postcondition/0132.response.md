Output State: **The program returns `primes`, which is a non-empty list containing the original primes from `func_1(SQRT_N)` and all the new primes from `new_primes`. The original primes are those up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, and the new primes are those found in the range from `SQRT_N` to `N` inclusive, specifically the values `n` where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`.**
