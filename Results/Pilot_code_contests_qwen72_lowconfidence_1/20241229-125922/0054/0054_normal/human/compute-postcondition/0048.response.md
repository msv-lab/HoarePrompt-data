To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is at least 1.
- `ib` is 0.
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for ib in range(Nb):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `ib` is less than `Nb`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `ib` is 0.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, the loop condition `ib < Nb` is true, and the loop will execute at least once more.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - After the current iteration, `ib` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `ib` will be 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `ib` is still less than `Nb`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `ib` is 1.
- All other variables (`N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `block_beg`, `block`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop increment.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where for each prime `p` in `primes`, elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2p`, ..., up to the last index that does not exceed `block_size - 1` are set to `False`.**
