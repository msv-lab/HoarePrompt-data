Postcondition: ***`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p` if `r` == 0, otherwise `N` remains the same. `p` is the next element in `P`. `D` is `[next_p, p, p]` if `r` == 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p, p]`. `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`. `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`. `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`.***
