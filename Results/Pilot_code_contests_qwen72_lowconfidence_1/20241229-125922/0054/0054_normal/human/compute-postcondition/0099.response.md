To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the state and the loop conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the `primes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the `primes` list to process.

2. **Current State**:
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is greater than 2.
   - `ib` is 2.
   - `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`.
   - `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more element in the `primes` list to process.
   - Since `primes` is a non-empty list, we need to check if there is at least one more prime number left to process.

Given the current state, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the current prime `p` being processed. The loop will move to the next prime in the `primes` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the next prime in the `primes` list is being processed. The other variables remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`, and `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`. The next prime `p` in the `primes` list is being processed.**
