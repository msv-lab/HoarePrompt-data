Let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
L = (block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `block_size`: A positive integer.
   - `beg`: This variable is updated based on the condition `beg` > 0. If `beg` > 0, it is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.
   - `p`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the calculation. We assume it is a positive integer.
   
2. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - The expression `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1` is evaluated to compute the value of `L`.
   - `block_size - 1` is a positive integer since `block_size` is positive.
   - Subtracting `beg` from `block_size - 1` results in a value that depends on the value of `beg`.
   - The result of the subtraction is then integer divided by `p`.
   - Finally, 1 is added to the result of the division.

3. **Update the Variables:**
   - The variable `L` is updated with the result of the expression.

### Initial State Recap:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`.
- If `beg` > 0, `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.

### Updated State:
- `L` is computed as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, all set to `True`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.**
