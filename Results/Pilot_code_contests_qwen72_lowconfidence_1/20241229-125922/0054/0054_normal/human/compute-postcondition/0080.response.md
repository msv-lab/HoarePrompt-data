The code snippet `new_primes.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `new_primes`. Given the initial state:

- `block_size` is at least 1
- `k` is incremented by 1
- If `block[k]` is true, `n` is `block_beg + k`
- If `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`
- If `block[k]` is false, the state remains unchanged

The impact of the code snippet is that `n` is added to the list `new_primes`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`block_size` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, if `block[k]` is true, `n` is `block_beg + k`, if `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`, `new_primes` now includes `n`**.
