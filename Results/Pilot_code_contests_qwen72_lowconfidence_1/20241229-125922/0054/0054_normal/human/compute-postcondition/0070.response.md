To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on the variables over multiple iterations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each prime `p` in the `primes` list.
   - For each prime `p`:
     - `beg` is calculated as `block_beg % p`.
     - If `beg > 0`, it is updated to `p - beg`.
     - `L` is calculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
     - Elements in `block` from index `beg` to `block_size` in steps of `p` are set to `False`.

3. **Effect of Multiple Iterations:**
   - After each iteration, the `block` list will have more elements set to `False` based on the current prime `p`.
   - The `beg` value is recalculated for each prime `p`, and the elements at the specified indices are set to `False`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After all iterations of the loop, the `block` list will have elements set to `False` at indices that are multiples of any prime in the `primes` list, starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime.
   - The `block` list will still have `block_size` elements, but many of them will be `False`.

5. **Summary:**
   - `N` remains an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` remains a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` remains a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` remains a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` remains at least 1.
   - `ib` remains 1.
   - `block_beg` remains equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.**
