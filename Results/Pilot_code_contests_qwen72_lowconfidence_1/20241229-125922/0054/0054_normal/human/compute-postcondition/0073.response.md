The value of `n` is assigned the sum of `block_beg` and `k`. The initial state indicates that `block_size` is at least 1 and `block[k]` is true (non-zero or non-false), ensuring the loop can execute. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `block_beg` and `k`, we will represent `n` as the expression `block_beg + k`.

Output State: **`block_size` is at least 1, `block[k]` is true, `n` is `block_beg + k`**
