The code snippet `block_beg = SQRT_N + ib * block_size` updates the value of `block_beg` by setting it to the sum of `SQRT_N` and the product of `ib` and `block_size`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1
- `block_size` is a positive integer
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`)
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`
- `Nb` is at least 1
- `ib` is 1
- `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N`
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `block_beg` is updated to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where each element is `True`.**
