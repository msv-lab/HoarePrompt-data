The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since the initial state specifies conditions related to `N`, `NN`, `P`, `D`, `r`, `d`, and `p`, and the `break` statement does not alter these variables directly, their values remain unchanged. However, the control flow of the program changes, and we note that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\), `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [next_p]. If `r` == 0, `N` is updated to the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`, `D` = [next_p, p], and the length of `D` is 2. Otherwise, `d` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, and the length of `D` remains 1. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
