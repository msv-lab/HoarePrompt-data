To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. If `k` is 1 and `block[1]` is `True`, `new_primes` now contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1` provided that this value is less than or equal to `N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in range(block_size):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `k` from 0 to `block_size - 1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range `0` to `block_size - 1`.

### State Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `k` was 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2.
- The other variables (`N`, `block_size`, `SQRT_N`, `primes`, `new_primes`, `Nb`, `ib`, `block_beg`, and `block`) remain unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `k` is incremented to 2.
- All other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. If `k` is 1 and `block[1]` is `True`, `new_primes` now contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size + 1` provided that this value is less than or equal to `N`. `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`, and `k` is 2.**
