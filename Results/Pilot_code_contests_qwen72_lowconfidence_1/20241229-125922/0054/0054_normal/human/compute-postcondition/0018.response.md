Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^{13}\), `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [next_p]. If `r` == 0, `N` is updated to the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`, `D` = [next_p, p], and the length of `D` is 2. Otherwise, `d` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, and the length of `D` remains 1. If the length of `D` is greater than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.***
