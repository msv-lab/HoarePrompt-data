The line of code `beg = p - beg` updates the value of `beg`. To determine the new value of `beg`, we need to consider its initial value and the value of `p`.

- `beg` was initially defined as `block_beg % p`.
- The new value of `beg` is calculated as `p - beg`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- `beg` is `block_beg % p`.

After executing `beg = p - beg`:
- The new value of `beg` is `p - (block_beg % p)`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- `beg` is `p - (block_beg % p)`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements, where every `p`-th element from index `beg` to `block_size - 1` is set to `False`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`, `beg` is `p - (block_beg % p)`**.
