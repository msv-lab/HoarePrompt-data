`d` and `r` are updated using the `divmod` function, which returns the quotient and remainder of `N` divided by `p`. The value of `N` remains unchanged. The value of `p` also remains unchanged. The list `D` and the previous value of `d` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is the quotient of the original `N` divided by `p` if `r` == 0, otherwise `N` remains the same, `p` is the next element in `P`, `D` is `[next_p, p]` if `r` == 0, otherwise `D` is `[next_p]`, `r` is the remainder of the original `N` divided by `p`, `d` is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`, `r` is the remainder of `N` divided by `p`**
