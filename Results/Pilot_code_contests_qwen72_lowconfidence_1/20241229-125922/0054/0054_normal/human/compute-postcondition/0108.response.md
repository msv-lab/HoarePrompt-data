Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list, `beg` is updated to `block_beg % p`. If `beg` > 0, `beg` is further updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`, and `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % p` and `block` is not updated.***
