The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13. The function has three possible return cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the tuple `(2, 0)`.
- **Case_3**: The function returns a tuple where the first element is `1` and the second element is the product of the first two elements in `D`. Here, `D` is a list containing at most 4 divisors of `N` (including `N` itself if `N` is different from `NN`), and the length of `D` is not equal to 2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a positive integer `N` and return a specific tuple based on the conditions described above.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `N` and returns a tuple. In Case_1, it returns `(1, 0)`. In Case_2, it returns `(2, 0)`. In Case_3, it returns a tuple `(1, product_of_first_two_elements_in_D)` where `D` is a list containing at most 4 divisors of `N` and the length of `D` is not equal to 2.**
