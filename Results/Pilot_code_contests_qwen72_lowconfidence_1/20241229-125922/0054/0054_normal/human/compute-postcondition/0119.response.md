According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the `block_size`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `block_size`, and `k` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. If the element at index `k` in `block` is `True`, `new_primes` now also contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`.
- `k` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop condition (`k < block_size`) must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`. If the element at index `k` in `block` is `True`, `new_primes` now also contains the value `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`. `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` starting from `beg` are set to `False`, `k` is 1.**
