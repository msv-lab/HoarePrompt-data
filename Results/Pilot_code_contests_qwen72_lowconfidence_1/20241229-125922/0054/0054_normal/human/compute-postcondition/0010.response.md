The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13, `NN` = `N`, `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(N)))`, `D` = [p], `d` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `p`, `r` is 0, the length of `D` is greater than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
