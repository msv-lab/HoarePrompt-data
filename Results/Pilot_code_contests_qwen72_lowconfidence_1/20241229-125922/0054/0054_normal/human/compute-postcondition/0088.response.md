Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime) are set to `False`.** 

After the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `block` will have `False` at indices that are multiples of any prime in `primes` (starting from the calculated `beg` value for each prime).
- `new_primes` will contain all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `k` will have iterated from 0 to `block_size - 1`.
- If `block_size` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `new_primes` will remain unchanged.
