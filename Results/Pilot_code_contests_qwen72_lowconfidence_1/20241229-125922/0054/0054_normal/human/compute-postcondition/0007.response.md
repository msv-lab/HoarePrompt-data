The value of `N` is updated to be equal to `d`, which is the quotient of `N` divided by `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `p`, `NN` = `N` (original), `P` is a non-empty iterable returned by `func_3(int(sqrt(NN)))`, `D` = [p], `d` is the quotient of `NN` divided by `p`, `r` is 0**
