To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can proceed. The loop iterates over the `primes` list, and each iteration processes a prime number `p`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State:**
   - `N` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `block_size` is a positive integer.
   - `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
   - `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
   - `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
   - `Nb` is at least 1.
   - `ib` is 1.
   - `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`.
   - `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // primes[1] + 1`.
   - `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + primes[1]`, `beg + 2*primes[1]`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*primes[1]` are set to `False`, and elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`.
   - If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `primes` list to process.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `p` will be updated to the next element in the `primes` list.
   - The variable `L` will be recalculated based on the new value of `p`.
   - The `block` list will be modified according to the new value of `p`.

### Updated State:

- `p` is now the next prime in the `primes` list.
- `L` is recalculated as `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- Elements in `block` at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is at least 1, `ib` is 1, `block_beg` is equal to `SQRT_N + ib * block_size`, `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`, `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`, and elements at indices `beg`, `beg + p`, `beg + 2*p`, ..., `beg + (L-1)*p` are set to `False`. If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `primes[1] - (block_beg % primes[1])`. Otherwise, `beg` remains `block_beg % primes[1]`.**
