According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `block_size`. The loop iterates over the range of `block_size`, and `k` is incremented by 1 at each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was some value within the range of `block_size`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `block_size` is at least 1.
- If `block[k]` is true, `n` is set to `block_beg + k`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`.
- If `block[k]` is false, the state remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` must be incremented by 1.
- `k` must still be less than `block_size` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `k` is incremented by 1.
- `block_size` remains the same (at least 1).
- The conditions for `n` and `new_primes` depend on the new value of `k` and the state of `block[k]`.

State: **`block_size` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, if `block[k]` is true, `n` is set to `block_beg + k`, if `n` is less than or equal to `N`, `new_primes` contains `n`, if `block[k]` is false, the state remains unchanged.**
