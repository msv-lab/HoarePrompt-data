To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` is a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` is greater than 2.
- `ib` is 2.
- `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `block` is a list of `block_size` elements where elements from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, are set to `False`.
- `L` is `(block_size - 1 - beg) // p + 1`.
- If `beg > 0`, `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for p in primes:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `primes` list.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `primes`: This is the list being iterated over.
   - `p`: The current prime number being processed in the loop.
   - `block`: A list of `block_size` elements.
   - `block_beg`: The starting value for the block.
   - `beg`: The starting index for marking multiples of `p` in the block.
   - `L`: The number of steps to mark multiples of `p` in the block.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`p`**: The value of `p` will change to the next element in the `primes` list.
- **`beg`**: If `beg > 0`, it needs to be updated to `p - (block_beg % p)`.
- **`block`**: Elements in the `block` list from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`, will be set to `False`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Update `p`**: Move to the next prime in the `primes` list.
2. **Update `beg`**: If `beg > 0`, update it to `p - (block_beg % p)`.
3. **Update `block`**: Mark the multiples of `p` in the `block` list.

### Final State:
Given the above adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `N` remains an integer greater than 1.
- `block_size` remains a positive integer.
- `SQRT_N` remains the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`.
- `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`).
- `new_primes` remains a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`.
- `Nb` remains greater than 2.
- `ib` remains 2.
- `block_beg` remains `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`.
- `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list.
- `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)` if `beg > 0`.
- `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `block_size` is a positive integer, `SQRT_N` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `N`, `primes` is a non-empty list (result of `func_1(SQRT_N)`), `new_primes` is a list containing all values `n` (where `n = block_beg + k` and `block[k]` is `True`) such that `n <= N`, `Nb` is greater than 2, `ib` is 2, `block_beg` is `SQRT_N + 2 * block_size`, `p` is the next prime in the `primes` list, `beg` is updated to `p - (block_beg % p)` if `beg > 0`, `block` is updated to mark multiples of `p` from index `beg` to `block_size - 1`, stepping by `p`**.
