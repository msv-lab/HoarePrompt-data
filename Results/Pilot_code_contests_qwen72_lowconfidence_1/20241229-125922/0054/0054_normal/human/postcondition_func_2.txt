The function `func_3` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^13. It processes `N` based on its value relative to a predefined block size of 30,000. If `N` is less than or equal to 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_1(N)`. If `N` is greater than 30,000, the function returns the result of `func_2(N, 30000)`. The function ensures that the appropriate sub-function (`func_1` or `func_2`) is called based on the value of `N`, and the final state of the program is the return value of the chosen sub-function. Edge cases, such as `N` being exactly 30,000, are correctly handled by calling `func_1(N)`.
