The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\). It returns a list `P` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `N`. The function correctly identifies prime numbers up to `N` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The returned list `P` contains all integers from 2 to `N` that are prime. Edge cases, such as when `N` is 1 or 2, are handled appropriately: if `N` is 1, the function returns an empty list, and if `N` is 2, it returns a list containing only the number 2.
