The code snippet updates the value of `dyn[j][last]` to be the sum of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of the string `s`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `dyn[j][last]` is set to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.
2. The value of `j` is 0, so `dyn[0][last]` is updated.
3. `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, which is the index corresponding to the first character of `s` in the alphabet.
4. `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, which is the index corresponding to the last character of `s` in the alphabet.
5. `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`.

Thus, the value of `dyn[0][last]` is now `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `s` is a new user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`, `dyn[0][last]` is `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`, `j` is 0, and `dyn[0][first]` is greater than 0**
