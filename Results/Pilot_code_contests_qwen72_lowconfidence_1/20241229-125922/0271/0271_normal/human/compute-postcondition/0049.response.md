Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `s` is a new user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`. For all `j` from 0 to 25, if `dyn[j][first] > 0`, then `dyn[j][last]` is `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. Otherwise, `dyn[j][last]` remains unchanged.**
