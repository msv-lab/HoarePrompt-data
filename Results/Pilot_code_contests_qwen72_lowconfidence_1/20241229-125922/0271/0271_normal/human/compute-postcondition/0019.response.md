To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is greater than 0.
  - `i` is 0.
  - The list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
  - `__author__` is 'Rikishi'.
  - `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`.
  - `s` is a user input string.
  - `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
  - `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.
  - `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop `for i in range(n):` will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The list of names has `n` elements.
   - The `dyn` matrix is updated based on the user input string `s`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Increment `i` from 0 to 1.
   - Ensure that `n` remains greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

### Updated State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- The list of names remains a list of `n` strings.
- `__author__` remains 'Rikishi'.
- The `dyn` matrix remains updated as described.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`**
