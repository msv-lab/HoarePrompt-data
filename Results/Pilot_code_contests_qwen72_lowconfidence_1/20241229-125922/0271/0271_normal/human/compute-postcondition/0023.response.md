To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'
- `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`
- `s` is a user input string
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`
- `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(26):` will iterate over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive), which means it will always execute 26 times regardless of the other variables.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute because the range `range(26)` guarantees that the loop will run 26 times.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute 26 times, no modifications to the state are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`**
