The provided code snippet updates the variable `last` by calculating the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of the string `s` and the ASCII value of `'a'`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'
- `s` is a new user input string
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`
- `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`
- `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`
- `dyn[j][last]` remains unchanged for all other `j` where `dyn[j][first] <= 0`

The code snippet:
```
last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')
```
updates the value of `last` to `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.

Since this is the same calculation that was already specified in the initial state for `last`, the value of `last` does not change.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `s` is a new user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`, `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, and `dyn[j][last]` remains unchanged for all other `j` where `dyn[j][first] <= 0`.**
