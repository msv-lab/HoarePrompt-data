To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions under which the loop will proceed.

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'
- `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`
- `s` is a user input string
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`
- `j` is 2
- If `dyn[2][first] > 0`, then `dyn[2][last]` is `dyn[2][first] + len(s)`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 25 (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `j` from 2 to 3.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `names`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, `last`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 3. If `dyn[2][first] > 0`, then `dyn[2][last]` is `dyn[2][first] + len(s)`.**
