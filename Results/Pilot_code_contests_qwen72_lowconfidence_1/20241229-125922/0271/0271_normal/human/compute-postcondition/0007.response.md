To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(26):` will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 25. This is always true because the range function with an argument of 26 will always produce this sequence.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
   - `__author__` is 'Rikishi'.
   - `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0.
   - `s` is a user input string.
   - `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
   - `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop `for j in range(26):` will always execute regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `names`, `__author__`, `dyn`, `s`, `first`, or `last`, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts remains unchanged.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`**
