According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this increment in `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`. If `dyn[j][first] > 0`, then `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. `j` is 1.**
