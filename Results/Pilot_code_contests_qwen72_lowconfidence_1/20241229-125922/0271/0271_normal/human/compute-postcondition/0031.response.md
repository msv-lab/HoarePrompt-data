The code snippet updates the value of `dyn[j][last]` to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`. Let's break down the changes:

- `j` is 3.
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.
- The length of the string `s` is `len(s)`.

The value of `dyn[3][last]` is updated to `dyn[3][first] + len(s)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 3, `dyn[3][last]` is `dyn[3][first] + len(s)`.**
