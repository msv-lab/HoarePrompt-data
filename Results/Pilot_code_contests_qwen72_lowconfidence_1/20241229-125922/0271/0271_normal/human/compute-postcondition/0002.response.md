The code initializes a 2D list named `dyn` with dimensions 26x26, where each element is initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, the list of names, or `__author__`.

Output State: **n is an integer obtained from user input, the list of names is a list of n strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0**.
