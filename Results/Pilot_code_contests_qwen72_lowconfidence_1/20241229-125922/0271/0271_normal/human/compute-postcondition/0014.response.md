To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'.
- `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0.
- `s` is a user input string.
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `j` is within this range.
2. **State Update**: After each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

### Current State:
- `j` is 1.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2.
- All other states remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop condition or the loop body (as per the given information).

### Updated State:
- `j` is 2.
- All other states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 2**.
