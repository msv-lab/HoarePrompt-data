Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n > 0` or undefined if `n = 0`, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0` and for each string `s` in the list of names, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`. If `n = 0`, `dyn` remains a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0.**
