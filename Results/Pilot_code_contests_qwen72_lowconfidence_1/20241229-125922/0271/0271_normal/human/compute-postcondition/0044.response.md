The code snippet updates the value of `dyn[j][last]` based on the existing value of `dyn[j][first]` and the length of the string `s`. Hereâ€™s the detailed impact:

- `j` is 1.
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
- `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`.
- `dyn[j][last]` is updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)`.

Since `j` is 1, the specific row in the `dyn` matrix being updated is the second row (index 1). The value at `dyn[1][last]` is set to the sum of the value at `dyn[1][first]` and the length of `s`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `s` is a new user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`, if `dyn[0][first] > 0`, then `dyn[0][last]` is `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`. Otherwise, `dyn[0][last]` remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `dyn[1][last]` is `dyn[1][first] + len(s)`**.
