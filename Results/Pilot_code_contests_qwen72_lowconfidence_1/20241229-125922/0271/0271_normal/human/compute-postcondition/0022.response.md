The code snippet `last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')` updates the value of `last` based on the last character of the string `s`. The ASCII value of the last character of `s` is subtracted by the ASCII value of `'a'`, resulting in an index value corresponding to the position of the last character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'
- `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`
- `s` is a user input string
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`
- `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`

After executing the code snippet:
- `last` is now set to the index value of the last character of `s` in the alphabet.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is `max(dyn[first][last], len(s))`**
