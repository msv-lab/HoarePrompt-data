To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop's condition and the state variables involved.

### Given:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'.
- `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`.
- `s` is a user input string.
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`.
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 25 (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- `j` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0`, `s` is a user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `j` is 2**.
