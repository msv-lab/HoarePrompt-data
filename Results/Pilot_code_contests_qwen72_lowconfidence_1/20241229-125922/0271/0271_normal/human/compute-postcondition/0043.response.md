To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters
- `__author__` is 'Rikishi'
- `s` is a new user input string
- `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`
- `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`
- `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`
- `j` is 0
- If `dyn[0][first] > 0`, then `dyn[0][last]` is `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`. Otherwise, `dyn[0][last]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive), meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 25.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `j` should be incremented from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `names`, `__author__`, `s`, `first`, `last`, `dyn`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `names` is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `s` is a new user input string, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`, if `dyn[0][first] > 0`, then `dyn[0][last]` is `dyn[0][first] + len(s)`. Otherwise, `dyn[0][last]` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**.
