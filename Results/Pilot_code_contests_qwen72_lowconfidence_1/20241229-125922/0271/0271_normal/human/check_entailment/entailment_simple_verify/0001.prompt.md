You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings "ab" and "ba" is called "abba", and the dynasty, which had only the king "abca", is called "abca".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name A is earlier in the list than B, then if A and B were kings, then king A ruled before king B.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of names in Vasya's list. Next n lines contain n abbreviated names, one per line. An abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 10 characters.

Output

Print a single number — length of the sought dynasty's name in letters.

If Vasya's list is wrong and no dynasty can be found there, print a single number 0.

Examples

Input

3
abc
ca
cba


Output

6


Input

4
vvp
vvp
dam
vvp


Output

0


Input

3
ab
c
def


Output

1

Note

In the first sample two dynasties can exist: the one called "abcca" (with the first and second kings) and the one called "abccba" (with the first and third kings). 

In the second sample there aren't acceptable dynasties.

The only dynasty in the third sample consists of one king, his name is "c".
Program:
```
def func():
    __author__ = 'Rikishi'
    n = int(raw_input())
    dyn = [[0] * 26 for i in range(26)]
    for i in range(n):
        s = raw_input()
        first = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')
        last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')
        for j in range(26):
            if dyn[j][first] > 0:
                dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)
        dyn[first][last] = max(dyn[first][last], len(s))
    ans = max([dyn[i][i] for i in range(26)])
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the first and last letters of the dynasty do not match. According to the problem description, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king must coincide with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king. However, the program does not ensure this condition. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
ab
bc
ca
```

The correct output should be `6` because the dynasty "abca" is valid, but the program will output `0` because it does not check if the first letter of the first king matches the last letter of the last king. This violates the requirement that the first and last letters of the dynasty must match. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, and the list of names is a list of n strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
def func():
    __author__ = 'Rikishi'
    n = int(raw_input())
    dyn = [([0] * 26) for i in range(26)]
    for i in range(n):
        s = raw_input()
        
        first = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')
        
        last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')
        
        for j in range(26):
            if dyn[j][first] > 0:
                dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)
        
        dyn[first][last] = max(dyn[first][last], len(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n > 0` or undefined if `n = 0`, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0` and for each string `s` in the list of names, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`. If `n = 0`, `dyn` remains a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0.
    ans = max([dyn[i][i] for i in range(26)])
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
