You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important its bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long names are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the names of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name. Thus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by the berlanders VVP.

In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings replaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus, according to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the first name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders appreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders like perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the first king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in this dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first king coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king). This tradition, of course, has also been always observed.

The name of a dynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the kings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a dynasty of kings "ab" and "ba" is called "abba", and the dynasty, which had only the king "abca", is called "abca".

Vasya, a historian, has recently found a list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help Vasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed in Berland.

Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that is, if name A is earlier in the list than B, then if A and B were kings, then king A ruled before king B.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of names in Vasya's list. Next n lines contain n abbreviated names, one per line. An abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 10 characters.

Output

Print a single number — length of the sought dynasty's name in letters.

If Vasya's list is wrong and no dynasty can be found there, print a single number 0.

Examples

Input

3
abc
ca
cba


Output

6


Input

4
vvp

dam

Output

ab
c
def


Output

1

Note

In the first sample two dynasties can exist: the one called "abcca" (with the first and second kings) and the one called "abccba" (with the first and third kings). 

In the second sample there aren't acceptable dynasties.

The only dynasty in the third sample consists of one king, his name is "c".
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, and the list of names is a list of n strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters.
def func():
    __author__ = 'Rikishi'
    n = int(raw_input())
    dyn = [([0] * 26) for i in range(26)]
    for i in range(n):
        s = raw_input()
        
        first = ord(s[0]) - ord('a')
        
        last = ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')
        
        for j in range(26):
            if dyn[j][first] > 0:
                dyn[j][last] = dyn[j][first] + len(s)
        
        dyn[first][last] = max(dyn[first][last], len(s))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n > 0` or undefined if `n = 0`, the list of names is a list of `n` strings, each string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and having a length between 1 and 10 characters, `__author__` is 'Rikishi', `dyn` is a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0 except for those elements `dyn[j][last]` which are updated to `dyn[j][first] + len(s)` for all `j` where `dyn[j][first] > 0` and for each string `s` in the list of names, `first` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`, `last` is `ord(s[-1]) - ord('a')`, and `dyn[first][last]` is the maximum of its original value and `len(s)`. If `n = 0`, `dyn` remains a 26x26 list of lists where each element is 0.
    ans = max([dyn[i][i] for i in range(26)])
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings from the standard input, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length between 1 and 10 characters. It then constructs a 26x26 matrix `dyn` where each element represents the maximum possible length of a chain of strings that can be formed such that the last character of one string matches the first character of the next string. The function finally prints the maximum value in the diagonal of this matrix, which represents the longest such chain that can be formed using the given strings. If no valid chains exist, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` is 0, in which case the function initializes the matrix `dyn` to a 26x26 zero matrix and prints 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
