The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` converts the variable `lst2` into a set of unique integers. Since `lst2` was initially a list of integers, this operation will remove any duplicates and convert it into a set.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
