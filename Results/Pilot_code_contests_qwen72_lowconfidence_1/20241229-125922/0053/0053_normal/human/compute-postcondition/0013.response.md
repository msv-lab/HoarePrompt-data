The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure immediately. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged. However, the control flow is affected, which means we break out of the most immediate loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 1 element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` is 1, `i` is the first element in `lst1`. The current value of `i` is also an element in `lst2`. 'YES' is printed. (1, i) is printed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
