The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(1, i)
```

This line of code prints the number `1` and the value of `i`. The variables `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and `nk` are not modified by this code. Since the value of `i` is already stated to be in `lst2`, and no changes are made to `i` or any other variables, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, `i` is in `lst2`, and (1, `i`) has been printed.**
