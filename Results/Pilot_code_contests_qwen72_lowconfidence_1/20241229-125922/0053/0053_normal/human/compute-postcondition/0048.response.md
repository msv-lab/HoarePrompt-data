The code snippet `nk = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `nk`. This changes the value of `nk` from its previous state (if any) to `1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The print statement mentioned in the initial state has already been executed and does not affect the current state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, and '1, i' has been printed to the console.**
