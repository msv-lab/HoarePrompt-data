The code snippet `n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer representations of these parts to `n` and `m`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are already input integers. However, this line of code overrides the current values of `n` and `m` with new values from the input.
- `lst1` and `lst2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
- `nk` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
- The condition for the loop executing one more time (based on the range specified by `int(input())`) is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`**.
