According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the set `lst1`. The loop iterates over each element in `lst1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second element in `lst1`, and `lst1` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `lst1` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` will be the third element in `lst1`.

The value of `nk` and the condition that it is set to 1 if `i` is in `lst2` does not affect the state of the loop itself but only affects what happens inside the loop. Since the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `i` is found in `lst2`, we need to consider the state where the loop continues to the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0.**
