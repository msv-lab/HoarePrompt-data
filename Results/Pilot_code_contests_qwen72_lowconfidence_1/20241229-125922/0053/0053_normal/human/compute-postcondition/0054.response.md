The code snippet `nk = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `nk`. Since this is the only operation in the code snippet, the values of other variables remain unchanged. However, the precondition states that `nk` is already 1 if `i` is in `lst2`, and `nk` remains unchanged otherwise. Therefore, the assignment `nk = 1` does not change the state of the program if `i` is in `lst2`. If `i` is not in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

- `n` is the first integer from the previous input.
- `m` is the second integer from the previous input.
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one more element.
- `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`.
- `i` is the next element in `lst1`.
- If `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is 1 and '1, i' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `nk` is 1 (due to the assignment in the code snippet).
- 'YES' has been printed to the console.
- '1, i' has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one more element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, 'YES' has been printed to the console, '1, i' has been printed to the console.**
