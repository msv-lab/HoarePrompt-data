The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is within. Since no loops or conditional structures are explicitly mentioned in the context provided, we assume the `break` statement is breaking out of such a structure.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, (1, i) has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
