The code snippet prints the tuple `(1, i)` where `i` is the second element in `lst1`. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, and `nk` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, `i` is the second element in `lst1`**.
