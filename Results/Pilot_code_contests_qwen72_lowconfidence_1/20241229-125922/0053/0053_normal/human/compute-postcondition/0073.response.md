The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. Since the initial state mentions that `(1, i)` has been printed, and given that `i` is in `lst2`, this suggests the code was likely inside a loop iterating over `lst2`. The `break` statement would terminate this loop prematurely.

The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow does. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 1, `i` is in `lst2`, and (1, `i`) has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 1, `i` is in `lst2`, (1, `i`) has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
