The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, which removes any duplicate elements and changes the order of elements to be unordered. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input; `nk` is 0.**
