Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0. If `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1, (1, i) is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `nk` remains 0.***
