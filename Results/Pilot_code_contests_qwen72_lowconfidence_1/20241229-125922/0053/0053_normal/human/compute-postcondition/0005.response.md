The code snippet `nk = 0` initializes the variable `nk` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `lst1` is a list of integers from the input; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input; `nk` is 0.**
