The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. Since no loops or conditions are explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, we assume this `break` is intended to exit such a structure that is not shown here.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, and `1` and the third element of `lst1` are printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
