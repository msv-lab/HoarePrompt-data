The code prints 'YES' and does not alter any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0.**
