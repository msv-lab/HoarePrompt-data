The code snippet `print('YES')` only prints the string 'YES' to the console and does not alter the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0**
