The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. No variables are modified by this statement itself, so the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the context of being outside the loop or condition.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is 1, and the current value of `i` is an element of `lst2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
