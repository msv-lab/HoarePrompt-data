The provided code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This operation overwrites the previous values of `n` and `m` with the new values provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of common elements, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
