The code snippet `print(1, i)` prints the integer `1` followed by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the third element in `lst1`. No variables are modified by this code, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0, and `1` and the third element of `lst1` are printed.**
