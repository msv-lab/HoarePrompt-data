The code snippet `print('NO')` prints the string `'NO'` to the console. This action does not alter the values of any variables or the state of the program, except for the side effect of outputting text.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` is 0, indicating that no element in `lst1` is found in `lst2`. No 'YES' message has been printed, and the loop has completed without finding any common elements. 'NO' has been printed.**
