To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input.
- `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input.
- `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`.
  - If `nk` is 0, indicating no common elements were found, 'NO' is printed.
  - If `nk` is 1, indicating at least one common element was found, 'YES' followed by (1, i) is printed, where `i` is the first common element found, and the loop terminates immediately.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are iterations left in the range specified by `int(input())`. This means the loop will run `int(input())` times.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input.
   - `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input.
   - `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining iterations in the range.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations left in the range must be greater than 0. Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are remaining iterations in the range.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`**.
