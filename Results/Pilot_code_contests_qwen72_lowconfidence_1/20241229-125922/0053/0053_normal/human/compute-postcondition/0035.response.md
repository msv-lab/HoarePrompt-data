The code snippet `nk = 0` sets the variable `nk` to 0. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here is the detailed impact:

- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `lst1` remains unchanged.
- `lst2` remains unchanged.
- `nk` is set to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the previous input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the new input, `nk` is 0, and the loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`.**
