The code prints the tuple `(1, i)`, where `i` is an element of `lst2`. This does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the print action has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is 0, and the current value of `i` is an element of `lst2`. (1, i) has been printed.**
