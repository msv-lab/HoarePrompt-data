Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`. If there is any common element between `lst1` and `lst2`, `nk` is 1, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '1, i' has been printed to the console where `i` is the first common element found. If there are no common elements, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.***
