The code snippet `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This action does not modify any of the existing variables or introduce new ones. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`. There are no common elements between `lst1` and `lst2`, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.**
