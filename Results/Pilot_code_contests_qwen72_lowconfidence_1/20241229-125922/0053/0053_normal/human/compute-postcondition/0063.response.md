`lst1` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from the current input, split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `lst2`, `nk`, and the condition for the user input for the loop remain unchanged. The new `lst1` contains the unique integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of common elements, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
