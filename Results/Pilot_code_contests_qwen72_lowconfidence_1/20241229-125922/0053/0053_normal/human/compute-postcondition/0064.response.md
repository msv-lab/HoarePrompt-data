The code snippet updates `lst2` to a new list of integers derived from the user's input, which is split into individual strings and then converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, `lst1`, `nk`, and the condition for the loop (user input for the loop must be greater than 0) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the new user input, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of common elements, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
