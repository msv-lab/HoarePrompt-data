The code snippet prints the tuple `(1, i)`, where `i` is the second element in `lst1`. This operation does not modify any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the print action has been performed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0, (1, i) has been printed.**
