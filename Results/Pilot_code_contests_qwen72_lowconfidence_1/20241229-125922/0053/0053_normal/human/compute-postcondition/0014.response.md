Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 1 element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the first element in `lst1`. If `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1, 'YES' is printed, and (1, i) is printed, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `nk` remains 0.***
