Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input. If `nk` is 0, indicating no common elements were found between `lst1` and `lst2`, the program does not print anything. If a common element is found, the program prints "YES" and the pair (1, `i`) where `i` is the first common element found.***
