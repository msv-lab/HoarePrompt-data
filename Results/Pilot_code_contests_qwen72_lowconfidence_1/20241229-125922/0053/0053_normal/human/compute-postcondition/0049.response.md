The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop (like a `for` or `while` loop) or switch statement, if present. However, since there's no loop or switch context mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement would have no effect in this context. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, and '1, i' has been printed to the console.**
