Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0 if no common elements are found between `lst1` and `lst2`, otherwise `nk` is 1. If a common element is found, the program prints "YES" and the pair (1, `i`) where `i` is the first common element found.**
