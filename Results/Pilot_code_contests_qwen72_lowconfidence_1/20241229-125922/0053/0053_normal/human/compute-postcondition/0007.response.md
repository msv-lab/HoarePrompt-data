The code `lst2 = set(lst2)` changes the type of `lst2` from a list to a set, which means it now contains only unique elements from the original list and is unordered.

Output State: **The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input; `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input; `nk` is 0.**
