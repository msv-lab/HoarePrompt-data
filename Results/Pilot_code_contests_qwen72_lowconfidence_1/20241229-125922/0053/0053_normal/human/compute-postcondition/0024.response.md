The value of `nk` is updated from 0 to 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 1, and `1` and the third element of `lst1` are printed.
