To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will run. The loop runs based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should represent the number of test cases.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The `input()` function reads a line from standard input, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer using `int()`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the integer value read from the input is greater than 0.
3. **Test Case Constraints**: According to the problem description, the function operates on multiple test cases, and the constraints ensure that the number of test cases is valid (i.e., at least 1).

### Adjusted State:
- The input must be a valid integer representing the number of test cases.
- This integer must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases.**
