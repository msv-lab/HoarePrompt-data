Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least one more element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. If `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
