Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` is 1 if any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`, otherwise `nk` is 0. If an element `i` in `lst1` is found in `lst2`, 'YES' is printed followed by (1, i), and the loop terminates immediately. If no such element is found, the loop completes without printing anything, and `nk` remains 0.**
