The code snippet provided is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console and does not alter any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one more element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`. If the new `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is 1 and '1, i' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `nk` remains unchanged. 'YES' has been printed to the console.**
