To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is the first integer from the previous input.
- `m` is the second integer from the previous input.
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`.
- `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`.
- `nk` is 0.
- The loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in lst1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `lst1` is not empty. If `lst1` is empty, the loop will not run even once.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `lst1` and `lst2` are sets of unique integers, but only `lst1` is used in the loop.
   - `nk` is 0, but it is not used in the loop condition.
   - The range specified by `int(input())` is mentioned, but it is not directly relevant to the loop condition in this context.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `lst1` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `nk`, and `lst2`) do not affect the loop's execution directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is 0**
