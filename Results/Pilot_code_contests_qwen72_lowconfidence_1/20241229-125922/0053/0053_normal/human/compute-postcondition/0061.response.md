To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from the previous input.
- `m` is the second integer from the previous input.
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`.
- `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`.
- If there is any common element between `lst1` and `lst2`, `nk` is 1, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '1, i' has been printed to the console where `i` is the first common element found.
- If there are no common elements, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input `int(input())`.
- The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, indicating that the loop is simply running a fixed number of times without affecting the loop's internal state.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute again if the user input `int(input())` is greater than 0.
- Since the loop variable `_` is not used, none of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `lst1`, `lst2`, `nk`) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the user input for the loop to execute again. The other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `nk` is either 0 or 1 depending on the presence of common elements, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
