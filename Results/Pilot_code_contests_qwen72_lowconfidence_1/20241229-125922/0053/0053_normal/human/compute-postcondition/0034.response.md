The code snippet `lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and assigns the integer representations of these parts to the list `lst2`.

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
- `lst1` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
- `lst2` is updated to a list of integers from the new input.
- `nk` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.
- The condition for the loop executing one more time (based on the range specified by `int(input())`) is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a list of integers from the previous input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the new input, `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`, and the loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`.**
