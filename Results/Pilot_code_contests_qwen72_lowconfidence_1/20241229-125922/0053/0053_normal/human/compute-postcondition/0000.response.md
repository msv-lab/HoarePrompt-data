The `input` function is redefined to read a line from standard input (`stdin`), strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and return the result. This modification affects how input is handled in the program but does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, or the overall constraints.

Output State: **The function takes no arguments directly, but according to the problem description, it operates on multiple test cases where each test case consists of two arrays of integers a and b, with lengths n and m respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000. The `input` function now reads a line from standard input, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the result.**
