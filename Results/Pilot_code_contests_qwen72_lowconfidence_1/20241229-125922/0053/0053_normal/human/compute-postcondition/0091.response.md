Output State: **For each iteration of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, representing the lengths of two lists of integers `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively. `lst1` and `lst2` are converted to sets of unique integers. `nk` is a flag that indicates whether any common element was found between `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, `nk` is set to 1, 'YES' is printed followed by (1, `i`), where `i` is the first common element found, and the inner loop breaks. If no common element is found, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' is printed. After all iterations, the loop will have processed each test case, printing the appropriate output for each case based on the presence of common elements in the sets `lst1` and `lst2`.**
