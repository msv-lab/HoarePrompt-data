Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, and `nk` indicates whether any element in `lst1` is also in `lst2`. If `nk` is 0, indicating no common elements were found, 'NO' is printed. If `nk` is 1, indicating at least one common element was found, 'YES' followed by (1, i) is printed, where `i` is the first common element found, and the loop terminates immediately.***
