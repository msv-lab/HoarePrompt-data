Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`. If `i` is an element of `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
