Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two arrays of integers `a` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000). For each test case, it converts the arrays into sets of unique integers. It then checks if there is any common element between the two sets. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the common element (specifically, '1' and the common element). If no common element is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, having printed the appropriate output for each test case based on the presence of common elements in the sets. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If either `lst1` or `lst2` is empty, the function will correctly print 'NO' since there can be no common elements.
- The function only prints the first common element found and does not list all common elements, which might be a limitation depending on the requirements.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the specified range) and assumes the input is always valid.
- The function does not store or return any results; it only prints the output directly to the console.
