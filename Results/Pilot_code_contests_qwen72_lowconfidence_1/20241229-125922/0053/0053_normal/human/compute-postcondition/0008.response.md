To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop is iterating over `lst1`, which is a set of unique integers.
- For the loop to execute, `lst1` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input.
- `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input.
- `nk` is 0.

The key point here is that the loop will only execute if `lst1` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst1` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 1 element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` is 0, `i` is the first element in `lst1`**
