The provided Python code snippet only contains a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. This operation does not alter the state of any variables or the program's flow. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing 'YES'.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, and the next `i` is the second element in `lst1`.**
