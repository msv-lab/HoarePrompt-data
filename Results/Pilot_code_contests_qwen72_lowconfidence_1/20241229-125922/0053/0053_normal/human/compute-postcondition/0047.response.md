The code snippet `print(1, i)` prints the integer `1` and the value of the variable `i` to the console. It does not alter any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`, `nk` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, and '1, i' has been printed to the console.**
