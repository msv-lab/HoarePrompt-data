The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 1, `i` is the second element in `lst1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
