Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `i` is the third element in `lst1`, `nk` is 0. If `i` (the third element in `lst1`) is in `lst2`, `nk` is set to 1, and `1` and the third element of `lst1` are printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
