Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least two elements, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`. If `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is 1 and '1, i' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `nk` remains unchanged.***
