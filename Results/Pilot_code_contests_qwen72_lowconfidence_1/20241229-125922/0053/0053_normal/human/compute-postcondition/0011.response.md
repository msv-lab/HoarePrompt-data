The code prints the tuple `(1, i)` where `i` is the first element in `lst1` and also an element in `lst2`. The state of the variables does not change as a result of this print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the input and must have at least 1 element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the input, `nk` is 0, `i` is the first element in `lst1`. The current value of `i` is also an element in `lst2`. 'YES' is printed. (1, i) is printed.**
