The code `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the variable `lst1` into a set of unique integers, which it already is according to the initial state. This means the conversion does not change the content of `lst1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input, `lst2` is a list of integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.**
