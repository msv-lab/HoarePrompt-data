The code `print(1, i)` will print the values 1 and `i` to the console. Since `i` is the next element in `lst1`, and according to the initial state, if this `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is 1 and '1, i' has already been printed to the console. However, the current code snippet will print '1, i' again regardless of whether `i` is in `lst2`.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows, with the additional effect of printing '1, i' to the console:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1` and must have at least one more element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst2`, `i` is the next element in `lst1`. If the new `i` is in `lst2`, `nk` is 1 and '1, i' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `nk` remains unchanged. 'YES' has been printed to the console, and '1, i' has been printed to the console.**
