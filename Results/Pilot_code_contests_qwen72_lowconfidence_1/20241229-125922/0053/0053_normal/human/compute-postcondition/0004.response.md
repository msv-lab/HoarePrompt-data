The code snippet `lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a new line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `lst2`.

Given the Initial State:
- The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `lst1` is a list of integers from the input.

The impact of the code:
- A new list `lst2` is created containing integers read from the input.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- The list `lst1` remains unchanged.
- The number of test cases (the initial input) remains valid but is not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**The input is a valid integer greater than 0, representing the number of test cases; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `lst1` is a list of integers from the input; `lst2` is a list of integers from the input.**
