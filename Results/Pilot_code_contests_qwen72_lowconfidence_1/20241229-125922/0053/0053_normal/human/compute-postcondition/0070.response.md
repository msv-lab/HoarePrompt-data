The provided code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs the string 'YES'. This operation does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the current input, `m` is the second integer from the current input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the current input and must contain at least one element, `lst2` is a set of unique integers from the new user input, `nk` is 0, and the user input for the loop must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, the current value of `i` is in `lst2`.**
