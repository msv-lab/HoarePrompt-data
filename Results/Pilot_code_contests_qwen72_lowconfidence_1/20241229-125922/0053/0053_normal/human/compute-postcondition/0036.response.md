The code snippet `lst1 = set(lst1)` converts the list `lst1` into a set, removing any duplicate elements and changing its data type from a list to a set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer from the previous input, `m` is the second integer from the previous input, `lst1` is a set of unique integers from the previous list `lst1`, `lst2` is a list of integers from the new input, `nk` is 0, and the loop will execute one more time if there are remaining iterations in the range specified by `int(input())`.**
