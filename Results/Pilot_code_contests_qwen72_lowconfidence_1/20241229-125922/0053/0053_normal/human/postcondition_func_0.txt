The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two arrays of integers `a` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000). For each test case, it converts the arrays into sets of unique integers. It then checks if there is any common element between the two sets. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the common element (specifically, '1' and the common element). If no common element is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, having printed the appropriate output for each test case based on the presence of common elements in the sets.
