The function takes no arguments directly, but according to the problem description, it operates on multiple test cases where each test case consists of two arrays of integers a and b, with lengths n and m respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000.
