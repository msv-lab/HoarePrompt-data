t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, representing the lengths of the two arrays. The arrays a_1, ..., a_n and b_1, ..., b_m consist of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases do not exceed 1000.
