You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two arrays of integers a_1,…,a_n and b_1,…,b_m.

Your task is to find a non-empty array c_1,…,c_k that is a subsequence of a_1,…,a_n, and also a subsequence of b_1,…,b_m. If there are multiple answers, find one of the smallest possible length. If there are still multiple of the smallest possible length, find any. If there are no such arrays, you should report about it.

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1] and [4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4].

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Next 3t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the lengths of the two arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,…,a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1,…,b_m (1≤ b_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 1000 (∑_{i=1}^t n_i, ∑_{i=1}^t m_i≤ 1000).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if a solution exists, or "NO" otherwise.

If the answer is "YES", on the next line output an integer k (1≤ k≤ 1000) — the length of the array, followed by k integers c_1,…,c_k (1≤ c_i≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.

If there are multiple solutions with the smallest possible k, output any.

Example

Input


5
4 5
10 8 6 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 1
3
3
1 1
3
2
5 3
1000 2 2 2 3
3 1 5
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


YES
1 4
YES
1 3
NO
YES
1 3
YES
1 2

Note

In the first test case, [4] is a subsequence of [10, 8, 6, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This array has length 1, it is the smallest possible length of a subsequence of both a and b.

In the third test case, no non-empty subsequences of both [3] and [2] exist, so the answer is "NO".
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        nk = 0
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the requirement to find the smallest possible subsequence correctly. It only checks for common elements between the two sets and prints the first common element it finds. However, it does not ensure that the subsequence found is the smallest possible length among all possible common subsequences. 

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
5 6
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6 7 8
```

The program will output:
```
YES
1 3
```

However, the smallest possible subsequence that is common to both arrays is `[3, 4, 5]`, which has a length of 3. Therefore, the program's output is incorrect for this case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments directly, but according to the problem description, it operates on multiple test cases where each test case consists of two arrays of integers a and b, with lengths n and m respectively. The constraints are 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000.
def func():
    input = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst1 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        lst2 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        nk = 0
        
        lst1 = set(lst1)
        
        lst2 = set(lst2)
        
        for i in lst1:
            if i in lst2:
                print('YES')
                print(1, i)
                nk = 1
                break
        
        if nk == 0:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: For each iteration of the loop, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, representing the lengths of two lists of integers `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively. `lst1` and `lst2` are converted to sets of unique integers. `nk` is a flag that indicates whether any common element was found between `lst1` and `lst2`. If a common element is found, `nk` is set to 1, 'YES' is printed followed by (1, `i`), where `i` is the first common element found, and the inner loop breaks. If no common element is found, `nk` remains 0, and 'NO' is printed. After all iterations, the loop will have processed each test case, printing the appropriate output for each case based on the presence of common elements in the sets `lst1` and `lst2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two arrays of integers `a` and `b` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1000, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 1000). For each test case, it converts the arrays into sets of unique integers. It then checks if there is any common element between the two sets. If a common element is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the common element (specifically, '1' and the common element). If no common element is found, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, having printed the appropriate output for each test case based on the presence of common elements in the sets.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
