Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code only finds a common element between the two arrays and outputs it if found. However, the problem requires finding the smallest subsequence that is common to both arrays. If there are multiple common elements, the code will output just one, which may not be the smallest subsequence.

Here is a specific case where the code fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
1 2
```

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
YES
1 2
```

In this case, the smallest common subsequence is `[2]`, but the code could output any of the common elements, such as `3`, `4`, or `5`. This does not guarantee the smallest subsequence, which is a requirement of the problem.

To fix this, the code needs to be modified to find the smallest common subsequence, not just any common element. This would involve a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming, to ensure that the smallest subsequence is found.
