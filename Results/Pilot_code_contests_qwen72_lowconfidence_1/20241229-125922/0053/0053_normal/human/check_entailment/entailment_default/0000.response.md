Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires finding a subsequence that is common to both arrays and is of the smallest possible length. While the current implementation checks for any common element and prints it if found, it does not necessarily find the smallest possible subsequence.

### Issues:
1. **Smallest Subsequence**: The problem states that if there are multiple answers, the function should find one of the smallest possible length. The current implementation only checks for the existence of a common element and does not ensure that the subsequence is the smallest possible. For example, if the arrays are `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, the smallest common subsequence is `[2]`, but the current implementation might print `[2, 3, 4]` if it finds these elements in both sets.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The current implementation correctly handles multiple test cases, but it does not ensure the smallest subsequence for each test case.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 4
  1 2 3 4
  2 3 4 5
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  1 2
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  YES
  1 2
  ```
  (or any other common element, but not necessarily the smallest subsequence)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the smallest possible subsequence in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
