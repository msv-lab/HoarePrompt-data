Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Smallest Possible Subsequence**: The problem requires finding a subsequence of the smallest possible length if there are multiple valid subsequences. The provided program simply finds the first common element between the two sets and prints it as the subsequence. This approach does not guarantee that the subsequence is the smallest possible length. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   5 5
   1 2 3 4 5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```
   The program will output:
   ```
   YES
   1 1
   ```
   However, a valid and smaller subsequence would be `[1]`, which is already the smallest possible length. But the program does not check for this.

2. **Handling No Common Elements**: The program correctly handles the case where there are no common elements by printing "NO". This part of the program is correct.

3. **Output Format**: The program correctly outputs "YES" followed by the length and the subsequence if a common element is found, and "NO" if no common element is found. However, the subsequence might not be the smallest possible length, as mentioned above.

To make the program correct, it should:
- Find all common elements between the two sets.
- Determine the smallest subsequence from these common elements.
- Print the smallest subsequence if it exists, or "NO" if no common elements are found.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    input = lambda: stdin.readline().strip()
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        lst1 = set(map(int, input().split()))
        lst2 = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        common_elements = lst1 & lst2
        
        if common_elements:
            print('YES')
            print(1, min(common_elements))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program finds the smallest possible subsequence by using the intersection of the two sets and selecting the minimum element from the common elements. This way, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
