Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies a common subsequence between the two input arrays, `lst1` and `lst2`. It does this by converting both lists to sets and then checking for any common elements. If a common element is found, it prints "YES" followed by the length of the subsequence (which is 1 in this case) and the element itself. If no common element is found, it prints "NO".

This approach works for all potential cases because:
1. It handles the requirement of finding a subsequence that is present in both arrays.
2. It ensures that the subsequence is the smallest possible length by checking for individual common elements.
3. It correctly outputs "NO" when there are no common elements, indicating that no such subsequence exists.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
