Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Smallest Subsequence Requirement**: The problem description specifies that if there are multiple common subsequences, the program should find one of the smallest possible length. However, the provided program only checks for a single common element and immediately prints it as the result. This means it fails to consider subsequences of more than one element, which might be smaller than some other longer subsequences.

2. **Handling Multiple Common Elements**: The program stops after finding the first common element and does not check for other common elements that could form a shorter subsequence. For example, if both arrays contain multiple common elements, the program will only output the first one it finds, which may not be part of the shortest subsequence.

3. **Subsequence Definition**: The program treats the problem as finding a common element between two sets, which is not the same as finding a common subsequence. A subsequence can consist of multiple elements in the same order, and the program does not account for this.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```

**Expected Output**:
```
YES
1 2
```

**Actual Output**:
```
YES
1 2
```

While the actual output is correct for this specific case, it does not guarantee that the program will always find the smallest subsequence. For instance, consider another input:
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```

If the program were to find the subsequence `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is a valid common subsequence, it would still output the first common element `2` and not consider the entire subsequence, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest common subsequence as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
