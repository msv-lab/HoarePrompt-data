Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with how it reads input. Specifically, `n` is read as a string, and `xrange(n)` will raise a TypeError because `xrange()` expects an integer. This will cause the program to fail for any input.

To fix this, `n` should be converted to an integer before being used in `xrange(n)`:

```python
import bisect

def func():
    n = int(input())  # Convert n to an integer
    a = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]  # Also convert each element to an integer
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
    for i in range(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break
```

This corrected version should work correctly for the given problem description.
