Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `xrange`, which is specific to Python 2. However, the standard for modern Python is Python 3, where `range` should be used instead of `xrange`. This can lead to issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Input Conversion**: The program reads input values as strings using `input()` and stores them directly in the list `a`. These strings should be converted to integers before being used in the algorithm. The current implementation will cause a `TypeError` when `bisect.bisect_left` is called because it expects integers, not strings.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where `n` is 0 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 0, the output should be 0. However, the program will attempt to create a list `dp` of length 0, which will result in an empty list, and the subsequent loop will not execute, leading to no output.

4. **Final Output**: The program prints the index of the first `float('inf')` in the `dp` list, which is not necessarily the correct length of the LIS. The correct length of the LIS should be the number of elements in `dp` that are not `float('inf')`.

### Corrected Version of the Program:
```python
import bisect

def find_lis_length():
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
    
    # Find the length of the LIS
    lis_length = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if dp[i] != float('inf'):
            lis_length += 1
        else:
            break
    
    print(lis_length)

# Example usage
# find_lis_length()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` as an integer and each element of `a` as an integer.
- **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized with `float('inf')` and updated correctly.
- **LIS Length Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the length of the LIS by counting the number of elements in `dp` that are not `float('inf')`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is 0, the program will print 0, as required.

This corrected version of the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.
