You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For a given sequence A = {a0, a1, ... , an-1}, find the length of the longest increasing subsequnece (LIS) in A.

An increasing subsequence of A is defined by a subsequence {ai0, ai1, ... , aik} where 0 ≤ i0 < i1 < ... < ik < n and ai0 < ai1 < ... < aik.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000
* 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109

Input

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, and A is a list of n integers where each element ai satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]
    dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]
    for i in xrange(n):
        dp[bisect.bisect_left(dp, a[i])] = a[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order. If `n` is 0, `dp` is an empty list.
    for i in xrange(n):
        if dp[i] == float('inf'):
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order. If `n` is 0, `dp` is an empty list and no value is printed. If `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be the index of the first `float('inf')` in `dp` if it exists, and this value will be printed. If no `float('inf')` is found, `i` will be `n-1` and no value will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then processes these inputs to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of `a`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element represents the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of a given length. After processing, the function prints the length of the LIS. If the input list `a` is empty (`n` is 0), the function prints 0. If the input list `a` contains elements, the function prints the length of the LIS.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
