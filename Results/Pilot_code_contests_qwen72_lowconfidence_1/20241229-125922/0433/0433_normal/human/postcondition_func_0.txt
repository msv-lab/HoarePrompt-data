The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then processes these inputs to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of `a`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element represents the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of a given length. After processing, the function prints the length of the LIS. If the input list `a` is empty (`n` is 0), the function prints 0. If the input list `a` contains elements, the function prints the length of the LIS.
