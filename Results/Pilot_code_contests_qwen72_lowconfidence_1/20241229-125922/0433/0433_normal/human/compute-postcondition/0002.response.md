The code snippet `dp = [float('inf') for _ in xrange(n)]` creates a new list `dp` with `n` elements, where each element is initialized to `float('inf')` (which represents infinity in Python).

- `dp` is now a list of `n` elements, each set to `float('inf')`.
- The variables `n`, `A`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an input string, A is a list of n integers where each element ai satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109, a is a list of n strings where each element is an input string, dp is a list of n elements where each element is float('inf').**
