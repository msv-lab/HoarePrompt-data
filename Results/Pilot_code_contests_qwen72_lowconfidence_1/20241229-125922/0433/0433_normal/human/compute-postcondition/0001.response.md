The code snippet `a = [input() for i in xrange(n)]` iterates over the range defined by `n`, taking input from the user `n` times and storing each input in the list `a`. Each input is taken as a string since `input()` without conversion will treat the input as a string. The list `A` remains unchanged because `a` is a new list being created, not modifying `A`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an input string, A is a list of n integers where each element ai satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 109, a is a list of n strings where each element is an input string.**
