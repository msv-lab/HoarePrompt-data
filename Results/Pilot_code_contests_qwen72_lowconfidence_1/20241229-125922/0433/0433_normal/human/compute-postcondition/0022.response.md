Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `A` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` remains a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` remains a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2, and `dp[2]` is not `float('inf')`. If `dp[2]` is `float('inf')`, the value 2 is printed to the console and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
