Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input. It then processes these inputs to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of `a`. The function constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element represents the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of a given length. After processing, the function prints the length of the LIS. If the input list `a` is empty (`n` is 0), the function prints 0. If the input list `a` contains elements, the function prints the length of the LIS. **

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and then reads `n` integers into the list `a`.
- **Dynamic Programming Array**: The function initializes a `dp` array with `n` elements, all set to `float('inf')`. This array is used to store the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of each possible length.
- **Filling the DP Array**: The function iterates over each element in `a` and uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the position in `dp` where the current element should be placed to maintain the non-decreasing order. This effectively builds the LIS.
- **Finding the Length of LIS**: After filling the `dp` array, the function iterates through `dp` to find the first occurrence of `float('inf')`, which indicates the end of the LIS. The index `i` of this occurrence is printed, representing the length of the LIS.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `n` is 0, the function prints 0.
  - If all elements in `a` form an increasing sequence, the function will print `n`.
  - If there are duplicates in `a`, the function still correctly computes the LIS length.

### Final State:
- **Variables**:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of elements in the input list.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers read from user input.
  - `dp`: A list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order, representing the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of a given length.
- **Output**:
  - The function prints the length of the longest increasing subsequence of `a`. If `n` is 0, it prints 0.
