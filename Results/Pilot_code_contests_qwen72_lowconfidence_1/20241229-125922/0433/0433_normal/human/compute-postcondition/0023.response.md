To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string.
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order. If `n` is 0, `dp` is an empty list.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    if dp[i] == float('inf'):
        print(i)
        break
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `dp[i]` is equal to `float('inf')`.
   - If `dp[i]` is `float('inf')`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no `dp[i]` is `float('inf')`, the loop completes all iterations.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains an empty list.
   - If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through the list `dp` until it finds an element that is `float('inf')` or completes all iterations.
   - If the loop finds an element `dp[i]` that is `float('inf')`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes all iterations without finding any `dp[i]` that is `float('inf')`, no value is printed, and the loop ends normally.

### Final Output State:
- **If `n` is 0**:
  - `dp` is an empty list.
  - No value is printed.

- **If `n` is greater than 0**:
  - `i` will be the index of the first occurrence of `float('inf')` in `dp` if such an element exists, and this value will be printed.
  - If no `float('inf')` is found, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list), and no value will be printed.

### Summary:
- **If `n` is 0**:
  - `dp` is an empty list.
  - No value is printed.

- **If `n` is greater than 0**:
  - `i` will be the index of the first `float('inf')` in `dp` if it exists, and this value will be printed.
  - If no `float('inf')` is found, `i` will be `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order. If `n` is 0, `dp` is an empty list and no value is printed. If `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be the index of the first `float('inf')` in `dp` if it exists, and this value will be printed. If no `float('inf')` is found, `i` will be `n-1` and no value will be printed.**
