Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `A` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` remains a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` remains a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1. If `dp[i]` is equal to `float('inf')`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.***
