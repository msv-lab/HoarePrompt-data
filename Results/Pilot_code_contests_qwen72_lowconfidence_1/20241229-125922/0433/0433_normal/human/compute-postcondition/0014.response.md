Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order, `i` is 0. If `dp[i]` is `float('inf')`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
