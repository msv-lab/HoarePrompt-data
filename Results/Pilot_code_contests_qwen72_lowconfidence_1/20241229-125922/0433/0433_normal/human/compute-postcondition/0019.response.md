To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `A` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string.
- `dp` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is 1.
- The loop breaks if `dp[i]` is equal to `float('inf')`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `dp[1]` is not `float('inf')` (since the loop did not break).

3. **Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - `dp[2]` must not be `float('inf')` for the loop to proceed without breaking.

### Conclusion:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
- `dp[2]` must not be `float('inf')`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `A` remains a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies \(0 \leq ai \leq 10^9\), `a` remains a list of `n` strings where each element is an input string, `dp` remains a list of `n` elements where each element is a value from `a` in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2, and `dp[2]` is not `float('inf')`**.
