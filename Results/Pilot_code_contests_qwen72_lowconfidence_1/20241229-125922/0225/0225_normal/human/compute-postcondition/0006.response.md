The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. As a result, no further changes are made to the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3000, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `int(s[i][1])` is greater than `i`. The program has terminated.**
