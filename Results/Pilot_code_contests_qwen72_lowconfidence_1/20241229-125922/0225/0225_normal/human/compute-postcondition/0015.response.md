The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999, after decrementing, the new value of `n` will be in the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 2998. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2998, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, `i` is 1, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1**
