The code snippet provided only includes a print statement that outputs `-1`. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3000, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `int(s[i][1])` is greater than `i`.**
