The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer input where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\) and `n` must be greater than 2. After decrementing, `n` will be an integer where \(0 \leq n-1 \leq 2997\) and `n` will be greater than 1.

The other conditions remain unchanged:
- `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part.
- `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])`, the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, and the string `' '.join([s[2][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[2][1])`.
- `i` is 2.
- `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1.
- `int(s[2][1])` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(0 \leq n-1 \leq 2997\) and `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])`, the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, and the string `' '.join([s[2][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[2][1])`, `i` is 2, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1, `int(s[2][1])` is greater than 2.**
