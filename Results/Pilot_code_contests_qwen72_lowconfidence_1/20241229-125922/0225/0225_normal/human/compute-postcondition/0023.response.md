The code prints each element in the list `ans` on a new line. The variables `n`, `s`, and `ans` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the strings `' '.join([s[i][0], str(n_original - i)])` inserted at positions `int(s[i][1])` for all `i` from 0 to `n_original - 1`, where `n_original` is the original value of `n`.**
