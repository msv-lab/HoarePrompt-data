The given Python code snippet inserts a new element into the list `ans`. The new element is a string formed by joining `s[i][0]` and `str(n)`, separated by a space, and this new string is inserted at the position specified by `int(s[i][1])`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999
- `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part
- `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])`
- `i` is 1
- `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1

The code modifies the `ans` list by inserting a new string at the position `int(s[1][1])`. This new string is `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999
- `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part
- `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`
- `i` is 1
- `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, `i` is 1, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1**
