To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and the requirements of the loop.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer input where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\).
- `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part.
- `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`.
- `i` is 1.
- `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\).
   - `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part.
   - `ans` has specific strings inserted at positions determined by `s`.
   - `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `int(s[1][1])` remains greater than 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer input where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\), `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1**
