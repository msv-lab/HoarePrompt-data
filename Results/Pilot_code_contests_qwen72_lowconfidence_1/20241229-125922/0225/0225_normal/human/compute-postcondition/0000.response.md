The code defines a lambda function named `rstrs` which reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits the line into components based on whitespace, and converts each component to a string, returning a list of these strings.

Given the initial state, this lambda function does not immediately execute; it only defines the function. No input is read, and no variables are updated at this point. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `rstrs` function.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3000, and the input consists of n lines, each containing a string namei and an integer ai, where namei is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters of length up to 10, and 0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1. All names are distinct. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it, and returns a list of strings.**
