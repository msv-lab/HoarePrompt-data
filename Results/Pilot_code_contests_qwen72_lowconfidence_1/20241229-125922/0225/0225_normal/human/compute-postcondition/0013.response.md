Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])`, `i` is 1, and `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1. If `int(s[i][1]) > i`, the program has terminated.***
