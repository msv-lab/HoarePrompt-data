Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\), `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1. If `int(s[2][1])` is greater than 2, the program has terminated.***
