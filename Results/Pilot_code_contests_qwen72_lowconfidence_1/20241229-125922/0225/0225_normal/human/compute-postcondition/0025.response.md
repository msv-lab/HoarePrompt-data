Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing a string `namei` and an integer `ai`. It processes these inputs to generate a list of strings, ensuring that each string is placed at a specific position based on the value of `ai`. If any `ai` is greater than its index in the sorted list, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. Otherwise, it constructs the final list by inserting each string at the specified position and then prints the list, one string per line. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` is reduced to 0, `s` is a sorted list of input pairs, and `ans` contains the processed strings in the correct order. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Invalid Input**: If the input format is incorrect (e.g., `namei` is not a valid string, `ai` is out of bounds), the function may raise exceptions or behave unpredictably.
- **Duplicate Names**: The annotation states that all names are distinct, but if this assumption is violated, the function may still run but could produce unexpected results.
- **Empty Input**: If `n` is 0, the function will not enter the for loop and will print an empty list, which may or may not be the desired behavior.
- **Large Input**: For large values of `n` (up to 3000), the function's performance may degrade due to the repeated use of `insert`, which has a time complexity of O(n) for each insertion.
