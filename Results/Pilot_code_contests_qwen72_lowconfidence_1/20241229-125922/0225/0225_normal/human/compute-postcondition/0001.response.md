The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This updates the value of `n` from its initial state to a specific integer value, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3000. The lambda function `rstrs` remains defined as it was in the initial state, and no other changes are made to the program's state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**n is an integer input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3000, and the input consists of n lines, each containing a string namei and an integer ai, where namei is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters of length up to 10, and 0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1. All names are distinct. `rstrs` is a lambda function that reads a line from stdin, splits it, and returns a list of strings.**
