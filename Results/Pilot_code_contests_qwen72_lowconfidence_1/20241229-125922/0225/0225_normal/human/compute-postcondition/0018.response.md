The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. This means no further code is executed after this point, and the program ends.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state, but the program execution stops.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where \(0 \leq n \leq 2998\), `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])` and the string `' '.join([s[1][0], str(n)])` inserted at position `int(s[1][1])`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1, and the program has terminated.**
