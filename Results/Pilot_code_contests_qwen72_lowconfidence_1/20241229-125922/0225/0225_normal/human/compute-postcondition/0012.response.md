The `exit()` function call causes the program to terminate immediately. No further execution occurs after this point, and no changes are made to the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input where 0 ≤ n ≤ 2999, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the string `' '.join([s[0][0], str(n+1)])` inserted at position `int(s[0][1])`, `i` is 1, and `int(s[1][1])` is greater than 1, the program has terminated.**
