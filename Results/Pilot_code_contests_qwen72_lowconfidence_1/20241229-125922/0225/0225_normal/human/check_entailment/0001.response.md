Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program assigns the same height value `n` to each person in the queue, decrementing `n` after each insertion. This approach can lead to incorrect results because it assumes that the heights of the people in the queue are distinct and decrease monotonically, which is not necessarily true according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
a 0
b 1
c 2
d 3
```

The expected output should be:

```
a 180
b 170
c 160
d 150
```

However, the program will produce:

```
a 4
b 3
c 2
d 1
```

This output is incorrect because the heights are not within the specified range (1 to 109), and the heights do not reflect the correct order of people based on their `ai` values.

To fix this, the program should assign heights such that the `ai` values are satisfied, and the heights should be within the valid range. For example, assigning heights in the range from 1 to 109 in a way that satisfies the `ai` values would be a correct approach.
