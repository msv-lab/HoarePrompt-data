Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Height Assignment**: The program assigns the same height to all people in the queue, which is not in line with the requirement to assign unique heights such that the numbers \(a_i\) are correct. Specifically, the program sets the height of each person to the current value of `n` and decrements `n` for each insertion. This means that the heights are not unique and do not necessarily reflect the correct relative heights based on the \(a_i\) values.

2. **Insertion Logic**: The program uses the `insert` method to place each person in the queue at the position specified by \(a_i\). While this ensures that the number of taller people in front of each person is correct, it does not guarantee that the heights are unique and consistent with the \(a_i\) values.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the names and heights in the required format, but the heights are not unique and may not satisfy the condition that the number of taller people in front of each person is exactly \(a_i\).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the input:
```
4
a 0
b 2
c 0
d 0
```
The program will output:
```
a 4
c 3
d 2
b 1
```
However, this output is incorrect because the heights are not unique and do not correctly reflect the relative heights based on the \(a_i\) values. For example, `b` should have 2 taller people in front of it, but in the output, `b` has a height of 1, which is not consistent with the requirement.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the people based on their \(a_i\) values.
2. Assign unique heights to each person such that the number of taller people in front of each person is exactly \(a_i\).
3. Ensure that the heights are unique and within the specified range (1 to 10^9).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n = int(input())
    people = sorted([rstrs() for _ in range(n)], key=lambda x: int(x[1]))
    heights = [0] * n
    result = []

    for i in range(n):
        heights[int(people[i][1])] = n - i
        result.append((people[i][0], heights[int(people[i][1])]))

    if len(set(heights)) != n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for name, height in result:
            print(f"{name} {height}")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the heights are unique and correctly reflect the \(a_i\) values, thus meeting the problem description.
