Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple people have the same `ai` value and there is no valid way to arrange them such that the `ai` values are satisfied. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
a 1
b 1
c 1
```

In this case, each person claims that there is exactly one person taller than them standing in front of them. However, this is impossible because there cannot be three people all claiming that there is exactly one person taller than them in front of them. The program will output a potential arrangement, but this arrangement will not satisfy the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program should output `-1` for this input, but it does not.
