You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the Main Berland Bank n people stand in a queue at the cashier, everyone knows his/her height hi, and the heights of the other people in the queue. Each of them keeps in mind number ai — how many people who are taller than him/her and stand in queue in front of him.

After a while the cashier has a lunch break and the people in the queue seat on the chairs in the waiting room in a random order.

When the lunch break was over, it turned out that nobody can remember the exact order of the people in the queue, but everyone remembers his number ai.

Your task is to restore the order in which the people stood in the queue if it is possible. There may be several acceptable orders, but you need to find any of them. Also, you need to print a possible set of numbers hi — the heights of people in the queue, so that the numbers ai are correct.

Input

The first input line contains integer n — the number of people in the queue (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000). Then n lines contain descriptions of the people as "namei ai" (one description on one line), where namei is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters whose length does not exceed 10 characters (the i-th person's name), ai is an integer (0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1), that represents the number of people who are higher and stand in the queue in front of person i. It is guaranteed that all names are different.

Output

If there's no acceptable order of the people in the queue, print the single line containing "-1" without the quotes. Otherwise, print in n lines the people as "namei hi", where hi is the integer from 1 to 109 (inclusive), the possible height of a man whose name is namei. Print the people in the order in which they stand in the queue, starting from the head of the queue and moving to its tail. Numbers hi are not necessarily unique.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n = int(input())
    (s, ans) = (sorted([rstrs() for _ in range(n)], key=lambda x: int(x[1])), [])
    for i in range(n):
        if int(s[i][1]) > i:
            print(-1)
            exit()
        ans.insert(int(s[i][1]), ' '.join([s[i][0], str(n)]))
        n -= 1
    print('\n'.join(ans))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where multiple people have the same `ai` value and there is no valid way to arrange them such that the `ai` values are satisfied. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
a 1
b 1
c 1
```

In this case, each person claims that there is exactly one person taller than them standing in front of them. However, this is impossible because there cannot be three people all claiming that there is exactly one person taller than them in front of them. The program will output a potential arrangement, but this arrangement will not satisfy the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program should output `-1` for this input, but it does not.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3000, and the input consists of n lines, each containing a string namei and an integer ai, where namei is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters of length up to 10, and 0 ≤ ai ≤ n - 1. All names are distinct.
def func():
    rstrs = lambda : [str(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n = int(input())
    s, ans = sorted([rstrs() for _ in range(n)], key=lambda x: int(x[1])), []
    for i in range(n):
        if int(s[i][1]) > i:
            print(-1)
            exit()
        
        ans.insert(int(s[i][1]), ' '.join([s[i][0], str(n)]))
        
        n -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of lists, each containing a string and an integer, sorted by the integer part, `ans` contains the strings `' '.join([s[i][0], str(n_original - i)])` inserted at positions `int(s[i][1])` for all `i` from 0 to `n_original - 1`, where `n_original` is the original value of `n`.
    print('\n'.join(ans))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` lines, each containing a string `namei` and an integer `ai`. It processes these inputs to generate a list of strings, ensuring that each string is placed at a specific position based on the value of `ai`. If any `ai` is greater than its index in the sorted list, the function prints `-1` and exits immediately. Otherwise, it constructs the final list by inserting each string at the specified position and then prints the list, one string per line. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` is reduced to 0, `s` is a sorted list of input pairs, and `ans` contains the processed strings in the correct order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
