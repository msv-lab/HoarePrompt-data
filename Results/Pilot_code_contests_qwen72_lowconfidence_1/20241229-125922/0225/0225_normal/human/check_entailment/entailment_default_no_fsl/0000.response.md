Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases and does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Height Assignment**: The program assigns the same height to all people, decrementing `n` each time. This means that all people end up with distinct heights, but the heights are not necessarily within the required range of 1 to 109. The program uses `n` as the height, which starts from the total number of people and decreases. This can lead to heights that are out of the allowed range.

2. **Insertion Logic**: The program inserts people into the list based on their `ai` values. However, the insertion logic does not ensure that the heights are consistent with the `ai` values. For example, if two people have the same `ai` value, the program will insert them at the same position, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where multiple people have the same `ai` value. In such cases, the insertion logic can fail to produce a valid order.

### Example of Failure
Consider the following input:
```
4
a 0
b 1
c 1
d 2
```
The expected output could be:
```
a 150
c 170
b 160
d 180
```
However, the program will produce:
```
a 4
c 3
b 2
d 1
```
This output is incorrect because the heights are not within the required range and do not reflect the correct order based on the `ai` values.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not ensure that the heights are within the required range. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
