The function `func_5` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input. It assumes each integer is within the range [1, 100]. The function then returns a list of integers, where each integer in the list is one less than the corresponding integer from the user input. If the input contains integers outside the specified range or non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError`. The function does not validate the input range or handle invalid inputs, so users should ensure the input meets the expected format. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned list of modified integers, and the original input string is not retained.
