The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts this string into a list of integers and returns this list. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the input string, or an error has been raised if the input was invalid.
