The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input, and it does not provide any error handling for invalid input formats. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes a returned list of strings, which can be empty if the input was empty or contained only whitespace.
