Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple integers not in the list `p` that have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`. According to the problem description, if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one should be reported. However, the current implementation only prints the first such integer it encounters, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 5
4 7 10 6 5
```
The correct output should be `8`, but the current implementation will print `8` because it is the first integer it encounters with the smallest absolute difference from `6`. However, if the input were slightly different:
```
6 5
4 7 10 5 8
```
The correct output should still be `8`, but the current implementation might print `7` if `7` is encountered first, even though `8` is the smallest integer not in `p` with the same smallest absolute difference from `6`.

To fix this, the code should keep track of the smallest integer with the smallest absolute difference and print that integer. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
if (N == 0) :
    print(X)
    return
p = func_4()
p_max = max(p)
p_min = min(p)
if (X < p_min or p_max < X) :
    print(X)
else :
    closest_num = None
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
        if i not in p:
            diff = abs(i - X)
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                closest_num = i
            elif diff == min_diff and i < closest_num:
                closest_num = i
    print(closest_num)
```

This ensures that the smallest integer with the smallest absolute difference is always printed.
