You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
INF = 10 ** 20
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_8()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input and returns it. The function assumes that the input can always be converted to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user inputs a non-numeric value), the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the program will have returned the integer value entered by the user, and no other changes will be made to the program state.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return float(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a floating-point number provided by the user. If the user inputs a non-numeric value, a `ValueError` will be raised. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned floating-point number, which can be used in further computations or operations.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function executes, the program will have received and returned the user's input, which can be any valid string, including empty strings and strings containing special characters.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts this string into a list of integers and returns this list. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the input string, or an error has been raised if the input was invalid.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return [int(x) - 1 for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input. It assumes each integer is within the range [1, 100]. The function then returns a list of integers, where each integer in the list is one less than the corresponding integer from the user input. If the input contains integers outside the specified range or non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError`. The function does not validate the input range or handle invalid inputs, so users should ensure the input meets the expected format. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned list of modified integers, and the original input string is not retained.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return [float(x) for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by whitespace, converts each split element into a float, and returns a list of these floats. If the input contains non-numeric values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, an empty list will be returned.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input, and it does not provide any error handling for invalid input formats. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes a returned list of strings, which can be empty if the input was empty or contained only whitespace.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8():
    (X, N) = func_4()
    if N == 0:
        print(X)
        return
    p = func_4()
    p_max = max(p)
    p_min = min(p)
    if X < p_min or p_max < X:
        print(X)
    else:
        d = [abs(i - X) for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1) if i not in p]
        d_min = min(d)
        for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
            if i not in p:
                if abs(i - X) == d_min:
                    print(i)
                    break
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It prints a single integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If `N` (the number of elements in the list `p`) is 0, the function prints the value of `X` and returns.
2. If `N` is greater than 0, the function checks whether `X` is outside the range defined by the minimum and maximum values in the list `p` (`p_min` and `p_max`). If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, it prints `X`.
3. If `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function finds the integer `i` within this range that is not in the list `p` and has the smallest absolute difference from `X`. It then prints this integer `i`.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `N` is 0, the function correctly handles this case by printing `X` and returning `None`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is outside the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly prints `X`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly finds and prints the closest integer `i` not in `p` to `X`.
- However, if there are multiple integers `i` that are not in `p` and have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`, the function only prints the first such integer it encounters. This could lead to non-deterministic behavior if the order of elements in `p` changes.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
