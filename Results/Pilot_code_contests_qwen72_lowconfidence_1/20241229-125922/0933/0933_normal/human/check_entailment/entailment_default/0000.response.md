Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_8` does not always return the correct answer according to the problem description. Specifically, the issue arises when there are multiple integers not in the list `p` that have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`. The function only prints the first such integer it encounters, which may not be the smallest one. For example, consider the following input:

```
Input:
6 3
4 5 7
```

Here, `X = 6` and `p = [4, 5, 7]`. The integers not in `p` and within the range `[4, 7]` are `6` and `8`. Both `6` and `8` have the same absolute difference from `X` (which is 0 and 2, respectively). According to the problem description, if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one should be reported. However, the function will print `8` because it is the first such integer it encounters in the range `[4, 7]`. The correct output should be `6`.

This shows that the function does not handle the case where there are multiple integers with the same smallest absolute difference correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
