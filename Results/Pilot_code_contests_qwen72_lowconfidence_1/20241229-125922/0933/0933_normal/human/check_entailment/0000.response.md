Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the closest integer to `X` is outside the range `[p_min, p_max]`. For example, consider the input:

```
X = 100
N = 1
p = [99]
```

In this case, the closest integer to `X` that is not in the sequence `p` is `101`, but the program only checks integers within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, which is `[99, 99]`. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output `99` instead of `101`.
