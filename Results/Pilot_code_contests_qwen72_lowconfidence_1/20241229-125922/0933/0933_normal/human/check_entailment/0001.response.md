Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the nearest integer to \(X\) is outside the range of the sequence \(p_1, \ldots, p_N\). Specifically, the program only checks integers within the range defined by `p_min` and `p_max`, which may exclude the correct answer if it lies outside this range.

Example of failure:
- Input:
  ```
  3 2
  5 7
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  5
  ```

The program incorrectly outputs 5 because it does not consider integers less than `p_min` (which is 5 in this case). The correct answer should be 2, which is the nearest integer to 3 that is not in the sequence.
