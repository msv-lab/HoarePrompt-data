You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given are an integer X and an integer sequence of length N: p_1, \ldots, p_N.

Among the integers not contained in the sequence p_1, \ldots, p_N (not necessarily positive), find the integer nearest to X, that is, find the integer whose absolute difference with X is the minimum. If there are multiple such integers, report the smallest such integer.

Constraints

* 1 \leq X \leq 100
* 0 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq p_i \leq 100
* p_1, \ldots, p_N are all distinct.
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


X N
p_1 ... p_N


Output

Print the answer.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)
INF = 10 ** 20
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_8()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are used in this function. This function simply reads an integer from standard input and returns it.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a floating-point number that was input by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and simply returns the input from the standard input.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user through the standard input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers, and returns a list of integers.
def func_4():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the space-separated string of integers read from standard input.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function. This function reads input from the standard input, expecting it to be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is within the range [1, 100]. The function returns a list of integers, each being the corresponding input integer minus 1.
def func_5():
    return [(int(x) - 1) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is one less than the corresponding integer from the user input, which was a space-separated string of integers within the range [1, 100].

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_6():
    return [float(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of floats, each float is derived from the input provided as a string, where each element is separated by whitespace.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function. This function is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be formatted according to the problem's input specification.
def func_7():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input received from the standard input, split by whitespace.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, N is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, and p is a list of N distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100.
def func_8():
    X, N = func_4()
    if (N == 0) :
        print(X)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `p` is a list of N distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100. Additionally, `N` is greater than 0.
    p = func_4()
    p_max = max(p)
    p_min = min(p)
    if (X < p_min or p_max < X) :
        print(X)
    else :
        d = [abs(i - X) for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1) if i not in p]
        d_min = min(d)
        for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
            if i not in p:
                if abs(i - X) == d_min:
                    print(i)
                    break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is the last value checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]`. If a value `i` is found such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, this value will be printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`. If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, `X` is printed. Otherwise, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, and a list `d` is created where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`. The minimum value in `d` is `d_min`, and the last value `i` checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]` is such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, and this value `i` is printed.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
