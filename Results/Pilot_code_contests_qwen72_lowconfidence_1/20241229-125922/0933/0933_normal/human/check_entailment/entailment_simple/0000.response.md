Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Input**: The function `func_8()` correctly reads the input for `X` and `N` using `func_4()`, but it should also read the sequence `p` immediately after reading `N`. Instead, it reads `p` again inside the `func_8()` function, which is redundant and unnecessary.

2. **Range Consideration**: The program incorrectly limits the search range for the nearest integer to the range between `p_min` and `p_max`. According to the problem description, the nearest integer can be outside this range. For example, if `X = 100` and `p = [98, 99]`, the nearest integer not in `p` is `101`, but the program will only consider the range `[98, 99]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the nearest integer is outside the range of `p_min` and `p_max` correctly. For example, if `X = 1` and `p = [2, 3, 4]`, the nearest integer not in `p` is `0`, but the program will not consider `0` because it is outside the range `[2, 4]`.

To fix these issues, the program should consider the entire range of possible integers, not just the range between `p_min` and `p_max`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)

def func_4():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]

def func_8():
    X, N = func_4()
    if N == 0:
        print(X)
        return
    
    p = func_4()
    
    # Find the nearest integer not in p
    for i in range(-100, 201):  # Considering a wider range to cover all possible cases
        if i not in p:
            if abs(i - X) == min(abs(j - X) for j in range(-100, 201) if j not in p):
                print(i)
                return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_8()
```

In this corrected version:
- The input for `p` is read once after `N`.
- The search for the nearest integer is expanded to a wider range (`-100` to `200`) to ensure all possible integers are considered.
- The program correctly finds the nearest integer not in `p` and prints it.
