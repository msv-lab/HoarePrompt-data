Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_8` does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple integers not in the list `p` that have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`. According to the problem description, if there are multiple such integers, the smallest one should be reported. However, the current implementation only prints the first such integer it encounters, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
6 5
4 7 10 6 5
```

The sequence `p` is `[4, 7, 10, 6, 5]`. The integers not in `p` are `[1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, ...]`. The integer nearest to `X = 6` that is not in `p` is `8` (since `|8 - 6| = 2` and `|3 - 6| = 3`). However, if the list `p` were rearranged such that `3` appears before `8`, the function would incorrectly print `3` instead of `8`.

To fix this issue, the function should sort the candidates with the same smallest absolute difference and print the smallest one. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the function:

```python
def func_8():
    (X, N) = func_4()
    if N == 0:
        print(X)
        return
    p = func_4()
    p_max = max(p)
    p_min = min(p)
    if X < p_min or p_max < X:
        print(X)
    else:
        candidates = [i for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1) if i not in p]
        d = [abs(i - X) for i in candidates]
        d_min = min(d)
        for i in candidates:
            if abs(i - X) == d_min:
                print(i)
                break
```

This ensures that the smallest integer among those with the smallest absolute difference is printed.
