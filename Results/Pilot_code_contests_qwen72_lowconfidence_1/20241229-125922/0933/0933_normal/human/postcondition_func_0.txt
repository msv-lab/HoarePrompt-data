The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input and returns it. The function assumes that the input can always be converted to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user inputs a non-numeric value), the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the program will have returned the integer value entered by the user, and no other changes will be made to the program state.
