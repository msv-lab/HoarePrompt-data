#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are used in this function. This function simply reads an integer from standard input and returns it.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input and returns it. The function assumes that the input can always be converted to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user inputs a non-numeric value), the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the program will have returned the integer value entered by the user, and no other changes will be made to the program state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return float(input())
    #The program returns a floating-point number that was input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a floating-point number provided by the user. If the user inputs a non-numeric value, a `ValueError` will be raised. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned floating-point number, which can be used in further computations or operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are present in the function signature. The function `func_3` does not take any parameters and simply returns the input from the standard input.
def func_3():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user through the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function executes, the program will have received and returned the user's input, which can be any valid string, including empty strings and strings containing special characters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from standard input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers, and returns a list of integers.
def func_4():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the space-separated string of integers read from standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then converts this string into a list of integers and returns this list. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` or return an empty list, respectively. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the input string, or an error has been raised if the input was invalid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function. This function reads input from the standard input, expecting it to be a space-separated string of integers, where each integer is within the range [1, 100]. The function returns a list of integers, each being the corresponding input integer minus 1.
def func_5():
    return [(int(x) - 1) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is one less than the corresponding integer from the user input, which was a space-separated string of integers within the range [1, 100].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input. It assumes each integer is within the range [1, 100]. The function then returns a list of integers, where each integer in the list is one less than the corresponding integer from the user input. If the input contains integers outside the specified range or non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError`. The function does not validate the input range or handle invalid inputs, so users should ensure the input meets the expected format. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned list of modified integers, and the original input string is not retained.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_6():
    return [float(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of floats, each float is derived from the input provided as a string, where each element is separated by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by whitespace, converts each split element into a float, and returns a list of these floats. If the input contains non-numeric values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, an empty list will be returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function. This function is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be formatted according to the problem's input specification.
def func_7():
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input received from the standard input, split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-string input, and it does not provide any error handling for invalid input formats. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes a returned list of strings, which can be empty if the input was empty or contained only whitespace.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: X is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, N is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, and p is a list of N distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100.
def func_8():
    X, N = func_4()

        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `p` is a list of N distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100. Additionally, `N` is greater than 0.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is the last value checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]`. If a value `i` is found such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, this value will be printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`. If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, `X` is printed. Otherwise, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, and a list `d` is created where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`. The minimum value in `d` is `d_min`, and the last value `i` checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]` is such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, and this value `i` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It prints a single integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If `N` (the number of elements in the list `p`) is 0, the function prints the value of `X` and returns.
2. If `N` is greater than 0, the function checks whether `X` is outside the range defined by the minimum and maximum values in the list `p` (`p_min` and `p_max`). If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, it prints `X`.
3. If `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function finds the integer `i` within this range that is not in the list `p` and has the smallest absolute difference from `X`. It then prints this integer `i`.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `N` is 0, the function correctly handles this case by printing `X` and returning `None`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is outside the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly prints `X`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly finds and prints the closest integer `i` not in `p` to `X`.
- However, if there are multiple integers `i` that are not in `p` and have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`, the function only prints the first such integer it encounters. This could lead to non-deterministic behavior if the order of elements in `p` changes.
