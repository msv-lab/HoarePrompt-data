`p_max` is assigned the maximum value from the list `p`. Since `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` will be the largest integer in this range present in the list `p`. The values of `X`, `N`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `N` is greater than 0, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`**.
