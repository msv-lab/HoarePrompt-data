The code snippet `print(i)` outputs the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `p_min + 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min + 1`, and `p_min + 1` is printed.**
