Postcondition: ***`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min + 2`. If `abs(i - X)` equals `d_min`, `i` is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional structure. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
