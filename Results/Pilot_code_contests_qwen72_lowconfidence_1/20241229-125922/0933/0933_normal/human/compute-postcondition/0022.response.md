The `break` statement causes the program to exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement mentioned in the context, the `break` statement would typically cause an error if executed in this standalone context. However, following the instruction to only consider the state changes without describing the execution environment or errors:

- The values of the variables `X`, `N`, `p`, `p_max`, `p_min`, `d`, `d_min`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The statement `p_min + 1` is printed, which means the value of `p_min + 1` is displayed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min + 1`, `p_min + 1` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
