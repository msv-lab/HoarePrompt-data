Postcondition: ***`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `N` is greater than 0, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`. The current value of `X` is either less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`.***
