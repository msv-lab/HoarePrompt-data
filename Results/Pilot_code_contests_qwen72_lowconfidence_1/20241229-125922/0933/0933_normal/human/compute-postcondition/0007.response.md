`p_min` is assigned the minimum value from the list `p`. Since `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_min` will be the smallest integer in this range found in the list `p`. The values of `X`, `N`, `p`, and `p_max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `N` is greater than 0, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`**
