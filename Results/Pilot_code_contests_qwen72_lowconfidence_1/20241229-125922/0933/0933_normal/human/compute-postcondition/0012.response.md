The code snippet assigns the minimum value of the list `d` to the variable `d_min`. The list `d` contains the absolute differences between `X` and each integer in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in the list `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100
- `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100
- `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100
- `N` is greater than 0
- `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`
- `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`
- `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`
- `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`

After executing the code snippet:
- `d_min` is assigned the minimum value from the list `d`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `N` is greater than 0, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`**.
