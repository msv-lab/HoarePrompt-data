The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned in the context provided, the `break` statement would typically be used to exit such a structure. However, without the context of a loop or condition, the `break` does not change the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the addition that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we exit from the most immediate loop or conditional block we are in.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min`, and `i` is not in `p`. The absolute difference between `i` and `X` is equal to `d_min`. The value of `i` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
