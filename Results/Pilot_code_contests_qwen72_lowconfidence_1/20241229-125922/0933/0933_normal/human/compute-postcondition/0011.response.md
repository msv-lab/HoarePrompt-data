The code snippet creates a list `d` which contains the absolute differences between `X` and each integer in the range from `p_min` to `p_max` (inclusive), but only includes those integers that are not present in the list `p`.

- `d` is now a list of integers, each representing the absolute difference `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.
- The length of `d` depends on how many integers in the range `[p_min, p_max]` are not in `p`.

All other variables (`X`, `N`, `p`, `p_max`, `p_min`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `N` is greater than 0, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.**
