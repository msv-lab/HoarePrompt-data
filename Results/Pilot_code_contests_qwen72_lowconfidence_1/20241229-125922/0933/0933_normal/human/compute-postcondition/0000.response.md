The code snippet `X, N = func_4()` assigns new values to `X` and `N` by calling the function `func_4()`. Since the specific implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that `X` and `N` will take after the assignment. However, based on the initial state, we know that `X` and `N` will be reassigned to new values that satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ X ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, respectively.

The list `p` remains unchanged because it is not modified by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `p` is a list of N distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100.**
