To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100.
- `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100.
- `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100.
- `N` is greater than 0.
- `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`.
- `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`.
- `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`.
- `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.
- `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `p_min` to `p_max` inclusive. This means the loop will execute if `p_min` is less than or equal to `p_max`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `p_min` must be less than or equal to `p_max`.

3. **Given States**:
   - `p_min` and `p_max` are derived from the list `p`, which contains at least one element (since `N` is greater than 0).
   - Therefore, `p_min` and `p_max` are valid integers within the range [1, 100].

4. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - Since `p` is a list of distinct integers and `N` is greater than 0, `p_min` and `p_max` are well-defined and `p_min ≤ p_max`.
   - The condition `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max` ensures that `X` is within the range of `p_min` and `p_max`.

5. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `p_min` and increments by 1 until it reaches `p_max`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `p_min` is less than or equal to `p_max`, which is guaranteed by the given conditions. No additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min`**.
