Functionality: ** The function `func_8` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It prints a single integer based on the following conditions: 

1. If `N` (the number of elements in the list `p`) is 0, the function prints the value of `X` and returns.
2. If `N` is greater than 0, the function checks whether `X` is outside the range defined by the minimum and maximum values in the list `p` (`p_min` and `p_max`). If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, it prints `X`.
3. If `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function finds the integer `i` within this range that is not in the list `p` and has the smallest absolute difference from `X`. It then prints this integer `i`.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `N` is 0, the function correctly handles this case by printing `X` and returning `None`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is outside the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly prints `X`.
- If `N` is greater than 0 and `X` is within the range `[p_min, p_max]`, the function correctly finds and prints the closest integer `i` not in `p` to `X`.
- However, if there are multiple integers `i` that are not in `p` and have the same smallest absolute difference from `X`, the function only prints the first such integer it encounters. This could lead to non-deterministic behavior if the order of elements in `p` changes.**

In summary, the function ensures that it prints either `X` or the closest integer not in `p` to `X`, depending on the conditions described above. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `X` remains an integer within the specified range, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers within the specified range. The function always returns `None`.
