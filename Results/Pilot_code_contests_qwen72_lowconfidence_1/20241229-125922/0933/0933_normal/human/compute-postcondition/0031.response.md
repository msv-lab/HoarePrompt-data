Postcondition: ***`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`. If `X` is less than `p_min` or greater than `p_max`, `X` is printed. Otherwise, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, and a list `d` is created where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`. The minimum value in `d` is `d_min`, and the last value `i` checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]` is such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, and this value `i` is printed.***
