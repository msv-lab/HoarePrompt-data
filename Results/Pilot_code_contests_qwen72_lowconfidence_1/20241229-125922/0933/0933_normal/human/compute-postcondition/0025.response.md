To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100.
- `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100.
- `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100.
- `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`.
- `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`.
- `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`.
- `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.
- `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`.
- `i` is `p_min + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `[p_min, p_max + 1)`. This means `i` must be less than `p_max + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `p_min + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `i` will be `p_min + 2`.
   - The loop will execute if `p_min + 2` is less than `p_max + 1`, which simplifies to `p_min + 2 <= p_max`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `X`, `N`, `p`, `p_max`, `p_min`, `d`, and `d_min` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume these variables remain the same.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to `p_min + 2`.
- The loop will execute again if `p_min + 2 <= p_max`.

### Final State:
State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min + 2`.**
