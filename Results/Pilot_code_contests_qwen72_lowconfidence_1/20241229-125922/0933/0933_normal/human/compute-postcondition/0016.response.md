The code snippet `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `p_min`, which is the minimum value in the list `p`. The value of `i` is also specified to not be in `p`, and the absolute difference between `i` and `X` is equal to `d_min`.

Since the value of `i` is printed, it remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except that the value of `i` (which is `p_min`) has been printed.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is `p_min`, and `i` is not in `p`. The absolute difference between `i` and `X` is equal to `d_min`. The value of `i` has been printed.**
