To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the conditions and the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

### Initial State:
- `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100.
- `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100.
- `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100.
- `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`.
- `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`.
- `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`.
- `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.
- `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(p_min, p_max + 1):
    if i not in p:
        if abs(i - X) == d_min:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over all integers `i` from `p_min` to `p_max` inclusive.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is not in the list `p`.
   - If `i` is not in `p` and the absolute difference between `i` and `X` is equal to `d_min`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

2. **Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue until it finds an `i` that meets both conditions: `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`.
   - Once such an `i` is found, it is printed, and the loop terminates.
   - If no such `i` is found, the loop completes without printing anything.

3. **Output State**:
   - If the loop finds an `i` that meets the conditions, it will print that `i` and terminate.
   - If no such `i` is found, the loop will complete without printing anything.

### Final Output State:
- `X` remains an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100.
- `N` remains an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100.
- `p` remains a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100.
- `p_max` remains the maximum value in `p`.
- `p_min` remains the minimum value in `p`.
- `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`.
- `d` remains a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`.
- `d_min` remains the minimum value in `d`.
- `i` will be the last value checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that either meets the conditions or is the last value in the range if no conditions are met.
- If a value `i` is found such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, this value will be printed.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ `X` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 < `N` ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 100, `p_max` is the maximum value in `p`, `p_min` is the minimum value in `p`, `p_min ≤ X ≤ p_max`, `d` is a list of integers where each element is `abs(i - X)` for each `i` in the range `[p_min, p_max]` that is not in `p`, `d_min` is the minimum value in `d`, `i` is the last value checked in the range `[p_min, p_max]`. If a value `i` is found such that `i` is not in `p` and `abs(i - X) == d_min`, this value will be printed.**
