The function `func_4()` is called and its return value is assigned to `p`. Since the initial state specifies that `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies `1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100`, and `N` is greater than 0, the new value of `p` should also be a list of `N` distinct integers within the specified range. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_4()`, we cannot determine the specific values in the list. Thus, the only change is the reassignment of `p`.

Output State: **`X` is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, `N` is an integer where 0 ≤ N ≤ 100, `p` is a list of `N` distinct integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 100, and `N` is greater than 0.**
