The function `func_4` is part of a heap maintenance algorithm, specifically designed to ensure the heap property is maintained at a given index `i`. It accepts three parameters: `array` (a list of integers), `i` (a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed), and `item_num` (a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that `0 <= i < item_num`). The function does not return a value but modifies the `array` in place.

The function compares the value at the current index `i` with its left and right children (if they exist within the bounds of `item_num`). If either child has a value greater than the value at `i`, the function swaps the value at `i` with the larger of the two children and recursively calls itself on the new index of the swapped value. This process continues until the heap property is restored at the index `i`.

After the function concludes, the `array` is modified such that the subtree rooted at index `i` satisfies the heap property, meaning the parent node is greater than or equal to its children. The values of `i` and `item_num` remain unchanged, and no other side effects are observed.
