#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1
    #The program returns 2 * i + 1, where i is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and returns the value `2 * i + 1`. The function correctly computes the result for any non-negative integer input, including the edge case where `i` is 0. After the function call, the program state includes the returned value, which is always an odd integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer.
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2
    #The program returns a value that is twice the non-negative integer 'i' plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `i`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. It returns a value that is twice the input `i` plus 2. The function does not modify any external state or variables and always returns an integer. If `i` is 0, the function returns 2. For any positive integer `i`, the function returns a value that is two more than twice the input. No edge cases or missing functionality are present in the given code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap.
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
    #The program returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\), where \(i\) is a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `i`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This function effectively computes the index of the parent node of the node at index `i` in a zero-based binary heap. The function assumes that `i` is a valid index (i.e., a positive integer greater than 0). If `i` is 0, the function will return -1, which is not a valid index in a zero-based binary heap. The function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases such as negative integers or non-integer values. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, i is a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed, and item_num is a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that 0 <= i < item_num.
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if (left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]) :
        largest = left
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `left` is less than `item_num` and `array[left]` is greater than `array[i]`, then `largest` is updated to `left`. Otherwise, `largest` remains `i`.
    if (right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]) :
        largest = right
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `right` is less than `item_num` and `array[right]` is greater than `array[largest]`, then `largest` is updated to `right`. Otherwise, `largest` remains `i`.
    if (largest != i) :
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `largest` is not equal to `i`, then `array[i]` is the original value of `array[right]`, `array[largest]` (which is `right`) is the original value of `array[i]`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is the original value of `array[i]`, and `func_4` has been called with parameters `array`, `largest`, and `item_num`. If `largest` is equal to `i`, then `largest` remains `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` is part of a heap maintenance algorithm, specifically designed to ensure the heap property is maintained at a given index `i`. It accepts three parameters: `array` (a list of integers), `i` (a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed), and `item_num` (a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that `0 <= i < item_num`). The function does not return a value but modifies the `array` in place.

The function compares the value at the current index `i` with its left and right children (if they exist within the bounds of `item_num`). If either child has a value greater than the value at `i`, the function swaps the value at `i` with the larger of the two children and recursively calls itself on the new index of the swapped value. This process continues until the heap property is restored at the index `i`.

After the function concludes, the `array` is modified such that the subtree rooted at index `i` satisfies the heap property, meaning the parent node is greater than or equal to its children. The values of `i` and `item_num` remain unchanged, and no other side effects are observed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, array is a list of integers with length equal to size, and the elements in array are the initial values of the heap nodes.
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `size` is the integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0 if `func_3(size)` is greater than 0; otherwise, `array` remains unchanged and `func_4` has not been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `size` from the standard input, which represents the number of elements in the heap. It then reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converting them into a list `array` of length `size`. The function modifies `array` in place to represent a valid heap structure by calling `func_4` for each index from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0, assuming `func_3(size)` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_3(size)` returns 0, `array` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `array` is a list of integers that forms a valid heap structure, and `size` is the integer value read from the standard input. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `size` is 0 or 1, in which case `array` will either be empty or a single-element list, respectively, both of which are trivially valid heaps.
