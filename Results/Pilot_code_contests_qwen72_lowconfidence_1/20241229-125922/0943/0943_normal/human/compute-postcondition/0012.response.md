The code snippet `array[largest] = tmp` updates the element at the index `largest` in the `array` with the value of `tmp`. Given that `tmp` is initially set to `array[i]`, this means that the value at `array[i]` (before the current operation) is moved to `array[largest]`.

Let's summarize the changes and the state of the variables:

- `array[largest]` is now set to `tmp`, which is the original value of `array[i]`.
- `array[i]` is now the value that was originally at `array[right]` (since `largest` is `right`).

Therefore, the elements at indices `i` and `largest` (which is `right`) in the `array` have effectively swapped their values.

The other variables (`i`, `item_num`, `left`, `right`, `largest`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where `array[i]` is the original value of `array[right]` and `array[largest]` (which is `right`) is the original value of `array[i]`, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is the original value of `array[i]`.**
