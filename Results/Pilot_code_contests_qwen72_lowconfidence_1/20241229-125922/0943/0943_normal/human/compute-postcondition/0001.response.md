The provided code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `array`.

- The initial state specifies that `size` is an integer value read from the standard input, and `array` is a list of integers with a length equal to the original `size`.
- After executing the code, `array` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input line. The length of this new `array` will match the number of space-separated integers provided in the input, which should ideally match the `size` as per the initial state.
- The `size` variable remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `array` and the unchanged `size`.

Output State: **`size` is the integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, and the elements in `array` are the converted integers from the input.**
