To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is in the range from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.

2. **Current State**:
   - `size` is an integer value read from the standard input.
   - `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line.
   - `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `func_3(size) - 2`.
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be `func_3(size) - 3`.

4. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_3(size) - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies `func_3(size)` must be greater than 3.

Given this analysis, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `func_3(size) - 3`.
- `func_3(size)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 3, `i` is `func_3(size) - 3`, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.**
