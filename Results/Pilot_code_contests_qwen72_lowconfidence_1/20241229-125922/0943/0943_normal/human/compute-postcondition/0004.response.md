To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `size` is an integer value read from the standard input.
- `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line.
- `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `func_3(size) - 1`.
- `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`. This means the loop starts with `i` set to `func_3(size) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches 0.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `func_3(size) - 1`.
   - `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0.
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Updated State:
- `i` is `func_3(size) - 2` (since `i` was `func_3(size) - 1` and it is decremented by 1).
- `func_3(size)` must still be greater than 0.
- `func_4(array, i, size)` will be called again with the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0, `i` is `func_3(size) - 2`, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.**
