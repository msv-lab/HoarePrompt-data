The function `func_5` does not seem to be correctly defined based on the provided parameter constraints. The function signature should include the parameters `size` and `array` as described. Assuming this is a typo and the correct function signature is:

```python
def func_5(size, array):
```

Given the parameter constraints and relationships:
- `size` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap.
- `array` is a list of integers with a length equal to `size`.
- The elements in `array` are the initial values of the heap nodes.

Since the output description is missing, I'll assume that the function returns a modified version of `array` where it represents a valid heap structure (e.g., a max-heap or min-heap).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `size`, a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, and `array`, a list of integers with a length equal to `size`. It returns a modified version of `array` that represents a valid heap structure.**
