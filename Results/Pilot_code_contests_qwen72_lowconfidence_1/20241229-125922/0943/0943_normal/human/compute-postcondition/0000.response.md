The value of `size` is updated to the integer value read from the standard input, which is expected to be a positive integer. The array remains unchanged as a list of integers with a length equal to the original value of `size`. The elements in the array are still the initial values of the heap nodes.

Output State: **`size` is the integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the original `size`, and the elements in `array` are the initial values of the heap nodes.**
