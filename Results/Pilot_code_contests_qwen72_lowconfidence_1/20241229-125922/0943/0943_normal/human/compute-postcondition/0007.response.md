The provided code snippet calls the function `func_4(array, i, size)`. Since this function call does not include any explicit return value or modification of the global variables within the given context, the values of `size`, `array`, `i`, and the conditions related to `func_3(size)` and the call to `func_4(array, i, size)` remain unchanged.

However, without the definition of `func_4`, it's impossible to determine if `func_4` modifies any of its parameters or returns a value. Based on the information provided, we assume that `func_4` does not modify its parameters or return a value.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 3, `i` is `func_3(size) - 3`, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.**
