Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `size` from the standard input, which represents the number of elements in the heap. It then reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converting them into a list `array` of length `size`. The function modifies `array` in place to represent a valid heap structure by calling `func_4` for each index from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0, assuming `func_3(size)` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_3(size)` returns 0, `array` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `array` is a list of integers that forms a valid heap structure, and `size` is the integer value read from the standard input. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `size` is 0 or 1, in which case `array` will either be empty or a single-element list, respectively, both of which are trivially valid heaps. **
