The code snippet `array[i] = array[largest]` updates the value at index `i` in the `array` to be the same as the value at index `largest`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `item_num`, `left`, `right`, or `tmp`.

- `array[i]` was originally `tmp`.
- After the assignment, `array[i]` is now `array[largest]`.
- The value of `largest` is either `i` or `right`, depending on the conditions specified in the initial state.

Since `largest` is different from `i`, `largest` must be `right`. Therefore, `array[i]` is now `array[right]`.

The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the updated value of `array[i]`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is `array[i]` (which was originally `array[i]`), `array[i]` is now `array[right]`.**
