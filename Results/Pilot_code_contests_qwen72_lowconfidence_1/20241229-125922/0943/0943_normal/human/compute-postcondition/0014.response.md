Postcondition: ***`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `largest` is not equal to `i`, then `array[i]` is the original value of `array[right]`, `array[largest]` (which is `right`) is the original value of `array[i]`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is the original value of `array[i]`, and `func_4` has been called with parameters `array`, `largest`, and `item_num`. If `largest` is equal to `i`, then `largest` remains `i`.***
