To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the `for` loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Function**: The `range(0, func_3(size))` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `func_3(size)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0.

2. **Reversed Function**: The `reversed` function reverses the sequence generated by `range(0, func_3(size))`. This means the loop will iterate from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `size` is an integer value read from the standard input.
   - `array` is a list of integers with a length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, and the elements in `array` are the converted integers from the input.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute if `func_3(size)` returns a value greater than 0. Therefore, `size` must be such that `func_3(size)` is positive.

### Adjusted State:
- `size` must be such that `func_3(size) > 0`.
- `i` is initially set to `func_3(size) - 1` (the first value in the reversed range).

### Final State:
State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0, `i` is `func_3(size) - 1`**.
