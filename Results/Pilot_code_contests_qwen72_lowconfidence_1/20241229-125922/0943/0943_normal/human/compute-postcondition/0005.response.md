The code snippet `func_4(array, i, size)` calls a function named `func_4` with the arguments `array`, `i`, and `size`. Since the specifics of what `func_4` does are not provided, we can only infer that this call might modify one or more of the passed arguments (`array`, `i`, `size`). However, without knowing the implementation details of `func_4`, we cannot determine exactly how these variables are modified.

Given that `func_4(array, i, size)` has already been called as part of the initial state, executing this line again would imply a redundant function call, unless `func_4` has side effects (e.g., modifies global variables or external resources).

Since no changes to the variables can be definitively determined, and assuming `func_4` does not return a value or modify its arguments in a way that affects the state outside of its scope, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0, `i` is `func_3(size) - 2`, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.**
