The function `func_4(array, largest, item_num)` is called with the parameters `array`, `largest`, and `item_num`. The exact behavior of `func_4` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific impact on the variables. However, since the function is called, it implies that the function will execute and potentially modify the state.

Given the initial state, the variables `array`, `largest`, and `item_num` are passed to `func_4`. After the function call, the state of these variables might change depending on what `func_4` does. Since the specifics of `func_4` are not given, we can only assume that the function might modify `array` or `largest`, or it might return a value.

However, without knowing the implementation of `func_4`, we cannot determine the exact changes. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the function has been called but the exact changes to the variables are unknown.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers where `array[i]` is the original value of `array[right]` and `array[largest]` (which is `right`) is the original value of `array[i]`, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is the original value of `array[i]`, `func_4` has been called with parameters `array`, `largest`, and `item_num`.**
