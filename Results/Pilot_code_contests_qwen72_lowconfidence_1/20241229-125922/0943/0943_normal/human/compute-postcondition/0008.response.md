To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it operates. The loop iterates over a range generated by `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`. This means the loop will start from `func_3(size) - 1` and decrement down to 0, calling `func_4(array, i, size)` for each iteration.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `size` is an integer value read from the standard input.
   - `array` is a list of integers with a length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `func_3(size)` iterations, starting from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.
   - For each iteration, `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with `i` being the current index.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute at least once if `func_3(size)` is greater than 0.
   - If `func_3(size)` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will have iterated from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0.
   - `func_4(array, i, size)` will have been called for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.
   - The state of `array` will depend on the operations performed by `func_4`.

### Final Output State:
- **If `func_3(size)` is greater than 0**:
  - `size` remains the same as the integer value read from the standard input.
  - `array` will have been modified by `func_4` for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.
  - `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0.

- **If `func_3(size)` is 0 or negative**:
  - `size` remains the same as the integer value read from the standard input.
  - `array` remains unchanged.
  - `func_4(array, i, size)` has not been called.

### Output State:
Output State: **`size` is the integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0 if `func_3(size)` is greater than 0; otherwise, `array` remains unchanged and `func_4` has not been called.**
