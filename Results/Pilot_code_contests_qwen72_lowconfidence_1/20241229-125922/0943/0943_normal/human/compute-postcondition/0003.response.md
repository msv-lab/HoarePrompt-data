The function `func_4(array, i, size)` is called with the arguments `array`, `i`, and `size`. Since the implementation of `func_4` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables or the state of the program. However, we know that the function is called with the current values of `array`, `i`, and `size`.

Given that `func_3(size)` returns a value greater than 0, and `i` is set to `func_3(size) - 1`, `i` must be a non-negative integer.

Since the function `func_4` is called, it may modify `array`, `i`, or `size`, or it may perform operations and return a value. Without knowing the implementation of `func_4`, we cannot specify the exact changes to the state. However, we can assume that the call to `func_4` does not alter the precondition unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Output State: **`size` is an integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_3(size)` must be greater than 0, `i` is `func_3(size) - 1`, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called.**
