The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `array`, `i`, and `item_num`. `array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed, and `item_num` is a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that 0 <= i < item_num. The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot definitively state what it returns. However, based on the parameters and their relationships, we can infer that the function likely processes elements in the array based on the index `i` and the total number of items `item_num`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array`, a non-negative integer `i` representing the index of the current node being processed, and a positive integer `item_num` representing the number of items in the heap such that 0 <= i < item_num. The specific return value or action of the function is not provided.**
