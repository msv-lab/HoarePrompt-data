Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it constructs the max-heap. Specifically, the function `func_5` is not correctly building the max-heap because it does not handle the input array properly. The array is read using `map`, but it is not converted to a list, which means it is an iterator. This causes issues when trying to access elements by index later in the `func_4` function.

Additionally, the `func_5` function should print the final heap after constructing it, but it currently does not do this. To fix these issues, the array should be converted to a list, and the final heap should be printed. Here is the corrected version of the relevant parts:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1

# Function 2:
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2

# Function 3:
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)

# Function 4:
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)

# Function 5:
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))  # Convert to list
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
    for val in array:
        print(f" {val}", end="")
    print()

# Call the function to test
func_5()
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly construct the max-heap and print the values as required. However, since the original program did not handle these cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
