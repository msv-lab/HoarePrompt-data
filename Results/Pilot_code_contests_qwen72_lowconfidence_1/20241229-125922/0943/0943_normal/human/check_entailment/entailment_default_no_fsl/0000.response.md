Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_5` is intended to build a max-heap from the input array, but there is a logical error in the range used for the loop. Specifically, the loop iterates over `reversed(range(0, func_3(size)))`, which means it starts from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0. However, `func_3(size)` computes the parent index of the last node, which is not necessarily the correct starting point for building the max-heap.

According to the problem description, the correct starting point for the loop should be `size // 2 - 1` (or equivalently `func_3(size) + 1` if `func_3` returns the parent index of the last node). This is because the last node's parent is the last non-leaf node in the heap, and we need to start from this node and move upwards to ensure the heap property is maintained.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
10
4 1 3 2 16 9 10 14 8 7
```

The expected output is:
```
16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1
```

However, due to the incorrect loop range, the program may not correctly build the max-heap, leading to an incorrect output. For instance, if the loop starts from an incorrect index, the heap may not be fully constructed, and the output could be:
```
16 14 10 8 7 9 3 2 4 1  # Incorrectly built heap
```

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
