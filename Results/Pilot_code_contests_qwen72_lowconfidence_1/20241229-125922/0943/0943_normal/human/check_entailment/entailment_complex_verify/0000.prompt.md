You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary heap which satisfies max-heap property is called max-heap. In a max-heap, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[i] \leq A[parent(i)]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.

Here is an example of a max-heap.

<image>


Write a program which reads an array and constructs a max-heap from the array based on the following pseudo code.

$maxHeapify(A, i)$ move the value of $A[i]$ down to leaves to make a sub-tree of node $i$ a max-heap. Here, $H$ is the size of the heap.


1  maxHeapify(A, i)
2      l = left(i)
3      r = right(i)
4      // select the node which has the maximum value
5      if l ≤ H and A[l] > A[i]
6          largest = l
7      else
8          largest = i
9      if r ≤ H and A[r] > A[largest]
10         largest = r
11
12     if largest ≠ i　// value of children is larger than that of i
13         swap A[i] and A[largest]
14         maxHeapify(A, largest) // call recursively


The following procedure buildMaxHeap(A) makes $A$ a max-heap by performing maxHeapify in a bottom-up manner.


1 buildMaxHeap(A)
2    for i = H/2 downto 1
3        maxHeapify(A, i)




Input

In the first line, an integer $H$ is given. In the second line, $H$ integers which represent elements in the binary heap are given in order of node id (from $1$ to $H$).

Output

Print values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id (from $1$ to $H$). Print a single space character before each value.

```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it constructs the max-heap. Specifically, the function `func_5` is not correctly building the max-heap because it does not handle the input array properly. The array is read using `map`, but it is not converted to a list, which means it is an iterator. This causes issues when trying to access elements by index later in the `func_4` function.

Additionally, the `func_5` function should print the final heap after constructing it, but it currently does not do this. To fix these issues, the array should be converted to a list, and the final heap should be printed. Here is the corrected version of the relevant parts:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1

# Function 2:
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2

# Function 3:
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)

# Function 4:
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)

# Function 5:
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))  # Convert to list
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
    for val in array:
        print(f" {val}", end="")
    print()

# Call the function to test
func_5()
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly construct the max-heap and print the values as required. However, since the original program did not handle these cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1
    #The program returns 2 * i + 1, where i is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and returns the value `2 * i + 1`. The function correctly computes the result for any non-negative integer input, including the edge case where `i` is 0. After the function call, the program state includes the returned value, which is always an odd integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer.
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2
    #The program returns a value that is twice the non-negative integer 'i' plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `i`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. It returns a value that is twice the input `i` plus 2. The function does not modify any external state or variables and always returns an integer. If `i` is 0, the function returns 2. For any positive integer `i`, the function returns a value that is two more than twice the input. No edge cases or missing functionality are present in the given code.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap.
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
    #The program returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\), where \(i\) is a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `i`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This function effectively computes the index of the parent node of the node at index `i` in a zero-based binary heap. The function assumes that `i` is a valid index (i.e., a positive integer greater than 0). If `i` is 0, the function will return -1, which is not a valid index in a zero-based binary heap. The function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases such as negative integers or non-integer values. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, i is a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed, and item_num is a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that 0 <= i < item_num.
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if (left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]) :
        largest = left
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `left` is less than `item_num` and `array[left]` is greater than `array[i]`, then `largest` is updated to `left`. Otherwise, `largest` remains `i`.
    if (right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]) :
        largest = right
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `right` is less than `item_num` and `array[right]` is greater than `array[largest]`, then `largest` is updated to `right`. Otherwise, `largest` remains `i`.
    if (largest != i) :
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`array` is a list of integers, `i` is a non-negative integer, `item_num` is a positive integer such that `0 <= i < item_num`, `left` is the value returned by `func_1(i)`, `right` is the value returned by `func_2(i)`. If `largest` is not equal to `i`, then `array[i]` is the original value of `array[right]`, `array[largest]` (which is `right`) is the original value of `array[i]`, `largest` is `right`, `tmp` is the original value of `array[i]`, and `func_4` has been called with parameters `array`, `largest`, and `item_num`. If `largest` is equal to `i`, then `largest` remains `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` is part of a heap maintenance algorithm, specifically designed to ensure the heap property is maintained at a given index `i`. It accepts three parameters: `array` (a list of integers), `i` (a non-negative integer representing the index of the current node being processed), and `item_num` (a positive integer representing the number of items in the heap such that `0 <= i < item_num`). The function does not return a value but modifies the `array` in place.

The function compares the value at the current index `i` with its left and right children (if they exist within the bounds of `item_num`). If either child has a value greater than the value at `i`, the function swaps the value at `i` with the larger of the two children and recursively calls itself on the new index of the swapped value. This process continues until the heap property is restored at the index `i`.

After the function concludes, the `array` is modified such that the subtree rooted at index `i` satisfies the heap property, meaning the parent node is greater than or equal to its children. The values of `i` and `item_num` remain unchanged, and no other side effects are observed.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: size is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the heap, array is a list of integers with length equal to size, and the elements in array are the initial values of the heap nodes.
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `size` is the integer value read from the standard input, `array` is a list of integers with length equal to the number of space-separated integers provided in the input line, `func_4(array, i, size)` has been called for each `i` from `func_3(size) - 1` to 0 if `func_3(size)` is greater than 0; otherwise, `array` remains unchanged and `func_4` has not been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer `size` from the standard input, which represents the number of elements in the heap. It then reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converting them into a list `array` of length `size`. The function modifies `array` in place to represent a valid heap structure by calling `func_4` for each index from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0, assuming `func_3(size)` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_3(size)` returns 0, `array` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `array` is a list of integers that forms a valid heap structure, and `size` is the integer value read from the standard input. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `size` is 0 or 1, in which case `array` will either be empty or a single-element list, respectively, both of which are trivially valid heaps.
