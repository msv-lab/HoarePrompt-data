Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The key issues identified in the original assessment are still valid:

1. **Handling of Input Array**: The original assessment correctly pointed out that the array is read using `map`, but it is not converted to a list. This means that `array` is an iterator, and accessing elements by index later in the `func_4` function will not work as expected. The annotated version confirms this issue:
   ```python
   array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
   ```
   This should be:
   ```python
   array = list(map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
   ```

2. **Printing the Final Heap**: The original assessment also correctly noted that the function `func_5` does not print the final heap after constructing it. The annotated version does not show any printing of the final heap, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The correct implementation should include:
   ```python
   for val in array:
       print(f" {val}", end="")
   print()
   ```

These issues are critical to the program's correctness as per the problem description. The program must correctly handle the input array and print the final heap. Since the original program does not do this, the assessment of **False** is accurate.
