Final: **False**

Reasoning:

The original assessment identified a critical issue in the program: the `map` object returned by the `map` function is not being converted to a list. This means that when `func_4` attempts to access elements in `array`, it will not work as expected because `array` is an iterator, not a list. This would lead to incorrect heap operations and ultimately produce the wrong output.

Let's break down the key points from the annotations and the original assessment:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the line:
     ```python
     array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
     ```
   - The `map` function returns an iterator, which is not directly indexable. Converting it to a list ensures that `array` is a proper list of integers, allowing the heap operations to proceed correctly.

2. **Function Annotations:**
   - The annotations for `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correct and do not indicate any issues.
   - The annotation for `func_4` correctly describes its behavior and confirms that it performs the necessary heap maintenance operations.
   - The annotation for `func_5` correctly describes the overall flow of the function, but it does not address the issue with the `map` object.

3. **Program Behavior:**
   - Without converting the `map` object to a list, the program will fail to correctly access and manipulate the elements of `array` during the heap construction process.
   - This would lead to incorrect heap formation and, consequently, incorrect output.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the input correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct as per the problem description.
