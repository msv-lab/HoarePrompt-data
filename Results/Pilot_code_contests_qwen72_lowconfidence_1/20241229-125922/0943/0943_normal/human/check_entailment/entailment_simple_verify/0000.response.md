Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Iterator Issue**: The annotated version confirms that `array` is initialized using `map` without converting it to a list. This means `array` is an iterator, and accessing elements by index will not work as expected. The annotation states:
   ```
   array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
   ```
   This is a critical issue because the `func_4` function relies on indexing the `array`, which will fail if `array` is an iterator.

2. **Missing Output**: The annotated version does not include any output statements in `func_5` to print the final heap. The annotation for `func_5` ends with:
   ```
   for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
       func_4(array, i, size)
   ```
   There is no indication that the final heap is printed, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

3. **Logical Flow**: The annotations confirm that the program attempts to build a max-heap by calling `func_4` in a bottom-up manner, but the issues with the iterator and missing output mean that the program does not fully meet the problem requirements.

Given these points, the original assessment of **False** is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the input array and does not print the final heap, both of which are necessary to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
