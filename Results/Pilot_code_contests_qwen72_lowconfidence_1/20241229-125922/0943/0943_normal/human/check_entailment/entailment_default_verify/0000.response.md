Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. Specifically:

1. **Array Conversion**: The array is read using `map` but not converted to a list. This means that `array` is an iterator, and attempting to access elements by index later in the `func_4` function will result in errors or unexpected behavior.

2. **Printing the Result**: The `func_5` function does not print the final heap after constructing it. According to the problem description, the program should print the values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id.

3. **Edge Cases**: The output hints mention potential edge cases such as `size` being 0 or 1. While these cases are trivially valid heaps, the program should still handle them correctly. The current implementation does not ensure that the final heap is printed, which is a requirement of the problem description.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, particularly in handling the input array correctly and printing the final heap. Therefore, the final correctness of the program is **False**.
