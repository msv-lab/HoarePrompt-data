You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A binary heap which satisfies max-heap property is called max-heap. In a max-heap, for every node $i$ other than the root, $A[i] \leq A[parent(i)]$, that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent. The largest element in a max-heap is stored at the root, and the subtree rooted at a node contains values no larger than that contained at the node itself.

Here is an example of a max-heap.

<image>


Write a program which reads an array and constructs a max-heap from the array based on the following pseudo code.

$maxHeapify(A, i)$ move the value of $A[i]$ down to leaves to make a sub-tree of node $i$ a max-heap. Here, $H$ is the size of the heap.


1  maxHeapify(A, i)
2      l = left(i)
3      r = right(i)
4      // select the node which has the maximum value
5      if l ≤ H and A[l] > A[i]
6          largest = l
7      else
8          largest = i
9      if r ≤ H and A[r] > A[largest]
10         largest = r
11
12     if largest ≠ i　// value of children is larger than that of i
13         swap A[i] and A[largest]
14         maxHeapify(A, largest) // call recursively


The following procedure buildMaxHeap(A) makes $A$ a max-heap by performing maxHeapify in a bottom-up manner.


1 buildMaxHeap(A)
2    for i = H/2 downto 1
3        maxHeapify(A, i)




Input

In the first line, an integer $H$ is given. In the second line, $H$ integers which represent elements in the binary heap are given in order of node id (from $1$ to $H$).

Output

Print values of nodes in the max-heap in order of their id (from $1$ to $H$). Print a single space character before each value.

    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left

        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = map(lambda x: int(x), sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' '))
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it constructs the max-heap. Specifically, the function `func_5` is not correctly building the max-heap because it does not handle the input array properly. The array is read using `map`, but it is not converted to a list, which means it is an iterator. This causes issues when trying to access elements by index later in the `func_4` function.

Additionally, the `func_5` function should print the final heap after constructing it, but it currently does not do this. To fix these issues, the array should be converted to a list, and the final heap should be printed. Here is the corrected version of the relevant parts:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1(i):
    return 2 * i + 1

# Function 2:
def func_2(i):
    return 2 * i + 2

# Function 3:
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)

# Function 4:
def func_4(array, i, item_num):
    left = func_1(i)
    right = func_2(i)
    largest = i
    if left < item_num and array[left] > array[largest]:
        largest = left
    if right < item_num and array[right] > array[largest]:
        largest = right
    if largest != i:
        tmp = array[i]
        array[i] = array[largest]
        array[largest] = tmp
        func_4(array, largest, item_num)

# Function 5:
def func_5():
    size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))  # Convert to list
    for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
        func_4(array, i, size)
    for val in array:
        print(f" {val}", end="")
    print()

# Call the function to test
func_5()
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly construct the max-heap and print the values as required. However, since the original program did not handle these cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 5 : The function reads a positive integer `size` from the standard input, which represents the number of elements in the heap. It then reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converting them into a list `array` of length `size`. The function modifies `array` in place to represent a valid heap structure by calling `func_4` for each index from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0, assuming `func_3(size)` returns a non-negative integer. If `func_3(size)` returns 0, `array` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `array` is a list of integers that forms a valid heap structure, and `size` is the integer value read from the standard input. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `size` is 0 or 1, in which case `array` will either be empty or a single-element list, respectively, both of which are trivially valid heaps.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
