Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description, particularly in how it handles the construction of the max-heap. Specifically, the issue lies in the range used in the `for` loop in `func_5`:

```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
```

This loop iterates from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0. However, according to the problem description, the `buildMaxHeap` function should start from `H/2` (or `H // 2` in Python) and go down to 1. The correct loop should be:

```python
for i in reversed(range(func_3(size) + 1)):
```

This ensures that the loop starts from the last non-leaf node (which is `H // 2`) and goes down to the root (index 0 in zero-based indexing).

Additionally, the function `func_3` should return the correct parent index for a zero-based array. The current implementation of `func_3` is:

```python
def func_3(i):
    return int((i - 1) / 2)
```

This function is correct for a zero-based array, but the loop in `func_5` should start from `func_3(size) + 1` to include the correct range of indices.

To summarize, the current implementation does not correctly handle the range of indices for building the max-heap, leading to potential incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
