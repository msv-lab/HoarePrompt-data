Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly due to an issue in reading the array. Specifically, the array is not being read into a list properly, which leads to issues when trying to manipulate the heap. The `map` function returns an iterator, and it should be converted to a list before being used in the heap operations. Here's the corrected part of the program:

```python
size = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
array = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
```

Without converting the `map` object to a list, the array will not be accessible as expected in the subsequent heap operations, leading to incorrect results. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
