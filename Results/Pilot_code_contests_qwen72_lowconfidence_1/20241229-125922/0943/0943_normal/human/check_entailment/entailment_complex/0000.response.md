Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when the size of the heap is 1. According to the problem description, a heap with a single element is already a valid max-heap. However, the function `func_5` calls `func_4` for indices from `func_3(size) - 1` down to 0, which means it will attempt to call `func_4` even when `size` is 1. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior.

Specifically, when `size` is 1:
- `func_3(size)` returns `0` because `int((1 - 1) / 2) = 0`.
- The `for` loop in `func_5` will attempt to iterate from `0 - 1` down to 0, which is an invalid range and will not execute the loop body. However, this is still a logical issue because the loop should not be attempted at all for a heap of size 1.

To fix this, the loop in `func_5` should only run if `func_3(size)` is greater than 0. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
for i in reversed(range(0, func_3(size))):
    if i >= 0:
        func_4(array, i, size)
```

However, since the original code does not handle this edge case correctly, the program is considered incorrect.
