The function `func_3` accepts a single parameter `i`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing a node index in a binary heap. It returns the integer value of \((i - 1) / 2\). This function effectively computes the index of the parent node of the node at index `i` in a zero-based binary heap. The function assumes that `i` is a valid index (i.e., a positive integer greater than 0). If `i` is 0, the function will return -1, which is not a valid index in a zero-based binary heap. The function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases such as negative integers or non-integer values. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.
