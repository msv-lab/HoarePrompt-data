Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function reads and processes the input. The function uses `input()` and `raw_input()` which are not compatible with Python 3, where `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. This means that in Python 3, the function will not read the input correctly, leading to potential errors or incorrect behavior.

Additionally, the function assumes that the number of data sets `t` is an integer, but it does not convert the input to an integer before using it in the loop. This can lead to a TypeError if the input is not explicitly converted to an integer.

Here is a corrected version of the code that should work correctly in Python 3:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        print(sm)
```

This version ensures that the input is correctly read and processed, and it handles the problem description accurately for every potential case.
