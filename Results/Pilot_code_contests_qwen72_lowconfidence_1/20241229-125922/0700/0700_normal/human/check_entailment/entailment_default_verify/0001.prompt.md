You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.

        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        print(sm)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days `n` and the list of prices `l`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `minAr` to the last element of the list `l`, which represents the minimum price seen so far from the end.
   - It initializes `sm` to 0, which will count the number of days with a bad price.
   - It iterates over the list `l` from the second-to-last element to the first element (i.e., in reverse order).
   - For each element `l[j]`:
     - If `l[j]` is less than `minAr`, it updates `minAr` to `l[j]`.
     - If `l[j]` is greater than `minAr`, it increments `sm` by 1, indicating that the price on day `j` is a bad price.
   - After processing all elements, it prints the value of `sm`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as there are no future days to compare against.
   - It also handles cases where the prices are in non-decreasing order, where the output should be 0.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The program processes each test case in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` processes multiple data sets, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each data set, it calculates the number of elements in the list that are strictly greater than the minimum value found from the last element to the first. The result, `sm`, is printed for each data set. If a list has fewer than 2 elements, the function prints 0 for that data set. The function reads inputs from standard input and does not return any values. After the function completes, the state of the program includes the processed data sets and the printed results, but the original input values (`t`, `n`, and `l`) are no longer accessible.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
