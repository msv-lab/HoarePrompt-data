Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are Python 2 functions. In Python 3, `input()` should be used for all user inputs, and `raw_input()` is not available. This could lead to runtime errors if the program is run in Python 3.

2. **Loop Initialization**: The loop `for i in range(input()):` is incorrect because `input()` returns a string, and `range()` expects an integer. It should be `for i in range(int(input())):` to convert the input to an integer.

3. **Logic for Counting Bad Prices**: The logic for counting bad prices is almost correct but has a minor issue. The program initializes `minAr` to the last element of the list `l` and then iterates backward from the second last element to the first. However, it should initialize `minAr` to a very large value (or use the last element as the initial minimum) and start the comparison from the second last element to avoid missing the last element's comparison.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
        
        minAr = float('inf')
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            else:
                sm += 1
        
        print(sm)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: `t = int(input())` and `n = int(input())` correctly read the number of test cases and the number of days, respectively.
2. **List Initialization**: `l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]` correctly reads the list of prices.
3. **Initialization of `minAr`**: `minAr = float('inf')` initializes `minAr` to infinity to ensure the first comparison is valid.
4. **Backward Iteration**: The loop `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):` iterates backward through the list, updating `minAr` and counting the number of bad prices.

With these corrections, the program will correctly count the number of days with bad prices for each test case, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
