You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, representing the number of data sets. Each data set contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The sum of n over all data sets does not exceed 150000.
def func():
    for i in range(input()):
        n = input()
        
        l = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split(' ')]
        
        minAr = l[-1]
        
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        
        print(sm)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000), `l` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `minAr` is the minimum value in the list `l` starting from the second last element to the first element (inclusive), `sm` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr`, and the value of `sm` is printed for each of the `t` data sets. If any list `l` has fewer than 2 elements, `minAr` remains the last element of `l`, while `sm` remains 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
