Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `input()` to read the number of test cases `t`, which is correct.
   - However, inside the loop, it uses `input()` again to read the integer `n` and `raw_input().split(' ')` to read the list of prices. This is incorrect because in Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`. The correct way to read the list of prices is:
     ```python
     l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
     ```

2. **Initialization of `minAr`:**
   - The program initializes `minAr` as the last element of the list `l`. This is correct because it starts comparing from the end of the list.

3. **Counting Bad Prices:**
   - The program iterates through the list from the second last element to the first element. It updates `minAr` to the minimum value encountered so far and increments `sm` if the current price is greater than `minAr`. This logic is correct for counting the number of bad prices.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of bad prices for each test case, which is correct.

However, due to the use of `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, the program will fail in Python 3 environments. This is a significant issue because the problem description specifies that the program should work correctly for all valid inputs, and using the wrong function for reading input will cause the program to fail.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
        
        minAr = l[-1]
        
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        
        print(sm)
```

### Why the Corrected Program is Correct:
- **Input Handling:** The corrected program uses `input()` to read both the number of test cases and the list of prices, which is consistent with Python 3.
- **Logic for Counting Bad Prices:** The logic for counting bad prices is correct and matches the problem description.
- **Output:** The program prints the correct number of bad prices for each test case.

Thus, the corrected program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
