Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function returns a string, but the program treats it as an integer directly. This will cause a TypeError. It should be converted to an integer using `int()`.

2. **Raw Input Function**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause a NameError in Python 3.

3. **Logic for Bad Prices**: The logic to determine the number of bad prices seems correct, but the overall structure and input handling need to be fixed.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Number of days
        l = [int(j) for j in input().split()]  # Prices for each day
        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        results.append(sm)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version handles the input properly and should work for all potential cases as described in the problem.
