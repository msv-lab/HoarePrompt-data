You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for n last days: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price of berPhone on the day i.

Polycarp considers the price on the day i to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if n=6 and a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5], then the number of days with a bad price is 3 — these are days 2 (a_2=9), 4 (a_4=6) and 5 (a_5=7).

Print the number of days with a bad price.

You have to answer t independent data sets.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.

Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of days. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), where a_i is the price on the i-th day.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all data sets in the test does not exceed 150000.

Output

Print t integers, the j-th of which should be equal to the number of days with a bad price in the j-th input data set.

Program:
```
def func():
    for i in range(input()):
        n = input()
        l = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split(' ')]
        minAr = l[-1]
        sm = 0
        for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
            if l[j] < minAr:
                minAr = l[j]
            elif l[j] > minAr:
                sm += 1
        print(sm)


```
Output hints: The function `func` processes multiple data sets, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each data set, it calculates the number of elements in the list that are strictly greater than the minimum value found from the last element to the first. The result, `sm`, is printed for each data set. If a list has fewer than 2 elements, the function prints 0 for that data set. The function reads inputs from standard input and does not return any values. After the function completes, the state of the program includes the processed data sets and the printed results, but the original input values (`t`, `n`, and `l`) are no longer accessible.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
