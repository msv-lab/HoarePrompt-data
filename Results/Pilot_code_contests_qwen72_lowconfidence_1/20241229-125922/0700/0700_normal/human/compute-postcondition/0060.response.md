The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 1, and the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `minAr`. Additionally, the current value of `l[j]` is greater than `minAr`.**
