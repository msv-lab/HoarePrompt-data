The value of `n` is assigned the value returned by `input()`, which according to the initial state must be equal to `t`. Therefore, `n` is now equal to `t`. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`**
