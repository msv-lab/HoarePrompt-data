Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and the last element of `l` (i.e., `l[j]`) is not less than `minAr`. If `l[j]` is greater than `minAr`, `sm` is set to 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains 0.***
