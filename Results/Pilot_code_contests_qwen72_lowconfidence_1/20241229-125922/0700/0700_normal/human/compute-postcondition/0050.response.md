To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input string.
- `j` is -1.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `minAr` is the minimum value in `l`.
- `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(input()):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `input()`. The `input()` function is called each time the loop starts, so the range can change with each iteration.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and the new range must still include this value of `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- **Input Range**: The `input()` function will be called again to determine the new range. For the loop to execute again, the new input must be at least 2 (since `i` will be 2).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`, the new input must be at least 2.**
