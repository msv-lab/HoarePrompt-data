To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input string.
- `j` is -1.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements.
- `minAr` is the last element of `l`.
- `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1)`. This means `j` starts at `len(l) - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1 (exclusive).

2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is -1.
   - `l` has at least 3 elements.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1)`.
   - The next value of `j` would be `len(l) - 3`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to `len(l) - 3`.
   - The list `l` must have at least 4 elements for `j` to be `len(l) - 3` and still be within the valid range.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` remains the same: 2.
- `n` remains the same: a new input string.
- `j` is now `len(l) - 3`.
- `l` must have at least 4 elements.
- `minAr` is still the last element of `l`.
- `sm` remains the same: 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 3`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.**
