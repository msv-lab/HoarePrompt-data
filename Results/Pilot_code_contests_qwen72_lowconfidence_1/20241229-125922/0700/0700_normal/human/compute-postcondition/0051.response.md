The value of `n` is updated to the new input string provided by the user. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `minAr`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`**.
