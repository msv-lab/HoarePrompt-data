Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 5 elements, `j` is `len(l) - 4`. If `l[j]` > `minAr`, then `sm` is incremented by 1 and `minAr` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `sm` remains 0 and `minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]` if `l[j]` < `minAr`, or remains unchanged if `l[j]` == `minAr`.***
