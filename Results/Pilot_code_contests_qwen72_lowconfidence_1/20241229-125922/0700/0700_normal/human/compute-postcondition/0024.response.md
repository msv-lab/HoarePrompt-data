The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print(sm)
```

This code prints the value of the variable `sm`. Since `sm` was already computed as part of the preconditions (it is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr` from the second last element to the first element, inclusive), this operation does not change the state of any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sm` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is -1, `minAr` is the minimum value found in the list `l` starting from the second last element to the first element (inclusive), `sm` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr` from the second last element to the first element (inclusive), and the value of `sm` is printed.**
