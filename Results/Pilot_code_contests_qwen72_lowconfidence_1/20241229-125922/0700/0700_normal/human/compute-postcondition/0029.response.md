The code snippet sets `sm` to 0. This updates the value of `sm` which was previously stated as no longer valid based on the new list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 0**
