The code snippet updates the value of `minAr` to `l[j]`. The initial state indicates that `minAr` was not explicitly defined before this operation, so its value was undefined or some initial value that is not specified. After the execution of the code, `minAr` is now equal to `l[j]`.

Since the code only updates `minAr`, the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The value of `sm` is also not affected by this code snippet, so it remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is `len(l) - 3`, `minAr` is `l[j]`, `sm` is 0**.
