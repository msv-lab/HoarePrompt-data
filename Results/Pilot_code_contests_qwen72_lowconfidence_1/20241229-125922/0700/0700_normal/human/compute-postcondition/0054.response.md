The code snippet `sm = 0` sets the variable `sm` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the count of elements in the original `l` that are greater than the minimum value in the original `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 0**
