Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is `len(l) - 2`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, and `minAr` is the last element of `l`. If `l[j]` (the second-to-last element of `l`) is less than `minAr`, `sm` remains 0. If `l[j]` is greater than or equal to `minAr`, `sm` is set to 1.***
