The value of `sm` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 1, and the last element of `l` (i.e., `l[j]`) is greater than `minAr`.**
