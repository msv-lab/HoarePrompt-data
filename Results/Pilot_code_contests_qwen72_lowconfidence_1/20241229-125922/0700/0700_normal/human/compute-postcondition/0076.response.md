The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but is expected to process multiple data sets. Each data set includes an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) and a list of `n` integers (each integer `a_i` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The total number of data sets `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, and the sum of all `n` values across the data sets does not exceed 150000.

The function processes each data set and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output or the nature of the processing is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple data sets, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns a result for each data set.**
