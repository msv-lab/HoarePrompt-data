The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `sm` is determined based on the condition that if `l[j]` is less than `minAr`, `sm` remains 0; otherwise, if `l[j]` is greater than or equal to `minAr`, `sm` is set to 1. After the increment, `sm` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is `len(l) - 2`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and `sm` is 1 if `l[j]` was less than `minAr` or `sm` is 2 if `l[j]` was greater than or equal to `minAr`.
