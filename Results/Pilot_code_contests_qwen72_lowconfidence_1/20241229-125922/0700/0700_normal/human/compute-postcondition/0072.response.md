Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 4`, and `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements. If `l[j] < minAr`, then `minAr` is set to `l[j]`, and the value of `sm` depends on the new value of `minAr` and the last element of `l`. If `l[j] >= minAr`, then: if `l[j] > minAr`, `minAr` is set to the last element of `l`, and `sm` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `minAr` is the third-to-last element of `l`, and `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than the third-to-last element of `l`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.***
