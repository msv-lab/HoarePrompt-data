Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `j` is `len(l) - 2`. If `l[j]` < `minAr`, then `minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]` and `sm` remains 0. If `l[j]` >= `minAr`, then `sm` is set to 1 if `l[j]` > `minAr`, otherwise `sm` remains 0.***
