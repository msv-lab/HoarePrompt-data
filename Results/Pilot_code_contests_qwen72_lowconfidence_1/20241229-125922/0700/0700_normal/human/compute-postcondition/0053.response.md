The line of code `minAr = l[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `l` to the variable `minAr`. This impacts the value of `minAr`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in the original `l` that are greater than the minimum value in the original `l`**.
