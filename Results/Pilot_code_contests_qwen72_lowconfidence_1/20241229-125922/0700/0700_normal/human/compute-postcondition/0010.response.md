The value of `sm` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `minAr`, and `j` are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`, `sm` is 1, `j` is `len(l) - 2`, and the current value of `l[j]` is greater than `minAr`.**
