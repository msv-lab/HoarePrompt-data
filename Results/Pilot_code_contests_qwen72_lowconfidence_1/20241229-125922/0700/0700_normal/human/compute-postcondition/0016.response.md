Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is `len(l) - 3`. If `l[j]` > `minAr`, `sm` is set to 1 and `minAr` remains unchanged. If `l[j]` <= `minAr`, `minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]` and `sm` remains 0.***
