To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` is 0
- `n` is equal to `t`
- `l` is a list of integers from user input
- `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`
- `sm` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `len(l) - 2` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - This means the loop will start at `len(l) - 2` and decrement `j` until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(l) - 2` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Simplifying this condition:
     \[
     len(l) - 2 \geq -1 \implies len(l) \geq 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if the list `l` has at least 1 element.

3. **Initial State of `j`:**
   - The initial value of `j` will be `len(l) - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- The list `l` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `j` will be `len(l) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`, `sm` is 0, `j` is `len(l) - 2`**
