The list comprehension `l = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in the list `l`.

- `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains equal to `t`.
- `l` is now a list of integers derived from user input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input**.
