Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements. After the loop executes, `j` is -1, `minAr` is the minimum value found in the list `l` starting from the second last element to the first element (inclusive), and `sm` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr` from the second last element to the first element (inclusive).**
