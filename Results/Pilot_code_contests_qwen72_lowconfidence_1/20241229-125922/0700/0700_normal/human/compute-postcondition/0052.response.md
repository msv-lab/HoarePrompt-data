The line of code `l = [int(j) for j in raw_input().split(' ')]` reads a space-separated string of numbers from the input, splits the string into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.

- `l` is now a list of integers derived from the input.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `j`, `n`, `minAr`, and `sm` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in the original `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in the original `l` that are greater than the minimum value in the original `l`**.
