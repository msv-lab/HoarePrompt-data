`minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]`. Since the current value of `l[j]` is less than the previous `minAr`, `minAr` now holds this smaller value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `minAr` is the value of `l[j]`, `sm` is 0, `j` is `len(l) - 2`. The current value of `l[j]` is less than the previous `minAr`.**
