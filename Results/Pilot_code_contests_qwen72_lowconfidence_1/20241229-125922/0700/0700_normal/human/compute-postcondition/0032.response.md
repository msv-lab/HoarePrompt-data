The code snippet `minAr = l[j]` updates the value of `minAr` to the value of the element in the list `l` at the index `j`. Given that `j` is -1, this means `minAr` is updated to the last element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 0, and the current value of `l[j]` (which is the last element of `l`) is equal to `minAr`**.
