The code snippet prints the value of `sm`, which is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`. This operation does not change the state of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`.**
