The code snippet `sm += 1` increments the value of `sm` by 1. The initial value of `sm` is determined by the conditions specified in the initial state. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 5 elements, `j` is `len(l) - 4`, `minAr` remains unchanged, `sm` is incremented by 1.**
