The value of `sm` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `l`, and `minAr` remain unchanged. The final value of `sm` will depend on its initial value before the increment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 4`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements, `minAr` is determined by the conditions given in the initial state, `sm` is `sm + 1`.**
