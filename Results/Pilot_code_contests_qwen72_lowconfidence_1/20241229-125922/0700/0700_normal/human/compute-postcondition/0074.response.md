The code snippet `print(sm)` simply outputs the value of the variable `sm` to the console. The value of `sm` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr`. Since no modifications to any variables are made within this code snippet, all the initial state variables remain unchanged except for the action of printing `sm`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in the list `l`, and `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr`. If `l` has fewer than 2 elements, `minAr` remains the last element of `l`, while `sm` remains 0. The value of `sm` has been printed.**
