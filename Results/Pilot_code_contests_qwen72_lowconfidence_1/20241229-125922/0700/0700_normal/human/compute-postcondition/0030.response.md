To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input string
- `j` is -1
- `l` is a list of integers from user input
- `minAr` is the last element of `l`
- `sm` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range `range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1)`.
   - This means the loop starts at `len(l) - 2` and decrements `j` by 1 until it reaches -1 (inclusive).
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(l) - 2 >= -1`, which simplifies to `len(l) >= 2`.

2. **Initial State of `j`**:
   - The variable `j` is initially set to -1, but this is not relevant to the loop's execution because `j` is reassigned in the loop.

3. **List `l`**:
   - The loop will only execute if the list `l` has at least 2 elements. If `l` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not run.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\) (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input string (unchanged)
- `j` is -1 (unchanged, but will be reassigned in the loop)
- `l` must have at least 2 elements (adjusted)
- `minAr` is the last element of `l` (unchanged)
- `sm` is 0 (unchanged)

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 0**
