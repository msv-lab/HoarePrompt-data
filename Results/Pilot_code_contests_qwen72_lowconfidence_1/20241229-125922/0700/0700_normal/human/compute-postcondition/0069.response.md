The code snippet assigns the value of `l[j]` to `minAr`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the changes:

- `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains a new input string.
- `j` remains `len(l) - 4`.
- `l` remains a list of integers from user input with at least 4 elements.
- `minAr` is updated to `l[j]`.

Since the value of `l[j]` is assigned to `minAr`, the value of `minAr` changes based on the current value of `l[j]`. The value of `sm` and the conditions around `minAr` and `sm` are not directly affected by this assignment, but they may depend on the new value of `minAr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 4`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements, `minAr` is `l[j]`, and the value of `sm` depends on the new value of `minAr` and the last element of `l`.**
