Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, and `minAr` is the last element of `l`. If the last element of `l` (which is `l[j]` or `l[-1]`) is less than `minAr`, then `sm` is 0. Otherwise, if the last element of `l` is greater than or equal to `minAr`, then `sm` is 1.***
