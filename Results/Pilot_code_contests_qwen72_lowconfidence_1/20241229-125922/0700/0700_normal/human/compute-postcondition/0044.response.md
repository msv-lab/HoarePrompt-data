The line of code `minAr = l[j]` updates the value of `minAr` to the value of the third-to-last element in the list `l`.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input string
- `j` is `len(l) - 3`
- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements
- `minAr` was initially the last element of `l` but is now updated to `l[j]` (the third-to-last element of `l`)

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is `len(l) - 3`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `minAr` is the third-to-last element of `l`.**
