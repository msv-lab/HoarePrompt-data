Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element, `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`, `sm` is 0, `j` is `len(l) - 2`, and `l[j]` is greater than or equal to `minAr`.**
