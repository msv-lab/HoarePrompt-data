To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Loop:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a new input string
- `j` is `len(l) - 3`
- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements
- If `l[j] < minAr`, then `minAr` is the third-to-last element of `l`, and `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than the third-to-last element of `l`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.
- If `l[j] >= minAr`, then `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and if `l[j] > minAr`, `sm` is 2; otherwise, `sm` remains 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1)`, which means `j` starts at `len(l) - 3` (the second-to-last index) and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `len(l) - 4`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains the same: \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` remains the same: 2
- `n` remains the same: a new input string
- `j` is now `len(l) - 4`
- `l` remains the same: a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements
- The values of `minAr` and `sm` depend on the new value of `l[j]` (which is now `l[len(l) - 4]`).

### Updated State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is a new input string
- `j` is `len(l) - 4`
- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements
- If `l[j] < minAr`, then `minAr` is the third-to-last element of `l`, and `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than the third-to-last element of `l`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.
- If `l[j] >= minAr`, then `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and if `l[j] > minAr`, `sm` is 2; otherwise, `sm` remains 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 4`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements. If `l[j] < minAr`, then `minAr` is the third-to-last element of `l`, and `sm` is 0 if the last element of `l` is less than the third-to-last element of `l`; otherwise, `sm` is 1. If `l[j] >= minAr`, then `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and if `l[j] > minAr`, `sm` is 2; otherwise, `sm` remains 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.**
