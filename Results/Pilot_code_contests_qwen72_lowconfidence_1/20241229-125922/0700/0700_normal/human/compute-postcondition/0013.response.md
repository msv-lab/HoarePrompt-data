To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 1 element.
- `j` is `len(l) - 2`.
- If `l[j]` < `minAr`, then `minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]` and `sm` remains 0.
- If `l[j]` >= `minAr`, then `sm` is set to 1 if `l[j]` > `minAr`, otherwise `sm` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `l` starting from `len(l) - 2` and going down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `len(l) - 2`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will execute one more time if `j` is decremented by 1 and remains within the bounds of the loop.
- The next value of `j` will be `len(l) - 3`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Updated State:
- `j` is now `len(l) - 3`.
- The conditions for `minAr` and `sm` will be re-evaluated based on the new value of `l[j]`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is `len(l) - 3`. If `l[j]` < `minAr`, then `minAr` is updated to the value of `l[j]` and `sm` remains 0. If `l[j]` >= `minAr`, then `sm` is set to 1 if `l[j]` > `minAr`, otherwise `sm` remains 0.**
