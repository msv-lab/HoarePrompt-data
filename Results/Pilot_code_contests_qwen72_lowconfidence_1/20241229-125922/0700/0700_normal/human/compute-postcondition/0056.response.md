Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, `sm` is 0, and the current value of `l[j]` (which is the last element of `l`) is less than `minAr`.***
