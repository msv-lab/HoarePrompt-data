Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 3 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`, and the last element of `l` is less than or equal to `minAr`. If `l[j]` (which is the same as `l[-1]`) is greater than `minAr`, then `sm` is 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains 0.***
