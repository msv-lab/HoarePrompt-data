Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `n` is a new input string, `j` is `len(l) - 3`, `l` is a list of integers from user input that must have at least 4 elements, `minAr` is the last element of `l`. If `l[j] > minAr`, `sm` is 2. Otherwise, `sm` remains 0 if the last element of `l` is less than `minAr`; otherwise, `sm` is 1.***
