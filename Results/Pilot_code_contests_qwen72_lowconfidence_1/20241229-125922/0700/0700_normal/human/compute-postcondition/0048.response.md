To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, let's analyze the code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input string.
- `j` is -1.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `minAr` is the last element of `l`.
- `sm` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(len(l) - 2, -1, -1):
    if l[j] < minAr:
        minAr = l[j]
    elif l[j] > minAr:
        sm += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `l` starting from the second-to-last element (`len(l) - 2`) down to the first element (`0`).
   - The loop will execute `len(l) - 1` times if `l` has at least 2 elements.

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `j` will take values from `len(l) - 2` down to `0`.
   - `minAr` will be updated to the smallest element found in the list `l` during the iterations.
   - `sm` will count the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the current `minAr`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `-1` because the loop ends when `j` reaches `-1`.
   - `minAr` will be the minimum value in the list `l`.
   - `sm` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`.

### Output State:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains the input string.
- `j` is `-1`.
- `l` is a list of integers from user input.
- `minAr` is the minimum value in the list `l`.
- `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input string, `j` is -1, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the minimum value in `l`, `sm` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the minimum value in `l`.**
