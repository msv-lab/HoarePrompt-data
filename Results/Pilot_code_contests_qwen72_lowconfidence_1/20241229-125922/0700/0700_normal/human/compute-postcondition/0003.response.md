The code `minAr = l[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `l` to the variable `minAr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\).
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains equal to `t`.
- `l` is a list of integers derived from user input.

After executing the code, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\),
- `i` is 0,
- `n` is equal to `t`,
- `l` is a list of integers from user input,
- `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `l` is a list of integers from user input, `minAr` is the last element of the list `l`**.
