Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000), `l` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `minAr` is the minimum value in the list `l` starting from the second last element to the first element (inclusive), `sm` is the count of elements in the list `l` that are strictly greater than `minAr`, and the value of `sm` is printed for each of the `t` data sets. If any list `l` has fewer than 2 elements, `minAr` remains the last element of `l`, while `sm` remains 0.**
