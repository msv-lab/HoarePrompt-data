The function `func` processes multiple data sets, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each data set, it calculates the number of elements in the list that are strictly greater than the minimum value found from the last element to the first. The result, `sm`, is printed for each data set. If a list has fewer than 2 elements, the function prints 0 for that data set. The function reads inputs from standard input and does not return any values. After the function completes, the state of the program includes the processed data sets and the printed results, but the original input values (`t`, `n`, and `l`) are no longer accessible.
