The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `p - 2`, modulo `p`. This effectively computes the modular inverse of `n` under modulo `p` when `n` and `p` are coprime. If `n` and `p` are not coprime, the result may not be meaningful as a modular inverse.
