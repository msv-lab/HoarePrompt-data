You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.

Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has a sticks and b diamonds?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.

Output

For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.

Example

Input


4
4 4
1000000000 0
7 15
8 7


Output


2
0
7
5

Note

In the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel.

In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_11` is supposed to solve the problem of calculating the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn by crafting shovels and swords. However, the implementation of `func_11` does not correctly handle the logic required to solve this problem. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4 4
```
According to the problem, Polycarp can craft 2 shovels and 2 swords, earning 4 emeralds in total. However, the function `func_11` will output `2`, which is incorrect.

The function `func_11` currently calculates the minimum of the number of sticks, the number of diamonds, and one-third of their sum, which does not align with the logic needed to maximize the number of emeralds by crafting shovels and swords. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 11 : The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_6()`, which should return a non-negative integer. For each test case, it calls `func_4()` to get a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively. The function then calculates the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` and prints this value. If `func_6()` returns 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. After the loop completes, no variables are retained outside the loop, and the only side effect is the printed values. Edge cases include `func_6()` returning 0 (resulting in no iterations), and `func_4()` returning negative values or non-integer values, which are not explicitly handled in the code.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
