Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_11` is intended to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn by crafting shovels and swords. However, the logic used in the function does not correctly implement the required solution.

The function calculates `min(l, r, (l + r) // 3)` and prints this value. This logic is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the maximum number of tools (shovels and swords) that can be crafted given the constraints of the problem.

### Correct Logic:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- Each shovel requires 2 sticks and 1 diamond.
- Each sword requires 1 stick and 2 diamonds.
- We want to maximize the total number of tools (shovels + swords) that can be crafted.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the maximum number of shovels that can be crafted with the available sticks and diamonds.
2. Calculating the maximum number of swords that can be crafted with the available sticks and diamonds.
3. Summing the maximum number of shovels and swords to get the total number of tools.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input `(4, 4)`:
- The function `func_11` calculates `min(4, 4, (4 + 4) // 3) = min(4, 4, 2) = 2`.
- However, the correct answer is `4` because:
  - Polycarp can craft 2 shovels (using 4 sticks and 2 diamonds).
  - Polycarp can craft 1 sword (using 1 stick and 2 diamonds).
  - Total tools = 2 (shovels) + 1 (sword) = 3.

Thus, the function `func_11` does not produce the correct output for this case and fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
