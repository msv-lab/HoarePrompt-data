Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_11` is supposed to solve the problem of calculating the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn by crafting shovels and swords. However, the implementation of `func_11` does not correctly handle the logic required to solve this problem. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4 4
```
According to the problem, Polycarp can craft 2 shovels and 2 swords, earning 4 emeralds in total. However, the function `func_11` will output `2`, which is incorrect.

The function `func_11` currently calculates the minimum of the number of sticks, the number of diamonds, and one-third of their sum, which does not align with the logic needed to maximize the number of emeralds by crafting shovels and swords. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
