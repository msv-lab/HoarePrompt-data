Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_11` is supposed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn by crafting shovels and swords. However, the function calculates and prints the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3`, which does not correctly solve the problem.

The correct approach to solving this problem involves calculating the maximum number of shovels and swords that can be crafted given the constraints on sticks and diamonds. The formula to determine the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn is:

\[ \text{max\_emeralds} = \min\left(\left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + b, \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + a\right) \]

This formula ensures that we consider the constraints on both sticks and diamonds to maximize the number of emeralds. The current implementation in `func_11` does not follow this logic and instead uses a different calculation that does not align with the problem description.

For example, consider the input `(4, 4)`. The correct output should be `2` because Polycarp can craft one shovel and one sword, earning 2 emeralds. However, the current implementation would calculate `min(4, 4, (4 + 4) // 3) = min(4, 4, 2) = 2`, which coincidentally gives the correct answer for this specific case but will fail for other inputs.

Another example is the input `(7, 15)`. The correct output should be `7` because Polycarp can craft 7 shovels (using 14 sticks and 7 diamonds) and 1 sword (using 2 diamonds and 1 stick), earning 8 emeralds. However, the current implementation would calculate `min(7, 15, (7 + 15) // 3) = min(7, 15, 7) = 7`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of crafting more shovels.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
