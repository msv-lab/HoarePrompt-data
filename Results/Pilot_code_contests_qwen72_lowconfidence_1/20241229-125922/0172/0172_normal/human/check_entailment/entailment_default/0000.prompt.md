You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.

Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has a sticks and b diamonds?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.

Output

For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.

Example

Input


4
4 4
1000000000 0
7 15
8 7


Output


2
0
7
5

Note

In the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel.

In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.

    for i in range(104, 0, -1):
        ifact[i - 1] = i * ifact[i] % mod
    return (fact, ifact)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It initializes and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. 

- `fact` is a list containing the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19, each computed modulo `mod`.
- `ifact` is a list containing the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact`, also computed modulo `mod`.

The function computes the factorials and their modular inverses up to 19 and 104 respectively. However, there is a discrepancy in the size of the `ifact` list: while it is initialized to have 105 elements, only the last 104 elements (from index 1 to 104) are populated with the correct modular inverses. The first element (`ifact[0]`) remains 0, which might be an unintended side effect or a potential edge case depending on the intended use of the function. After the function executes, it returns the two lists `fact` and `ifact`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, p):
    return pow(n, p - 2, p)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1. It returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `p - 2`, modulo `p`. This effectively computes the modular inverse of `n` under modulo `p` when `n` and `p` are coprime. If `n` and `p` are not coprime, the result may not be meaningful as a modular inverse.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(n, r, fact, ifact):
    t = fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod
    return t
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates the value of `t` as `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`, where `fact[n]` is the factorial of `n`, `ifact[r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `r` under modulus `mod`, and `ifact[n - r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `n - r` under modulus `mod`. The function returns the value of `t`.

The function assumes that `n` and `r` are non-negative integers with `0 <= r <= n`, and that `fact` and `ifact` are precomputed lists where `fact[i]` and `ifact[i]` are the factorial and modular multiplicative inverse of `i` under modulus `mod`, respectively. The function does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n` or where `n` or `r` are negative, and it relies on the correctness and completeness of the `fact` and `ifact` lists.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It then converts each string in the line to an integer and returns an iterator of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError` or an empty iterator, respectively. The function does not modify any external state or variables and only returns the iterator.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits the line by spaces, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from standard input and returns this line as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not modify any external state or variables and is purely focused on reading and processing a single line of input.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `y` is guaranteed to be 0, and `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, y):
    return x * y // func_7(x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). It returns the integer division of the product of `x` and `y` by the result of `func_7(x, y)`. If `func_7(x, y)` returns 0, a ZeroDivisionError will be raised. The function does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n):
    return [n, 1, n + 1, 0][n % 4]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts an integer `n` and returns a value based on the remainder when `n` is divided by 4. Specifically, it returns `n` if `n % 4 == 0`, returns `1` if `n % 4 == 1`, returns `n + 1` if `n % 4 == 2`, and returns `0` if `n % 4 == 3`. The function covers all possible remainders (0, 1, 2, 3) when dividing by 4, ensuring that every integer input results in one of these four outputs. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(P):
    ans = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2
    return ans
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `P` and returns the largest integer `ans` such that the sum of the first `ans` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + ans`) is less than or equal to `P`. The function calculates `ans` using the formula `(-1 + sqrt(1 + 8 * P)) // 2`. If `P` is negative, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the square root of a negative number. For valid non-negative inputs, the function will always return a non-negative integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    for _ in range(int(func_6())):
        (l, r) = func_4()
        print(min(l, r, (l + r) // 3))
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_6()`, which should return a non-negative integer. For each test case, it calls `func_4()` to get a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively. The function then calculates the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` and prints this value. If `func_6()` returns 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. After the loop completes, no variables are retained outside the loop, and the only side effect is the printed values. Edge cases include `func_6()` returning 0 (resulting in no iterations), and `func_4()` returning negative values or non-integer values, which are not explicitly handled in the code.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
