Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program provided in `func_11()` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The function reads the number of test cases using `func_6()`, which reads a single line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers (the number of sticks `l` and the number of diamonds `r`) using `func_4()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them to a list of integers.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Emeralds**:
   - The function calculates the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn using the formula `min(l, r, (l + r) // 3)`.
   - This formula is derived from the constraints of the problem:
     - To craft a shovel, Polycarp needs 2 sticks and 1 diamond.
     - To craft a sword, Polycarp needs 2 diamonds and 1 stick.
     - Each tool (shovel or sword) can be sold for 1 emerald.
   - The maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn is limited by the lesser of:
     - The number of sticks `l`.
     - The number of diamonds `r`.
     - The total number of tools he can craft, which is `(l + r) // 3` because each tool requires 3 resources in total (either 2 sticks and 1 diamond or 2 diamonds and 1 stick).

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn, which is the minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description:
- If either `l` or `r` is 0, the output will be 0 because Polycarp cannot craft any tools.
- If both `l` and `r` are large, the output will be the maximum number of tools he can craft, which is the minimum of the three values.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
