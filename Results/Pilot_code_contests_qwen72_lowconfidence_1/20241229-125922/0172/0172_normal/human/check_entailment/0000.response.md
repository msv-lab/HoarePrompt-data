Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn by crafting shovels and swords from sticks and diamonds. However, the program includes several functions (`func_1` to `func_11`) that do not seem to be related to the problem at hand. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of emeralds is missing, and the provided functions are focused on other operations such as factorials, modular inverses, and greatest common divisors, which are not relevant to the problem.

A correct implementation would involve a simple calculation to determine how many shovels and swords can be crafted given the available sticks and diamonds, and then summing the total number of tools that can be crafted to determine the number of emeralds. The provided program does not contain this logic.
