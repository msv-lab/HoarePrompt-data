Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code, including all the functions, correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_6()` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_4()` reads the number of sticks and diamonds for each test case.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Emeralds:**
   - For each test case, the function `func_11` calculates the minimum of three values: the number of sticks (`l`), the number of diamonds (`r`), and the integer division of the sum of sticks and diamonds by 3 (`(l + r) // 3`).
   - This calculation ensures that the program finds the maximum number of tools (shovels and swords) that can be crafted and sold for emeralds.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If either `l` or `r` is 0, the minimum value will be 0, which is correct because no tools can be crafted.
   - If `l` and `r` are large, the calculation `(l + r) // 3` ensures that the program does not exceed the available resources.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints \(0 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).

4. **Examples:**
   - For the input `(4, 4)`, the output is `2` (one shovel and one sword).
   - For the input `(1000000000, 0)`, the output is `0` (no diamonds, so no tools can be crafted).
   - For the input `(7, 15)`, the output is `7` (7 shovels).
   - For the input `(8, 7)`, the output is `5` (5 shovels and 2 swords).

All the functions and the main logic in `func_11` work as expected and cover all potential cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
