The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from standard input and returns this line as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty string. The function does not modify any external state or variables and is purely focused on reading and processing a single line of input.
