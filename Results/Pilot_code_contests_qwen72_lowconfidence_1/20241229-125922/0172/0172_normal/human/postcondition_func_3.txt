The function `func_4` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It then converts each string in the line to an integer and returns an iterator of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values or is empty, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError` or an empty iterator, respectively. The function does not modify any external state or variables and only returns the iterator.
