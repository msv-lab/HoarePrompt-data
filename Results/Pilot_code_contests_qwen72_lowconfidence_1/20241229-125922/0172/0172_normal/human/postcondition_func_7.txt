The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are non-negative integers (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). It returns the integer division of the product of `x` and `y` by the result of `func_7(x, y)`. If `func_7(x, y)` returns 0, a ZeroDivisionError will be raised. The function does not modify the input parameters `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the returned value.
