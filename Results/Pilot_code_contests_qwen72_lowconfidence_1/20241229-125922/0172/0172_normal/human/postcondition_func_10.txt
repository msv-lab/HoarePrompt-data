The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the function `func_6()`, which should return a non-negative integer. For each test case, it calls `func_4()` to get a tuple of two integers `(l, r)` representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively. The function then calculates the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` and prints this value. If `func_6()` returns 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. After the loop completes, no variables are retained outside the loop, and the only side effect is the printed values. Edge cases include `func_6()` returning 0 (resulting in no iterations), and `func_4()` returning negative values or non-integer values, which are not explicitly handled in the code.
