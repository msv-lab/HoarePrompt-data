The code snippet assigns new values to `l` and `r` by calling `func_4()`. This means that `l` and `r` are now updated to new integers returned by `func_4()`. The precondition that `func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0 remains unchanged. The statement about the minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` having been printed is no longer relevant because `l` and `r` have been reassigned, and the loop having one fewer iteration remaining also remains true.

Output State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, `r` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, the loop has one fewer iteration remaining.**
