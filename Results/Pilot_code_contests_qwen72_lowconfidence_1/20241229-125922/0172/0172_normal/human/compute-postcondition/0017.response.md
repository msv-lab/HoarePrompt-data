Output State: **The program returns `fact` which is a list containing the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19 modulo `mod`, and `ifact` which is a list containing the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact` modulo `mod`. The lists are precomputed as described in the initial state.**
