The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses the values returned by `func_6()` and `func_4()`. `func_6()` returns an integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_4()` returns a tuple of two integers (l, r) representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively.

Based on the internal use of these functions, the output of `func_11` is not explicitly described in the given context. However, we can infer that the function likely processes the number of test cases and the tuple (l, r) to produce some form of output, but the exact nature of this output is not specified.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_11` is to:
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It uses the number of test cases from `func_6()` and a tuple (l, r) from `func_4()`, representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively, to produce an unspecified output.**
