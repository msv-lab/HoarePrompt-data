Output State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than or equal to 0. If `func_6()` returns 0, the loop does not execute, and no values of `l` or `r` are defined. If `func_6()` returns an integer greater than 0, the loop executes that many times. For each iteration, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_4()`, and the minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` is printed. After the loop completes, no variables are modified or retained outside the loop, except for the side effect of the printed values.**
