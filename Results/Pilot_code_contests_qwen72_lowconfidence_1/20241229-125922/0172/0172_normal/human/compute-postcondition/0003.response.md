To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0.
- `l` is an integer.
- `r` is an integer.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(func_6())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_6()` returns an integer greater than 0. The number of iterations is determined by the value returned by `func_6()`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is an integer.
   - `r` is an integer.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Function Call**: The loop condition is checked before each iteration, and it depends on the result of `func_6()`.
- **Iteration Count**: The loop will execute `int(func_6())` times. After each iteration, the loop counter (denoted by `_`) is incremented, but this does not affect the state variables directly.
- **State Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_6()` must still return an integer greater than 0. The values of `l` and `r` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only requirement is that `func_6()` must continue to return an integer greater than 0. The values of `l` and `r` do not need to change.

State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer**
