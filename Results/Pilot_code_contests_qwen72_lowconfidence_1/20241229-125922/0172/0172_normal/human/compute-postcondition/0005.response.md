The `print(min(l, r, (l + r) // 3))` statement prints the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3`. The variables `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_4()`, and `func_6()` returns an integer greater than 0, which is not directly used in this code snippet.

The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged after this operation. The output of the `print` function does not affect the state of the program, so no new variables are introduced or modified.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, `r` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, and the minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` has been printed.**
