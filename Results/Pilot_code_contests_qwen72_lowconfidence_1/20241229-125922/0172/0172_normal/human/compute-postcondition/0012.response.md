To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 104.
   - `ifact[104]` is `pow(fact[104], mod - 2, mod)`.
   - `ifact[103]` is `104 * pow(fact[104], mod - 2, mod) % mod`.
   - `fact` is an array containing the factorial values modulo `mod` up to 19.

2. **Loop Structure**:
   ```python
   for i in range(104, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 103.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be decremented from 104 to 103.
   - The value of `ifact[102]` will be calculated based on the current value of `ifact[103]`.

Given the loop structure and the current state, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is 103.
- `ifact[103]` remains `104 * pow(fact[104], mod - 2, mod) % mod`.
- `ifact[102]` will be calculated as `103 * ifact[103] % mod`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`fact` = [1, 1 % mod, 2 % mod, (2 % mod) * 3 % mod, ..., (19! % mod)], `i` is 103, `ifact` = [0] * 105, `ifact[104]` = `pow(fact[104], mod - 2, mod)`, `ifact[103]` = `104 * pow(fact[104], mod - 2, mod) % mod`, `ifact[102]` = `103 * ifact[103] % mod`**
