The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_4()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since `func_4()` returns a tuple of two integers `(l, r)`, both `l` and `r` will now hold the respective integer values from the tuple. The function `func_6()` remains unaffected by this code and must still return an integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer**
