The code snippet assigns the values returned by the function `func_4()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the initial state specifies that `func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, this does not affect the current operation, as the code snippet is only concerned with the values returned by `func_4()`. The values of `l` and `r` are now the outputs of `func_4()`, which are integers, but their specific values are not known. The initial state of `l` and `r` being integers is updated to reflect the new values from `func_4()`. 

Output State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, `r` is an integer returned by `func_4()`**
