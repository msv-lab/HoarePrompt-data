To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given information:

1. **Function Calls and Their Returns**: The loop depends on the value returned by `func_6()`, which should return an integer representing the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range specified by `int(func_6())` is greater than 0.

Given that there are no input parameters in the function signature, we need to ensure that `func_6()` returns a positive integer to allow the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the internal use of `func_4()` suggests that this function should return valid values (a tuple of two integers), but it does not directly affect the loop condition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Ensure `func_6()` Returns a Positive Integer**:
   - For the loop to execute, `int(func_6())` must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State of Loop Variables**:
   - The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be initialized explicitly.

3. **Internal Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function should return a valid tuple of two integers, but it does not affect the loop condition directly.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `func_6()` returns a positive integer. The initial state should reflect this requirement.

State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `func_4()` must return a tuple of two integers (l, r)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, and the internal function `func_4()` will provide valid values as required by the program logic.
