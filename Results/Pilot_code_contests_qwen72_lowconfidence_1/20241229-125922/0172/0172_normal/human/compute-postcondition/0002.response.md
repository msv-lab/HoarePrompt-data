The code snippet prints the minimum value among `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3`. This operation does not change the values of `l` or `r`, nor does it affect the return value of `func_6()`. The output state remains the same for these variables.

Output State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer**
