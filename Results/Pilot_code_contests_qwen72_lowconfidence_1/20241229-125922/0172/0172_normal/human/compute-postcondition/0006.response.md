To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as the range defined by `int(func_6())` has elements left to iterate over. The range is determined by the integer value returned by `func_6()`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is an integer returned by `func_4()`.
   - `r` is an integer returned by `func_4()`.
   - The minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` has been printed.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates. However, since `_` is not used within the loop, it does not affect the state.
   - The key condition for the loop to continue is that the number of iterations remaining in the range defined by `int(func_6())` must be greater than 0.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `func_6()` remains the same, and it must still return an integer greater than 0.
   - The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
   - The loop will execute one more time if there are still elements left in the range defined by `int(func_6())`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop has one fewer iteration remaining. However, since the loop variable `_` is not used, we only need to ensure that the loop can still execute based on the initial value of `func_6()`.

State: **`func_6()` must return an integer greater than 0, `l` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, `r` is an integer returned by `func_4()`, and the minimum of `l`, `r`, and `(l + r) // 3` has been printed. The loop has one fewer iteration remaining.**
