The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It initializes and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. The list `fact` contains the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19, each taken modulo `mod`. The list `ifact` contains the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact`, also taken modulo `mod`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. `fact` contains the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19 modulo `mod`, and `ifact` contains the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact` modulo `mod`.**
