The function `func_7` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `y` is guaranteed to be 0, and `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles edge cases where either `x` or `y` is 0 by correctly returning the non-zero value as the GCD.
