No input parameters are present in the function signature. The function internally uses values returned by `func_6()` and `func_4()`, where `func_6()` should return an integer representing the number of test cases, and `func_4()` should return a tuple of two integers (l, r) representing the number of sticks and diamonds, respectively.
