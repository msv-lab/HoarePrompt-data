The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin), splits the line by spaces, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input line is empty or contains only whitespace, the function will return an empty list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised.
