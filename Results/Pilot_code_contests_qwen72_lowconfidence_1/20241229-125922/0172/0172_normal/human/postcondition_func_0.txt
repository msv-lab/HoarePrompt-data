The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It initializes and returns two lists, `fact` and `ifact`. 

- `fact` is a list containing the factorial of numbers from 0 to 19, each computed modulo `mod`.
- `ifact` is a list containing the modular multiplicative inverses of the factorials in `fact`, also computed modulo `mod`.

The function computes the factorials and their modular inverses up to 19 and 104 respectively. However, there is a discrepancy in the size of the `ifact` list: while it is initialized to have 105 elements, only the last 104 elements (from index 1 to 104) are populated with the correct modular inverses. The first element (`ifact[0]`) remains 0, which might be an unintended side effect or a potential edge case depending on the intended use of the function. After the function executes, it returns the two lists `fact` and `ifact`.
