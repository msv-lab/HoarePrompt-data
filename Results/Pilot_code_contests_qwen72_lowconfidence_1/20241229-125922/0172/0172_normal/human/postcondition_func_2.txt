The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `n`, `r`, `fact`, and `ifact`. It calculates the value of `t` as `fact[n] * (ifact[r] * ifact[n - r]) % mod % mod`, where `fact[n]` is the factorial of `n`, `ifact[r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `r` under modulus `mod`, and `ifact[n - r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `n - r` under modulus `mod`. The function returns the value of `t`.

The function assumes that `n` and `r` are non-negative integers with `0 <= r <= n`, and that `fact` and `ifact` are precomputed lists where `fact[i]` and `ifact[i]` are the factorial and modular multiplicative inverse of `i` under modulus `mod`, respectively. The function does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n` or where `n` or `r` are negative, and it relies on the correctness and completeness of the `fact` and `ifact` lists.
