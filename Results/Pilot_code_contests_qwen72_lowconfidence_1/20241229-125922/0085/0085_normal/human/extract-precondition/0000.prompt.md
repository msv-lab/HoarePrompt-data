You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Snuke has decided to play a game, where the player runs a railway company. There are M+1 stations on Snuke Line, numbered 0 through M. A train on Snuke Line stops at station 0 and every d-th station thereafter, where d is a predetermined constant for each train. For example, if d = 3, the train stops at station 0, 3, 6, 9, and so forth.

There are N kinds of souvenirs sold in areas around Snuke Line. The i-th kind of souvenirs can be purchased when the train stops at one of the following stations: stations l_i, l_i+1, l_i+2, ..., r_i.

There are M values of d, the interval between two stops, for trains on Snuke Line: 1, 2, 3, ..., M. For each of these M values, find the number of the kinds of souvenirs that can be purchased if one takes a train with that value of d at station 0. Here, assume that it is not allowed to change trains.

Constraints

* 1 ≦ N ≦ 3 × 10^{5}
* 1 ≦ M ≦ 10^{5}
* 1 ≦ l_i ≦ r_i ≦ M

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
l_1 r_1
:
l_{N} r_{N}


Output

Print the answer in M lines. The i-th line should contain the maximum number of the kinds of souvenirs that can be purchased if one takes a train stopping every i-th station.
