#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer from the interval [0..32767].
def func_1(num):
    return num.x if isinstance(num, Num) else num
    #The program returns the integer value of `num` from the interval [0..32767], as `num` is not an instance of a custom class `Num` and thus the else clause is executed returning `num` directly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. If `num` is an instance of a custom class `Num`, it returns the attribute `x` of `num`. Otherwise, it returns `num` directly. The function assumes that `num` is either an integer within the interval [0..32767] or an instance of the `Num` class. If `num` is an integer, it is returned unchanged. If `num` is an instance of `Num`, it should have an attribute `x` which is also expected to be an integer within the interval [0..32767]. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either the integer value of `num` or the integer value of `num.x` if `num` is an instance of `Num`.
