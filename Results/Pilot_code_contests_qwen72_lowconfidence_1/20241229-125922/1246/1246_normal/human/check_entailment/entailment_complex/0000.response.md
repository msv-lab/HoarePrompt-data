Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Modulo Operations**:
   - The problem description specifies that arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) are performed modulo 32768. However, the provided program uses a custom `Num` class with operations that are not correctly implementing the modulo operation. Specifically, the `__div__` method should perform integer division, but it is not defined in the provided code. Instead, the program uses `op.div`, which is not available in Python 3 (it should be `op.floordiv` for integer division).

2. **Incorrect Function Execution**:
   - The program attempts to dynamically create a function `F` from the input C++ code. However, the way it processes the C++ code and converts it to Python is flawed. For example, the regular expressions used to transform the C++ code into Python code are not robust enough to handle all possible valid C++ code as described in the problem statement. This could lead to incorrect transformations and, consequently, incorrect behavior of the generated function `F`.

3. **Incorrect Cache Handling**:
   - The program uses a cache to store the results of the function `F` for different values of `n`. However, the cache is not properly initialized or updated. The function `f` is defined as `lambda n: Num(cache[func_1(n)])`, which assumes that `cache` already contains the results for all possible values of `n`. This is not guaranteed, and the program does not handle the case where the cache does not contain the required value.

4. **Incorrect Final State**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return the integer value of `num` from the interval [0..32767]. However, the implementation of `func_1` is not necessary and does not add any value to the program. The program should directly compare the result of `F(i)` with the input `n` without the need for `func_1`.

### Case Where the Program Does Not Follow the Problem Description:
- **Example**: Consider the C++ function:
  ```cpp
  int f(int n) {
      if (n == 0) return 0;
      return (f(n - 1) + 1) % 32768;
  }
  ```
  - The input `n = 13` should return `13` because the function `f` increments the value of `n` by 1 for each recursive call until `n` reaches 0. The program should correctly compute this and return `13`. However, due to the issues mentioned above, the program might not correctly handle the modulo operation or the recursive calls, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description due to issues with modulo operations, dynamic function creation, and cache handling. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
