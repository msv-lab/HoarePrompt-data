You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function f(n). Petya ran the program with a certain value of n and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of n the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!

Mostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:

  * function ::= int f(int n) {operatorSequence}
  * operatorSequence ::= operator | operator operatorSequence
  * operator ::= return arithmExpr; | if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;
  * logicalExpr ::= arithmExpr > arithmExpr | arithmExpr < arithmExpr | arithmExpr == arithmExpr
  * arithmExpr ::= sum
  * sum ::= product | sum + product | sum - product
  * product ::= multiplier | product * multiplier | product / multiplier
  * multiplier ::= n | number | f(arithmExpr)
  * number ::= 0|1|2|... |32767



The whitespaces in a operatorSequence are optional.

Thus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator "return arithmExpr;" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator "if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language — cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the n parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].

The operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations ">" (more), "<" (less) and "==" (equals) also have standard meanings.

Now you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division "/" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.

Examples of arithmetical operations: 

<image>

Guaranteed that for all values of n from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:

1. Division by 0 never occures.

2. When performing a function for the value n = N recursive calls of the function f may occur only for the parameter value of 0, 1, ..., N - 1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.

3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.

We have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function f is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of n parameter. That's why the f function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of n from the interval [0..32767] and a value of f(n) from the same interval.

Given the value of f(n), and you should find n. If the suitable n value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).

Input

The first line has an integer f(n) from the interval [0..32767]. The next lines have the description of the function f. In the description can be found extra spaces and line breaks (see the examples) which, of course, can’t break key words int, if, return and numbers. The size of input data can’t exceed 100 bytes.

Output

Output a single number — the answer to the problem. If there’s no answer, output "-1" (without quotes).

17
int f(int n)

if (n &lt; 100) return 17;

Program:
```
import re
import sys
import operator as op

(fin, fout) = (sys.stdin, sys.stdout)
MOD = 2 ** 15
make_op = lambda op: lambda s, o: Num(op(s.x, o.x) % MOD)
make_cmp = lambda op: lambda s, o: op(s.x, o.x)
class Num:

    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.x = obj.x if isinstance(obj, Num) else int(obj)
    __add__ = make_op(op.add)
    __sub__ = make_op(op.sub)
    __div__ = make_op(op.div)
    __mul__ = make_op(op.mul)
    __eq__ = make_cmp(op.eq)
    __lt__ = make_cmp(op.lt)
    __gt__ = make_cmp(op.gt)
n = int(fin.readline())
text = ''.join(fin.readlines())
for (pat, repl) in [('\\s', ''), ('return', 'return '), ('.*{(.*)}.*', '\\1'), ('(\\d+)', 'Num(\\1)'), ('(if.*?)(return)', '\\1:\\2'), (';', '\n\t')]:
    text = re.sub(pat, repl, text)
text = 'def F(n):\n\tn = Num(n)\n\t' + text
exec(compile(text.strip(), 'f**k', 'exec'))
cache = {}
f = lambda n: Num(cache[func_1(n)])
ans = -1
for i in range(0, MOD):
    t = cache[i] = Num(F(i))
    if func_1(t) == n:
        ans = i
print(ans)

def func_1(num):
    return num.x if isinstance(num, Num) else num


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. If `num` is an instance of a custom class `Num`, it returns the attribute `x` of `num`. Otherwise, it returns `num` directly. The function assumes that `num` is either an integer within the interval [0..32767] or an instance of the `Num` class. If `num` is an integer, it is returned unchanged. If `num` is an instance of `Num`, it should have an attribute `x` which is also expected to be an integer within the interval [0..32767]. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either the integer value of `num` or the integer value of `num.x` if `num` is an instance of `Num`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
