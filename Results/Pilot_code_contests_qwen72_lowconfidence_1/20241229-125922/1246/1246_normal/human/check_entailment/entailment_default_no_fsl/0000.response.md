Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the inversion of the function `f(n)` for every potential case. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Division Handling**: The division operation in the `Num` class is defined using `op.div`, which performs floating-point division. However, according to the problem description, division should be integer division where the remainder is omitted. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results for functions involving division.

2. **Cache Initialization**: The cache is initialized inside the loop, which means it is reset for each iteration. This can lead to incorrect results because the cache should retain values across iterations to avoid recalculating them, especially in recursive functions.

3. **Function Compilation and Execution**: The code uses `exec` to compile and execute the function `F(n)`, which is dynamically generated from the input. While this approach is creative, it can introduce subtle bugs if the input function is complex or if there are edge cases not handled properly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not explicitly handle edge cases where the function `f(n)` might have multiple valid `n` values or where the function might not return a value for any `n` in the range [0..32767]. The problem description requires finding the maximal `n` if there are multiple valid values, but the code does not guarantee this behavior.

To ensure correctness, the code should:
- Use integer division for the `Num` class.
- Initialize the cache outside the loop to retain values across iterations.
- Handle edge cases where multiple valid `n` values exist by finding the maximal one.
- Ensure that the function `f(n)` is correctly compiled and executed without introducing bugs.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
