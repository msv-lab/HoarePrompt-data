You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya wrote a programme on C++ that calculated a very interesting function f(n). Petya ran the program with a certain value of n and went to the kitchen to have some tea. The history has no records concerning how long the program had been working. By the time Petya returned, it had completed the calculations and had the result. However while Petya was drinking tea, a sly virus managed to destroy the input file so that Petya can't figure out for which value of n the program was run. Help Petya, carry out the inverse function!

Mostly, the program consists of a function in C++ with the following simplified syntax:

  * function ::= int f(int n) {operatorSequence}
  * operatorSequence ::= operator | operator operatorSequence
  * operator ::= return arithmExpr; | if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;
  * logicalExpr ::= arithmExpr > arithmExpr | arithmExpr < arithmExpr | arithmExpr == arithmExpr
  * arithmExpr ::= sum
  * sum ::= product | sum + product | sum - product
  * product ::= multiplier | product * multiplier | product / multiplier
  * multiplier ::= n | number | f(arithmExpr)
  * number ::= 0|1|2|... |32767



The whitespaces in a operatorSequence are optional.

Thus, we have a function, in which body there are two kinds of operators. There is the operator "return arithmExpr;" that returns the value of the expression as the value of the function, and there is the conditional operator "if (logicalExpr) return arithmExpr;" that returns the value of the arithmetical expression when and only when the logical expression is true. Guaranteed that no other constructions of C++ language — cycles, assignment operators, nested conditional operators etc, and other variables except the n parameter are used in the function. All the constants are integers in the interval [0..32767].

The operators are performed sequentially. After the function has returned a value other operators in the sequence are not performed. Arithmetical expressions are performed taking into consideration the standard priority of the operations. It means that first all the products that are part of the sum are calculated. During the calculation of the products the operations of multiplying and division are performed from the left to the right. Then the summands are summed, and the addition and the subtraction are also performed from the left to the right. Operations ">" (more), "<" (less) and "==" (equals) also have standard meanings.

Now you've got to pay close attention! The program is compiled with the help of 15-bit Berland C++ compiler invented by a Berland company BerSoft, that's why arithmetical operations are performed in a non-standard way. Addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo 32768 (if the result of subtraction is negative, then 32768 is added to it until the number belongs to the interval [0..32767]). Division "/" is a usual integer division where the remainder is omitted.

Examples of arithmetical operations: 

<image>

Guaranteed that for all values of n from 0 to 32767 the given function is performed correctly. That means that:

1. Division by 0 never occures.

2. When performing a function for the value n = N recursive calls of the function f may occur only for the parameter value of 0, 1, ..., N - 1. Consequently, the program never has an infinite recursion.

3. As the result of the sequence of the operators, the function always returns a value.

We have to mention that due to all the limitations the value returned by the function f is independent from either global variables or the order of performing the calculations of arithmetical expressions as part of the logical one, or from anything else except the value of n parameter. That's why the f function can be regarded as a function in its mathematical sense, i.e. as a unique correspondence between any value of n from the interval [0..32767] and a value of f(n) from the same interval.

Given the value of f(n), and you should find n. If the suitable n value is not unique, you should find the maximal one (from the interval [0..32767]).

Input

The first line has an integer f(n) from the interval [0..32767]. The next lines have the description of the function f. In the description can be found extra spaces and line breaks (see the examples) which, of course, can’t break key words int, if, return and numbers. The size of input data can’t exceed 100 bytes.

Output

Output a single number — the answer to the problem. If there’s no answer, output "-1" (without quotes).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input function uses division, which could lead to incorrect results due to the way division is handled in the program. Specifically, the `__div__` method in the `Num` class uses `op.div`, which in Python 3 is actually `__truediv__`, not `__floordiv__`. This means that division does not truncate towards zero as specified in the problem description, but instead performs floating-point division, which can lead to incorrect results when the result is converted back to an integer.

For example, consider the function:
```cpp
int f(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return f(n - 1) / 2;
}
```
If `f(n)` is called with `n = 1`, the function should return `0` because `1 / 2` should be `0` (integer division). However, the program will incorrectly handle this division, potentially leading to an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import re
import sys
import operator as op

(fin, fout) = (sys.stdin, sys.stdout)
MOD = 2 ** 15
make_op = lambda op: lambda s, o: Num(op(s.x, o.x) % MOD)
make_cmp = lambda op: lambda s, o: op(s.x, o.x)
class Num:

    def __init__(self, obj):
        self.x = obj.x if isinstance(obj, Num) else int(obj)
    __add__ = make_op(op.add)
    __sub__ = make_op(op.sub)
    __div__ = make_op(op.div)
    __mul__ = make_op(op.mul)
    __eq__ = make_cmp(op.eq)
    __lt__ = make_cmp(op.lt)
    __gt__ = make_cmp(op.gt)
n = int(fin.readline())
text = ''.join(fin.readlines())
for (pat, repl) in [('\\s', ''), ('return', 'return '), ('.*{(.*)}.*', '\\1'), ('(\\d+)', 'Num(\\1)'), ('(if.*?)(return)', '\\1:\\2'), (';', '\n\t')]:
    text = re.sub(pat, repl, text)
text = 'def F(n):\n\tn = Num(n)\n\t' + text
exec(compile(text.strip(), 'f**k', 'exec'))
cache = {}
f = lambda n: Num(cache[func_1(n)])
ans = -1
for i in range(0, MOD):
    t = cache[i] = Num(F(i))
    if func_1(t) == n:
        ans = i
print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer from the interval [0..32767].
def func_1(num):
    return num.x if isinstance(num, Num) else num
    #The program returns the integer value of `num` from the interval [0..32767], as `num` is not an instance of a custom class `Num` and thus the else clause is executed returning `num` directly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. If `num` is an instance of a custom class `Num`, it returns the attribute `x` of `num`. Otherwise, it returns `num` directly. The function assumes that `num` is either an integer within the interval [0..32767] or an instance of the `Num` class. If `num` is an integer, it is returned unchanged. If `num` is an instance of `Num`, it should have an attribute `x` which is also expected to be an integer within the interval [0..32767]. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either the integer value of `num` or the integer value of `num.x` if `num` is an instance of `Num`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
