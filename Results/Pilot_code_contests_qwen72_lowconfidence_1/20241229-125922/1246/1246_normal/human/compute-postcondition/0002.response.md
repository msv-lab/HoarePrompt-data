Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. If `num` is an instance of a custom class `Num`, it returns the attribute `x` of `num`. Otherwise, it returns `num` directly. The function assumes that `num` is either an integer within the interval [0..32767] or an instance of the `Num` class. If `num` is an integer, it is returned unchanged. If `num` is an instance of `Num`, it should have an attribute `x` which is also expected to be an integer within the interval [0..32767]. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned either the integer value of `num` or the integer value of `num.x` if `num` is an instance of `Num`. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `num` is not an integer or an instance of `Num`, the function will raise an error (e.g., `AttributeError` if `num` does not have an attribute `x`).
- The function does not validate that `num` is within the interval [0..32767] if `num` is an integer, nor does it validate that `num.x` is within the interval [0..32767] if `num` is an instance of `Num`.
- If `Num` is not defined or `num` is an instance of a different class, the function will not behave as expected.
