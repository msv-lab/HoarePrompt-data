The function processes a series of targets and shots. It takes as input the number of targets `n`, the x-coordinates and radii of these targets, the number of shots `m`, and the coordinates of the shots. The function then determines which targets have been hit by the shots and outputs the total number of unique targets hit (`w`) and a list `b` indicating the first shot that hit each target. If a target is not hit by any shot, the corresponding entry in `b` remains `-1`. The function assumes that no two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested, but they can touch each other. The function does not handle invalid input or edge cases where the input constraints are violated.
