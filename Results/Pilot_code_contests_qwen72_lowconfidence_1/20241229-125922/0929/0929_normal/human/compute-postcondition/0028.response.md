Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 1 or 2 if `b[d]` was not initially -1, otherwise `w` is 2 or 3, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged except `b[d]` is now `i + 1` if `b[d]` was initially -1, `d` is `a[u][2]` if `0 ≤ u < n` and `(x - a[u][0])² + y² ≤ a[u][1]², otherwise `d` remains unchanged.***
