Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `u` is `h`, `d` is `a[h][2]`. If \(0 \leq u < n\) and \((x - a[u][0])^2 + y^2 \leq a[u][1]^2\), and if `b[a[h][2]]` was -1, then `w` is incremented by 1 and `b[a[h][2]]` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `w` and `b[a[h][2]]` remain unchanged.***
