The code snippet `b[d] = i + 1` updates the value of the dictionary `b` at key `d` to `i + 1`. To determine the exact state, let's analyze the initial conditions and the code:

- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers.
- `w` is 0 or 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input.
- `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`.
- `u` is `h`.
- `d` is `a[u][2]`.

Given these conditions, the code `b[d] = i + 1` updates the dictionary `b` at the key `d` to the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 0 or 1, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`, `d` is `a[u][2]`, `b[d]` is `i + 1`.**
