The line of code `x, y = z()` executes the lambda function `z`, which reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and maps these parts to integers. The resulting integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`.

- `x` and `y` are now integers derived from the input.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `w` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input.**
