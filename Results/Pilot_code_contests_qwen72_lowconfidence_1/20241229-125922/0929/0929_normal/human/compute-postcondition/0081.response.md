The function `func` accepts the following parameters:

- `n`: An integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the number of targets.
- For each of the next `n` lines:
  - `x`: An integer (-2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4) representing the x-coordinate of the center of the target.
  - `r`: An integer (1 ≤ r ≤ 1000) representing the radius of the target.
- `m`: An integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of shots.
- For each of the next `m` lines:
  - `x`: An integer (-2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4) representing the x-coordinate of a shot.
  - `y`: An integer (-2·10^4 ≤ y ≤ 2·10^4) representing the y-coordinate of a shot.

No two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other.

The function returns the number of shots that hit at least one of the targets.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of targets `n`, the x-coordinates and radii of the targets, the number of shots `m`, and the coordinates of the shots. It returns the number of shots that hit at least one of the targets.**
