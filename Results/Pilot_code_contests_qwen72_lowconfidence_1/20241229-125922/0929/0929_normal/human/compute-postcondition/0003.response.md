The code `b = [-1] * n` attempts to create a list `b` of length `n` with all elements initialized to `-1`. However, since `n` is a string, this operation will raise a `TypeError` because the multiplication operator cannot be used between a list and a string.

Therefore, the code execution will stop, and no changes will be made to the existing state. The error occurs before any assignment to `b` takes place.

Output State: **`n` is a string from user input, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers. An error occurs due to the use of `[-1] * n` with `n` being a string.**
