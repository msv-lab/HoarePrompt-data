The value of `w` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `w` is incremented by 1, `u` is `h`, `d` is `a[h][2]`, `b[a[h][2]]` is `i + 1` if the condition was met.**
