The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since `w` was initially 0 or 1, it will now be 1 or 2 respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 1 or 2, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`, `d` is `a[u][2]`, `b[d]` is `i + 1`.**
