Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `u` is `h`, `d` is `a[h][2]`. If `b[a[h][2]]` was -1, then `w` is incremented by 1 and `b[a[h][2]]` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `w` and `b[a[h][2]]` remain unchanged.***
