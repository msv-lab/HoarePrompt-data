The code snippet `n = input()` assigns the value of user input to the variable `n`. Since the input is not specified, we assume it is a string at this point. The previous value of `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) is overwritten by the new input value. The values of `m` and the lambda function `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string from user input, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers.**
