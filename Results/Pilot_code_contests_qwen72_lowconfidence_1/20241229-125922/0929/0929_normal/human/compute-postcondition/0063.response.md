Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is updated to the first value returned by `z()`, `y` is updated to the second value returned by `z()`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is an integer such that `1 <= h < n`, `b` is updated such that for each valid index `u`, `b[a[u][2]]` is set to `i + 1`, `u` satisfies `0 <= u < n` and \((x - a[u][0])^2 + y^2 \leq a[u][1]^2\), `d` is `a[u][2]`. If `b[d]` was initially `-1`, then `b[d]` is now `i + 1` and `w` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b[d]` remains as it was and `w` remains unchanged.***
