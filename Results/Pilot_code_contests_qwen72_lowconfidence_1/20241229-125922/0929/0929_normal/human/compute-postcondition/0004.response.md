The code snippet `w = 0` initializes the variable `w` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

- `n` remains a string from user input.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `z` remains a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers.
- The error mentioned due to the use of `[-1] * n` with `n` being a string is not part of the current code snippet and thus remains unaffected.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is a string from user input, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 0.**
