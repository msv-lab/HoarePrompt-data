Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is the number of valid indices `u` (either `h - 1` or `h`) that satisfy `0 <= u < n` and `(x - a[u][0])**2 + y**2 <= a[u][1]**2` and for which `b[a[u][2]]` was initially -1, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `b` is updated such that for each valid index `u` where `b[a[u][2]]` was -1, `b[a[u][2]]` is set to `i + 1`.**
