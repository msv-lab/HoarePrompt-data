Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 0 or 1, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`. If 0 ≤ `u` < `n` and (`x` - `a[u][0]`)² + `y`² ≤ `a[u][1]`², then `d` is `a[u][2]`. If `b[d]` == -1, `w` is 1 or 2, and `b[d]` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, the values of `w` and `b` remain unchanged.***
