Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is updated to the first value returned by `z()`, `y` is updated to the second value returned by `z()`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is an integer such that `1 <= h < n`, `b` is updated such that for each valid index `u`, if the condition \((x - a[u][0])^2 + y^2 \leq a[u][1]^2\) is met and `b[a[u][2]]` was initially `-1`, then `b[a[u][2]]` is set to `i + 1` and `w` is incremented by 1. If the condition is not met or `b[a[u][2]]` was not `-1`, `b[a[u][2]]` remains unchanged. If the condition is met, `d` is equal to `a[u][2]`. If the condition is not met, `d` remains undefined.***
