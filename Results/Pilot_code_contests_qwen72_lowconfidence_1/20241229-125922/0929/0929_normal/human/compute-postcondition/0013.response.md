The code `b[d] = i + 1` updates the value of `b[d]` to `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `b[d]` was initially `-1`, and now it will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h - 1`, `0 <= u < n`, `(x - a[u][0])`, `d` is `a[u][2]`, and `b[d]` is `i + 1`.**
