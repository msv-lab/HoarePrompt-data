Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first value returned by `z()`, `y` is the second value returned by `z()`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is an integer such that `1 <= h < n`, `b[a[u][2]]` is updated to `i + 1` where `u` is either `h - 1` or `h`. If `b[d] == -1`, `w` is incremented by 1.***
