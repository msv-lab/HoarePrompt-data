The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `z` which reads input, splits it by whitespace, and maps the resulting strings to integers. This lambda function can be used to read multiple integer values from a single line of input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
- The values of `x` and `r` for each target, and `x` and `y` for each shot, are within specified ranges and follow the given constraints.

After defining the lambda function `z`, the values of `n`, `m`, and the input constraints remain unchanged. The lambda function `z` is now available for use to read input in the specified format.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers.**
