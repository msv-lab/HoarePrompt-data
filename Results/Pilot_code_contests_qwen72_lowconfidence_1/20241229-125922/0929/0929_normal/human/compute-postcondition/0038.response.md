The value of `w` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `w` is the number of valid indices `u` (either `h - 1` or `h`) that satisfy `0 <= u < n` and `(x - a[u][0])` plus 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])` and must satisfy `1 <= h < n`, the current value of `u` satisfies `0 <= u < n` and `(x - a[u][0])`, `d` is equal to `a[u][2]`, `b[d]` is equal to `i + 1`**
