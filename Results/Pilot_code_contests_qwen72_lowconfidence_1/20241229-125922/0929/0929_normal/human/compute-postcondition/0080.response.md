The code `print(' '.join(map(str, b)))` prints the list `b` as a space-separated string of its elements.

- The values of `n`, `m`, `z`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `b` is printed in its current state, which has been updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. Specifically, for each valid index `u` that satisfies the condition, `b[a[u][2]]` is set to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is the total number of valid indices `u` (either `h - 1` or `h`) that satisfy \(0 \leq u < n\) and \((x - a[u][0])^2 + y^2 \leq a[u][1]^2\) and `b[a[u][2]]` was initially `-1`, `b` is updated such that for each valid index `u` that satisfies the condition, `b[a[u][2]]` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is the iteration index, `i` is `int(n) - 1`, `b` is printed as a space-separated string of its elements.**
