The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `w` was 0, after executing `w += 1`, the new value of `w` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h - 1`, `0 <= u < n`, `(x - a[u][0])`, `d` is `a[u][2]`, and `b[d]` is `i + 1`.**
