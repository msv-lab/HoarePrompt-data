The code `b[d] = i + 1` updates the value of `b[d]` to `i + 1`. We need to consider the conditions under which `d` and `w` are updated:

- `d` is updated to `a[h][2]` if `0 ≤ h < n` and `(x - a[h][0])² + y² ≤ a[h][1]²`.
- `w` is updated to 1 or 2 if `b[d]` was initially -1 and `b[d]` is set to `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5.
- `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers.
- `w` is 0 or 1.
- `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input.
- `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`.
- `u` is `h`.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `d` is `a[h][2]` if `0 ≤ h < n` and `(x - a[h][0])² + y² ≤ a[h][1]², otherwise `d` remains unchanged.
- `w` is 1 or 2 if `b[d]` == -1 and `b[d]` is set to `i + 1`, otherwise `w` and `b` remain unchanged.

After executing `b[d] = i + 1`:
- `b[d]` is now `i + 1`.
- If `b[d]` was initially -1, then `w` is updated to 1 or 2.

The output state reflects these changes while maintaining all other initial conditions that are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 1 or 2 if `b[d]` was initially -1, otherwise `w` remains 0 or 1, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged except `b[d]` is now `i + 1`, `d` is `a[h][2]` if `0 ≤ h < n` and `(x - a[h][0])² + y² ≤ a[h][1]², otherwise `d` remains unchanged.**
