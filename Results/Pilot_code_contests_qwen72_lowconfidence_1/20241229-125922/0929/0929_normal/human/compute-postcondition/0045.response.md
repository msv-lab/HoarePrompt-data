Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `w` is the number of valid indices `u` (either `h - 1` or `h`) that satisfy `0 <= u < n` and `(x - a[u][0])`. If `b[d]` is -1, `w` is incremented by 1, `u` is the other value of `h - 1` or `h` that hasn't been used yet, `d` is `a[u][2]`, and `b[d]` is set to `i + 1`.***
