The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since `w` was initially 1 or 2 if `b[d]` was initially -1, or 0 or 1 otherwise, after the increment, `w` will be 2 or 3 if `b[d]` was initially -1, or 1 or 2 otherwise.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `z`, `x`, `y`, `h`, `u`, `a`, `b`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, `z` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it, and maps the results to integers, `w` is 2 or 3 if `b[d]` was initially -1, otherwise `w` is 1 or 2, `x` and `y` are integers derived from the input, `h` is the result of `p(a, [x])`, `u` is `h`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged except `b[d]` is now `i + 1`, `d` is `a[h][2]` if `0 ≤ h < n` and `(x - a[h][0])² + y² ≤ a[h][1]², otherwise `d` remains unchanged.**
