Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `x` is the first value returned by `z()`, `y` is the second value returned by `z()`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is an integer such that `1 <= h < n`. If `0 <= u < n` and `(x - a[u][0]) ** 2 + y ** 2 <= a[u][1] ** 2` for `u = h - 1` or `u = h`, then `b[a[u][2]]` is updated to `i + 1`. If `b[d] == -1` for the updated `d`, then `w` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `w` remain unchanged.***
