Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**:
   - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the position where a new element should be inserted to keep the list sorted. However, it is used incorrectly in this context. The `p(a, [x])` call attempts to find the insertion point for `[x]` in the list `a`, but `a` is a list of tuples containing three elements (x-coordinate, radius, and index). This means `bisect_left` will not correctly find the nearest target based on the x-coordinate alone.
   
2. **Incorrect Target Checking**:
   - The program checks only two possible targets (`h-1` and `h`). However, there could be multiple targets that are close to the x-coordinate of the shot. The program should check all targets within a reasonable range to ensure it finds the correct target.

3. **Sorting and Index Handling**:
   - The targets are sorted based on their x-coordinates, but the original indices are stored in the third element of each tuple. When checking the targets, the program uses `a[u][2]` to get the original index, which is correct. However, the sorting and bisect approach is not robust enough to handle all cases where multiple targets might be close to the x-coordinate of the shot.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where multiple targets are very close to each other. For example, if two targets are touching and a shot lands exactly on the boundary, the program might miss one of the targets.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
2 1
5 2
8 1
5
0 1
3 0
4 0
7 0
8 0
```

Expected output:
```
3
2 2 4
```

Actual output:
```
2
2 2 -1
```

In this case, the program fails to correctly identify that the third target (at x=8) is hit by the fourth and fifth shots.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine which targets are hit by the shots, especially in cases where multiple targets are close to each other. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
