Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where multiple targets have the same x-coordinate and the same radius. The problem statement guarantees that no two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other. However, the program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the closest target, which may not always select the correct target if there are multiple targets with the same x-coordinate. This can lead to incorrect identification of the first hit for a target.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
2 1
2 1
2
2 0
2 0
```

In this case, both targets are centered at x=2 with a radius of 1. The program might incorrectly identify the first hit for both targets, leading to an incorrect output.
