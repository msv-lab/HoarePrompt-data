You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Perhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has finished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.

Of course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, — that's what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.

As for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.

On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with n targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and the center of each circle is located on the Ox axis. At the last training session Valera made the total of m shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in the target), or "-1" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.

Input

The first line of the input file contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104), which is the number of targets. The next n lines contain descriptions of the targets. Each target is a circle whose center is located on the Ox axis. Each circle is given by its coordinate of the center x ( - 2·104 ≤ x ≤ 2·104) and its radius r (1 ≤ r ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that no two targets coincide, intersect or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other.

The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), which is the number of shots. Next m lines contain descriptions of the shots, which are points on the plane, given by their coordinates x and y ( - 2·104 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·104).

All the numbers in the input are integers. 

Targets and shots are numbered starting from one in the order of the input.

Output

Print on the first line a single number, the number of targets hit by Valera. Print on the second line for each of the targets the number of its first hit or "-1" (without quotes) if this number does not exist. Separate numbers with spaces.

        for u in (h - 1, h):
            if 0 <= u < n and (x - a[u][0]) ** 2 + y ** 2 <= a[u][1] ** 2:
                d = a[u][2]
                if b[d] == -1:
                    b[d] = i + 1
                    w += 1
    print(w)
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))


```
Output hints: The function processes a series of targets and shots. It takes as input the number of targets `n`, the x-coordinates and radii of these targets, the number of shots `m`, and the coordinates of the shots. The function then determines which targets have been hit by the shots and outputs the total number of unique targets hit (`w`) and a list `b` indicating the first shot that hit each target. If a target is not hit by any shot, the corresponding entry in `b` remains `-1`. The function assumes that no two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested, but they can touch each other. The function does not handle invalid input or edge cases where the input constraints are violated.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
