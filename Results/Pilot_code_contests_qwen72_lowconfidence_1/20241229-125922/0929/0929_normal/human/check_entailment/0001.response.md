Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple shots hit the same target. According to the problem description, the program should output the number of the first successful shot for each target. However, the current implementation of the program will update the `b` list with the latest shot index whenever a target is hit, which means it may overwrite the first successful shot with a later one if multiple shots hit the same target. This leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 1
5 2
10 1
5
0 1
1 3
3 0
4 0
4 0
```

Expected output:
```
2
3 3 -1
```

Actual output:
```
2
5 3 -1
```

In this case, the target at position 2 with radius 1 is hit by both the 3rd and 5th shots. The program incorrectly updates the first hit to the 5th shot instead of keeping the 3rd shot as the first successful hit.
