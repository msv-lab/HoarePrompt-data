### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Input:**
  - Number of targets `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).
  - For each target, the center coordinate `x` and radius `r` (-2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4, 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000).
  - Number of shots `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5).
  - For each shot, the coordinates `x` and `y` (-2·10^4 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·10^4).
- **Output:**
  - The number of targets hit.
  - For each target, the number of the first successful shot or "-1" if not hit.

#### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left as p

def func():
    z = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = input()
    a = [(z() + [i]) for i in range(n)]
    b = [-1] * n
    w = 0
    a.sort()
    for i in range(input()):
        x, y = z()
        
        h = p(a, [x])
        
        for u in (h - 1, h):
            if 0 <= u < n and (x - a[u][0]) ** 2 + y ** 2 <= a[u][1] ** 2:
                d = a[u][2]
                if b[d] == -1:
                    b[d] = i + 1
                    w += 1
        
    print(w)
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))
```

#### Key Points
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of targets `n` and the number of shots `m`.
   - It reads the target descriptions and stores them in a list `a` along with their indices.
   - It reads the shot descriptions and processes them.

2. **Sorting Targets:**
   - The targets are sorted based on their x-coordinates to facilitate efficient searching using binary search.

3. **Processing Shots:**
   - For each shot, the program uses binary search to find the closest target(s) to the shot.
   - It checks if the shot hits the target by comparing the distance from the shot to the target center with the target's radius.
   - If a target is hit and it hasn't been hit before, it updates the first hit index and increments the hit count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of targets hit.
   - It prints the first hit index for each target or "-1" if not hit.

#### Correctness Check
- **Target Sorting:**
  - The targets are sorted based on their x-coordinates, which is necessary for the binary search to work correctly.
- **Binary Search:**
  - The program uses binary search to find the closest target(s) to the shot, which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Hit Checking:**
  - The program correctly checks if a shot hits a target by comparing the distance to the target's radius.
- **First Hit Tracking:**
  - The program tracks the first hit for each target and ensures that each target is counted only once.
- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the number of targets hit and the first hit index for each target.

#### Conclusion
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly processes the input, performs the necessary checks, and produces the correct output.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
