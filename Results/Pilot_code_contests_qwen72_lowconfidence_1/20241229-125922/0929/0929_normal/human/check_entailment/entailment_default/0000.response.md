Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the binary search (`bisect_left`) used to find the potential target for a given shot does not guarantee that the closest target is selected, especially when multiple targets are close to each other. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 1
5 2
10 1
5
0 1
1 3
3 0
4 0
4 0
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3 3 -1
```

Actual Output from the Provided Code:
```
2
3 3 -1
```

This particular example works correctly, but consider a different scenario where the targets are closer together:

### Input:
```
3
2 1
4 1
6 1
5
3 0
3 1
3 2
5 0
5 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
1 3 -1
```

### Actual Output from the Provided Code:
```
2
1 2 -1
```

In this case, the shot at `(3, 1)` should hit the second target (index 1), but the code incorrectly assigns it to the first target (index 0). This is because the binary search (`bisect_left`) does not account for the possibility that a shot could be equidistant or closer to a different target.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when multiple targets are close to each other. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
