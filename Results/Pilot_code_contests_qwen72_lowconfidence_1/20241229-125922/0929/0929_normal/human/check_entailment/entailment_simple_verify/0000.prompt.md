You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Perhaps many have heard that the World Biathlon Championship has finished. Although our hero Valera was not present at this spectacular event himself and only watched it on TV, it excited him so much that he decided to enroll in a biathlon section.

Of course, biathlon as any sport, proved very difficult in practice. It takes much time and effort. Workouts, workouts, and workouts, — that's what awaited Valera on his way to great achievements in biathlon.

As for the workouts, you all probably know that every professional biathlete should ski fast and shoot precisely at the shooting range. Only in this case you can hope to be successful, because running and shooting are the two main components of biathlon. Valera has been diligent in his ski trainings, which is why he runs really fast, however, his shooting accuracy is nothing to write home about.

On a biathlon base where Valera is preparing for the competition, there is a huge rifle range with n targets. Each target have shape of a circle, and the center of each circle is located on the Ox axis. At the last training session Valera made the total of m shots. To make monitoring of his own results easier for him, one rather well-known programmer (of course it is you) was commissioned to write a program that would reveal how many and which targets Valera hit. More specifically, for each target the program must print the number of the first successful shot (in the target), or "-1" if this was not hit. The target is considered hit if the shot is inside the circle or on its boundary. Valera is counting on you and perhaps, thanks to you he will one day win international competitions.

Input

The first line of the input file contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104), which is the number of targets. The next n lines contain descriptions of the targets. Each target is a circle whose center is located on the Ox axis. Each circle is given by its coordinate of the center x ( - 2·104 ≤ x ≤ 2·104) and its radius r (1 ≤ r ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that no two targets coincide, intersect or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other.

The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), which is the number of shots. Next m lines contain descriptions of the shots, which are points on the plane, given by their coordinates x and y ( - 2·104 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·104).

All the numbers in the input are integers. 

Targets and shots are numbered starting from one in the order of the input.

Output

Print on the first line a single number, the number of targets hit by Valera. Print on the second line for each of the targets the number of its first hit or "-1" (without quotes) if this number does not exist. Separate numbers with spaces.

                    b[d] = i + 1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where multiple targets have the same x-coordinate and the same radius. The problem statement guarantees that no two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other. However, the program uses a binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the closest target, which may not always select the correct target if there are multiple targets with the same x-coordinate. This can lead to incorrect identification of the first hit for a target.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
2 1
2 1
2
2 0
2 0
```

In this case, both targets are centered at x=2 with a radius of 1. The program might incorrectly identify the first hit for both targets, leading to an incorrect output.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, representing the number of targets. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and r, where -2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4 is the x-coordinate of the center of the target, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000 is the radius of the target. m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of shots. Each of the next m lines contains two integers x and y, where -2·10^4 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·10^4, representing the coordinates of a shot. No two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
