n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4; each of the n circles is defined by its center's x-coordinate and radius, where -2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000, and no two circles coincide, intersect, or are nested; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5; each of the m shots is defined by its x and y coordinates, where -2·10^4 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·10^4.
