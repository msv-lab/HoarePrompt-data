n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, representing the number of targets. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and r, where -2·10^4 ≤ x ≤ 2·10^4 is the x-coordinate of the center of the target, and 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000 is the radius of the target. m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of shots. Each of the next m lines contains two integers x and y, where -2·10^4 ≤ x, y ≤ 2·10^4, representing the coordinates of a shot. No two targets coincide, intersect, or are nested into each other, but they can touch each other.
