Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It simulates the game played by Takahashi and Aoki, considering their optimal strategies. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`), the starting position of the piece (`sr`, `sc`), and the strings representing the moves (`S` and `T`).

2. **Optimal Strategy Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the moves in reverse order, which is a clever approach to simulate the optimal strategy.
   - For each move, it updates the allowed range (`AO`) for the piece's position based on Aoki's moves.
   - It then checks if Takahashi's move would cause the piece to go out of bounds.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program ensures that the piece's position remains within the grid boundaries by updating the allowed range (`AO`).
   - It checks if the piece is outside the allowed range after each move, which indicates that the piece has been removed from the grid.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all moves, the program checks if the piece's final position is within the allowed range.
   - If the piece is within the allowed range, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it correctly simulates the game's logic. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
