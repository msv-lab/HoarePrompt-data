You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).

Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N. Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

* First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
* Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.



Here, to move the piece in the direction of `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.

Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps. Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid. Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

Constraints

* 2 \leq H,W \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq s_r \leq H
* 1 \leq s_c \leq W
* |S|=|T|=N
* S and T consists of the four kinds of letters `L`, `R`, `U` and `D`.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It simulates the game played by Takahashi and Aoki, considering their optimal strategies. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the grid dimensions (`H`, `W`), the starting position of the piece (`sr`, `sc`), and the strings representing the moves (`S` and `T`).

2. **Optimal Strategy Simulation**:
   - The program iterates through the moves in reverse order, which is a clever approach to simulate the optimal strategy.
   - For each move, it updates the allowed range (`AO`) for the piece's position based on Aoki's moves.
   - It then checks if Takahashi's move would cause the piece to go out of bounds.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program ensures that the piece's position remains within the grid boundaries by updating the allowed range (`AO`).
   - It checks if the piece is outside the allowed range after each move, which indicates that the piece has been removed from the grid.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all moves, the program checks if the piece's final position is within the allowed range.
   - If the piece is within the allowed range, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, and it correctly simulates the game's logic. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

            elif T[i] == 'R':

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is a list of four integers where each element is updated based on the characters in `S` and `T`, `flag` is 0 or 1. If `N` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `AO` remains `[1, W, 1, H]` and `flag` remains 0. If the loop executes, `AO` is updated such that `AO[0]` and `AO[1]` represent the minimum and maximum column indices, respectively, and `AO[2]` and `AO[3]` represent the minimum and maximum row indices, respectively, considering the movements defined by `S` and `T`. If at any point `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, `flag` is set to 1, and the loop breaks.
    if (AO[0] > sc or AO[1] < sc or AO[2] > sr or AO[3] < sr) :
        flag = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is a list of four integers where each element is updated based on the characters in `S` and `T`, `flag` is 0 or 1. If `AO[0] > s_c` or `AO[1] < s_c` or `AO[2] > s_r` or `AO[3] < s_r`, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.
    if (flag == 0) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is a list of four integers where each element is updated based on the characters in `S` and `T`. If `AO[0]` is not greater than `s_c`, `AO[1]` is not less than `s_c`, `AO[2]` is not greater than `s_r`, and `AO[3]` is not less than `s_r`, `flag` remains 0 and 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `flag` is set to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values `H`, `W`, `N`, `s_r`, `s_c`, `S`, and `T` from the user. It initializes a list `AO` with the values `[1, W, 1, H]` and a flag `flag` set to 0. The function then iterates through the characters of the string `S` and `T` in reverse order. For each character in `T`, it updates the bounds of `AO` based on the direction ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D'). For each character in `S`, it adjusts the current position within the bounds defined by `AO`. If at any point the bounds defined by `AO` become invalid (i.e., `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`), the flag is set to 1 and the loop breaks. After the loop, the function checks if the starting position `(s_r, s_c)` is within the bounds defined by `AO`. If it is, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly to the console. Edge cases include when `N` is 0, in which case the loop does not execute, and the function directly checks if the starting position is within the initial bounds. If the input strings `S` or `T` contain characters other than 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D', the behavior is undefined.
