The code snippet `H, W, N = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `H`, `W`, and `N` respectively. This means the values of `H`, `W`, and `N` are updated to the new input values.

Output State: **`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`; `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'.**
