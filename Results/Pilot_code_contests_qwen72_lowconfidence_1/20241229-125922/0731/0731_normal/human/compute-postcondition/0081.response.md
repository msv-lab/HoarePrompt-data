Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `flag` is 0 or 1, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is `N-3`. If `S[i] == 'L'`, `AO[0]` is incremented by 1, while `AO[1]`, `AO[2]`, and `AO[3]` remain unchanged. If `S[i] != 'L'` and `S[i] == 'R'` and `i != N - 1`, `AO[1]` is set to `min(W, AO[1] + 1) - 1`, and if `T[i] == 'L'`, `AO[1]` is set to `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`. If `T[i] == 'R'`, `AO[0]` is set to `max(1, AO[0] - 1)`. If `T[i] == 'U'`, `AO[3]` is set to `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`. If `T[i] == 'D'`, `AO[2]` is set to `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`. If `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, `flag` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `AO` unchanged. If `S[i] != 'R'` and `S[i] == 'U'` and `i != N - 1`, `AO[2]` is set to `AO[2] + 1`. If `S[i] != 'R'` and `S[i] == 'D'`, `AO[3]` is set to `AO[3] - 1`. If `i == N - 1`, the state of `AO` and other variables remains unchanged.***
