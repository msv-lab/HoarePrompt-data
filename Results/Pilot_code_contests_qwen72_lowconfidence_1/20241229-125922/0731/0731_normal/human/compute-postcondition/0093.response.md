Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is a list of four integers where each element is updated based on the characters in `S` and `T`. If `AO[0]` is not greater than `s_c`, `AO[1]` is not less than `s_c`, `AO[2]` is not greater than `s_r`, and `AO[3]` is not less than `s_r`, `flag` remains 0 and 'YES' is printed to the console. Otherwise, `flag` is set to 1.***
