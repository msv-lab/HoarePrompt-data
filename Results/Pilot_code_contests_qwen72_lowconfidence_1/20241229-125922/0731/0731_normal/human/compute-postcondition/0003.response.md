`T` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input from the user and assigns it to `T`. The values of `H`, `W`, `N`, `s_r`, `s_c`, and `S` remain unchanged. Since `T` is expected to be a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', the new value of `T` is a string input by the user.

Output State: **`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'; `T` is a string input by the user.**
