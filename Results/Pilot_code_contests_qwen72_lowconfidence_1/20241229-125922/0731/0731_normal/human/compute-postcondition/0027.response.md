Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]`, `flag` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0, and `i` is `N-1`. If `i` is not `N - 1`, and `T[i]` is 'L', the current character in `T` at index `i` is 'L'. If `T[i]` is 'R', 'U', or 'D', the if block is executed. Otherwise, the else block is executed. If `i` is `N - 1`, the else block is not executed. Additionally, `S[i]` is not 'L', and the current value of `S[i]` is 'R'***
