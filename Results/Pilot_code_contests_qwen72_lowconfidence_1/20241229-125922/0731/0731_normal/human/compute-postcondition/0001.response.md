The code snippet assigns new values to `sr` and `sc` by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers. The variables `H`, `W`, `N`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`; `S` and `T` are strings of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'. `sr` and `sc` are updated with the new input values.**
