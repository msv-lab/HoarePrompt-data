Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `flag` is 0 or 1, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is `N-2`, and `AO` is a list. If `T[i]` is 'L', `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`, and `AO[0]`, `AO[2]`, and `AO[3]` remain unchanged. If `T[i]` is 'R', `AO[0]` is the maximum of 1 and `AO[0] - 1`, `AO[1]` is `W`, `AO[2]` is `1`, and `AO[3]` is `H`. If `T[i]` is 'U', `AO[3]` is updated to `min(H, AO[3] + 1)`. If `T[i]` is 'D', `AO[2]` is updated to `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`. If `AO[0]` is greater than `AO[1]` or `AO[2]` is greater than `AO[3]`, `flag` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
