Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `AO` is `[1, W, 1, H]`, `flag` is 0, `N` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `i` is not `N - 1`. Additionally, `T[i]` is not 'R' and `T[i]` is not 'U'.***
