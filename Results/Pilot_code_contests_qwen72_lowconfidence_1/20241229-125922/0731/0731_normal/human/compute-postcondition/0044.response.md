Output State: **`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `flag` is 0 or 1, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is `N-2`, `AO[1]` is `min(W, AO[1] + 1)`, `AO[0]`, `AO[2]`, and `AO[3]` remain unchanged.**
