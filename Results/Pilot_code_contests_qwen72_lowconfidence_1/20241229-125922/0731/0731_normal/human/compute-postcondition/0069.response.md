Postcondition: ***`H`, `W`, and `N` are integers from input, `s_r` and `s_c` are integers such that 1 ≤ `s_r` ≤ `H` and 1 ≤ `s_c` ≤ `W`, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D', `T` is a string input by the user, `flag` is 0 or 1, `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is `N-3`. If `T[i] == 'D'`, then `AO[2]` is set to `max(1, AO[2] - 1)`. If `AO[0] > AO[1]` or `AO[2] > AO[3]`, `flag` is set to 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `AO` unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `AO` and other variables remains as previously modified according to the rules specified for `S[i]` and `T[i]`. If `T[i] != 'D'`, the state of `AO` and other variables remains as previously modified according to the rules specified for `S[i]` and `T[i]`.***
