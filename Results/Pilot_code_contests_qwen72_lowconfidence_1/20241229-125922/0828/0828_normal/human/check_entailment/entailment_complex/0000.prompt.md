You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: During the last Sereja's Codesecrof round the server crashed many times, so the round was decided to be made unrated for some participants. 

Let's assume that n people took part in the contest. Let's assume that the participant who got the first place has rating a1, the second place participant has rating a2, ..., the n-th place participant has rating an. Then changing the rating on the Codesecrof site is calculated by the formula <image>.

After the round was over, the Codesecrof management published the participants' results table. They decided that if for a participant di < k, then the round can be considered unrated for him. But imagine the management's surprise when they found out that the participants' rating table is dynamic. In other words, when some participant is removed from the rating, he is removed from the results' table and the rating is recalculated according to the new table. And of course, all applications for exclusion from the rating are considered in view of the current table.

We know that among all the applications for exclusion from the rating the first application to consider is from the participant with the best rank (the rank with the minimum number), for who di < k. We also know that the applications for exclusion from rating were submitted by all participants.

Now Sereja wonders, what is the number of participants to be excluded from the contest rating, and the numbers of the participants in the original table in the order of their exclusion from the rating. Pay attention to the analysis of the first test case for a better understanding of the statement.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, - 109 ≤ k ≤ 0). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — ratings of the participants in the initial table.

Output

Print the numbers of participants in the order in which they were removed from the table. Print the initial numbers of the participants, that is, the numbers that the participants had in the initial table.

Examples

Input

5 0
5 3 4 1 2

Input

5 5 1 7 5 1 2 4 9 2


Output

7

9

Note

Consider the first test sample. 

  1. Initially the sequence of the contest participants' ratings equals [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]. You can use this sequence to calculate the sequence of rating changes: [0, -9, -13, 8, 14]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered first.
  2. As soon as the second place winner is out from the ratings, the participants' rating sequence will equal [5, 4, 1, 2]. By this sequence you can count the new sequence of rating changes: [0, -8, 2, 6]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered. Initially this participant won third place.
  3. The new rating sequence equals [5, 1, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, -1, 1]. The second place participant's application is taken into consideration, initially this participant won the fourth place.
  4. The new rating sequence equals [5, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, 0]. No more applications will be considered. 



Thus, you should print 2, 3, 4.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and -10^9 ≤ k ≤ 0; a1, a2, ..., an are integers representing the ratings of the participants, where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, k = rints()
    a, ans, s = rints(), [], 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k:
            ans.append(i + 1)
            n -= 1
        else:
            s += a[i] * (i - len(ans))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - `n` will be the initial `n` minus the number of times the condition `s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k` was true.
    #   - `s` will be the sum of all `a[i] * (i - len(ans))` for each `i` where the condition was false.
    #   - `ans` will be a list of integers `i + 1` for each `i` where the condition was true.
    #   - `a` remains unchanged.
    #   - `k` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Output State:
    print('\n'.join(map(str, ans)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input. It processes these inputs to generate a list `ans` of integers. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it checks if a certain condition involving `s`, `n`, `i`, `len(ans)`, and `a[i]` is less than `k`. If the condition is true, it appends `i + 1` to `ans` and decrements `n`. If the condition is false, it updates the sum `s`. After processing, it prints the elements of `ans` on separate lines. The final state of the program is that `n` is reduced by the number of times the condition was true, `s` is updated based on the condition being false, `ans` contains the indices where the condition was true, and `a` and `k` remain unchanged.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
