Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range**:
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (`for i in range(1, n)`). However, according to the problem description, the ratings are 1-indexed, meaning the first participant is at index 0. The loop should iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `if s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k:` is not correctly implementing the rating change calculation. The correct formula for the rating change \( d_i \) for the \( i \)-th participant is:
     \[
     d_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j - (n - i) \cdot a_i
     \]
     The current condition does not match this formula.

3. **Updating `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is intended to keep track of the sum of rating changes. However, the way it is updated in the program does not correctly reflect the sum of rating changes for the remaining participants.

4. **Handling Exclusion**:
   - When a participant is excluded, the program should recompute the rating changes for the remaining participants. The current implementation does not correctly handle this re-computation.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Compute the initial rating changes for all participants.
2. Identify the participant with the smallest index whose rating change \( d_i \) is less than \( k \).
3. Exclude this participant and recompute the rating changes for the remaining participants.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more participants can be excluded.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda: [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, k = rints()
    a = rints()
    
    # Function to compute the rating changes
    def compute_rating_changes(a):
        n = len(a)
        rating_changes = [0] * n
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            rating_changes[i] = prefix_sum - (n - i - 1) * a[i]
            prefix_sum += a[i]
        return rating_changes
    
    ans = []
    while True:
        rating_changes = compute_rating_changes(a)
        excluded = None
        for i in range(n):
            if rating_changes[i] < k:
                excluded = i
                break
        if excluded is None:
            break
        ans.append(excluded + 1)
        a.pop(excluded)
        n -= 1
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, ans)))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **compute_rating_changes**: This function computes the rating changes for all participants using the correct formula.
- **Main Loop**: The main loop continues until no more participants can be excluded. In each iteration, it:
  - Computes the rating changes.
  - Finds the first participant whose rating change is less than \( k \).
  - Excludes this participant and updates the list of ratings.
  - Appends the excluded participant's index (1-based) to the answer list.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the indices of the excluded participants in the order they were excluded.

This corrected program ensures that the rating changes are correctly computed and that participants are excluded in the correct order, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
