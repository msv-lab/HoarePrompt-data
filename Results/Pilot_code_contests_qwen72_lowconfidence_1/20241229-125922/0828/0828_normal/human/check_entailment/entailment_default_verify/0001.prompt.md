You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: During the last Sereja's Codesecrof round the server crashed many times, so the round was decided to be made unrated for some participants. 

Let's assume that n people took part in the contest. Let's assume that the participant who got the first place has rating a1, the second place participant has rating a2, ..., the n-th place participant has rating an. Then changing the rating on the Codesecrof site is calculated by the formula <image>.

After the round was over, the Codesecrof management published the participants' results table. They decided that if for a participant di < k, then the round can be considered unrated for him. But imagine the management's surprise when they found out that the participants' rating table is dynamic. In other words, when some participant is removed from the rating, he is removed from the results' table and the rating is recalculated according to the new table. And of course, all applications for exclusion from the rating are considered in view of the current table.

We know that among all the applications for exclusion from the rating the first application to consider is from the participant with the best rank (the rank with the minimum number), for who di < k. We also know that the applications for exclusion from rating were submitted by all participants.

Now Sereja wonders, what is the number of participants to be excluded from the contest rating, and the numbers of the participants in the original table in the order of their exclusion from the rating. Pay attention to the analysis of the first test case for a better understanding of the statement.

Input

The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, - 109 ≤ k ≤ 0). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — ratings of the participants in the initial table.

Output

Print the numbers of participants in the order in which they were removed from the table. Print the initial numbers of the participants, that is, the numbers that the participants had in the initial table.

Examples

Input

5 0
5 3 4 1 2


Output

2
3
4


Input

10 -10
5 5 1 7 5 1 2 4 9 2


Output

2
4
5
7
8
9

Note

Consider the first test sample. 

  1. Initially the sequence of the contest participants' ratings equals [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]. You can use this sequence to calculate the sequence of rating changes: [0, -9, -13, 8, 14]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered first.
  2. As soon as the second place winner is out from the ratings, the participants' rating sequence will equal [5, 4, 1, 2]. By this sequence you can count the new sequence of rating changes: [0, -8, 2, 6]. According to the problem statement, the application of the participant who won the second place will be considered. Initially this participant won third place.
  3. The new rating sequence equals [5, 1, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, -1, 1]. The second place participant's application is taken into consideration, initially this participant won the fourth place.
  4. The new rating sequence equals [5, 2], the new sequence of rating changes equals [0, 0]. No more applications will be considered. 



Thus, you should print 2, 3, 4.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    (n, k) = rints()
    (a, ans, s) = (rints(), [], 0)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k:
            ans.append(i + 1)
            n -= 1
        else:
            s += a[i] * (i - len(ans))
    print('\n'.join(map(str, ans)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the sum `s` and checking the condition `if s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k:` is flawed. This condition does not accurately reflect the formula for rating changes described in the problem statement.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Rating Changes**:
   - The program uses a simplified formula `s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans))` to check if a participant should be excluded. However, this formula does not match the given formula for rating changes, which is more complex and involves the sum of products of ratings and their positions.

2. **Handling of Exclusions**:
   - When a participant is excluded, the program does not correctly recalculate the rating changes for the remaining participants. The sum `s` is not updated correctly, and the indices are not adjusted properly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial list of ratings might have duplicates or very large values. For example, if all participants have the same rating, the program might incorrectly exclude participants.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
5 0
5 3 4 1 2
```
The correct output should be:
```
2
3
4
```
However, the provided program might produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly calculate the rating changes after each exclusion.

To ensure the program is correct, it needs to:
1. Accurately calculate the rating changes using the given formula.
2. Recalculate the rating changes after each exclusion.
3. Handle edge cases and ensure the logic is robust.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input. It processes these inputs to generate a list `ans` of integers. For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it checks if a certain condition involving `s`, `n`, `i`, `len(ans)`, and `a[i]` is less than `k`. If the condition is true, it appends `i + 1` to `ans` and decrements `n`. If the condition is false, it updates the sum `s`. After processing, it prints the elements of `ans` on separate lines. The final state of the program is that `n` is reduced by the number of times the condition was true, `s` is updated based on the condition being false, `ans` contains the indices where the condition was true, and `a` and `k` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
