Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Rating Changes**:
   - The problem statement requires calculating the rating change \( d_i \) using the formula \( d_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j - (n - i) \cdot a_i \).
   - The program attempts to calculate the rating change using a simplified formula, which does not match the required formula. Specifically, the program uses `s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k`, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Exclusions**:
   - The program incorrectly updates the total number of participants `n` and the sum `s` without properly recalculating the rating changes after each exclusion.
   - The logic for updating `s` and `n` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program prints the indices of the participants to be excluded, but it does not handle the recalculation of the rating changes correctly, leading to potentially wrong indices being printed.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the solution, you need to:

1. Calculate the initial rating changes \( d_i \) for all participants.
2. Identify the participant with the smallest index whose \( d_i \) is less than \( k \).
3. Remove this participant from the list and recalculate the rating changes for the remaining participants.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until no more participants meet the condition \( d_i < k \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    rints = lambda: [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, k = rints()
    a = rints()
    
    # Initialize the list of rating changes
    d = []
    for i in range(n):
        d.append(sum(a[:i]) - (n - i - 1) * a[i])
    
    # List to store the indices of participants to be excluded
    ans = []
    
    while True:
        # Find the participant with the smallest index whose d_i < k
        for i in range(n):
            if d[i] < k:
                ans.append(i + 1)
                # Remove the participant and recalculate the rating changes
                a.pop(i)
                d.pop(i)
                n -= 1
                for j in range(i, n):
                    d[j] = sum(a[:j]) - (n - j - 1) * a[j]
                break
        else:
            break
    
    # Print the indices of the excluded participants
    print('\n'.join(map(str, ans)))

# Call the function
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The initial rating changes \( d_i \) are calculated using the formula \( d_i = \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_j - (n - i) \cdot a_i \).

2. **Exclusion Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the participants to find the one with the smallest index whose \( d_i \) is less than \( k \).
   - Once such a participant is found, they are removed from the list, and the rating changes are recalculated for the remaining participants.
   - This process continues until no more participants meet the condition \( d_i < k \).

3. **Output**:
   - The indices of the excluded participants are printed in the order they were excluded.

This corrected implementation ensures that the program follows the problem description accurately.
