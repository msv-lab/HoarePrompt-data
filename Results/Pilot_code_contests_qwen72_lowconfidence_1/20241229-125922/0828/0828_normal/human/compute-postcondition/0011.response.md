The code snippet provided is `ans.append(i + 1)`. This line of code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is updated to `s + a[i] * (i - len(ans))` if the condition was not met, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is `n - 1` if the condition was met, otherwise `n` remains unchanged.
- `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended if the condition was met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the code snippet `ans.append(i + 1)` is executed, it implies that the condition was met. Therefore, the following changes occur:

- `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended.
- `n` is `n - 1` because the condition was met.
- `i` is `i + 1` (this part of the initial state is independent of the condition).

The value of `s` remains unchanged because the condition was met, and the update to `s` only happens if the condition was not met.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended.**
