The code defines a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from the standard input, splits the line into multiple strings based on whitespace, and then converts each string into an integer, returning a list of these integers.

The definition of the lambda function does not execute the function itself; it only sets up the function for later use. Therefore, no variables are updated, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and -10^9 ≤ k ≤ 0; a1, a2, ..., an are integers representing the ratings of the participants, where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9. A lambda function `rints` is defined.**
