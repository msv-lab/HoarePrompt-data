Postcondition: ***If `s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k`, then `s` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended. Otherwise, `s` is `s + a[i] * (i - len(ans))`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.***
