The code snippet `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Given the initial state and the previous execution of `ans.append(i + 1)`, which indicates that the condition was met, we know that `n` was already decremented by 1. Therefore, this additional decrement further reduces `n` by 1.

- `s` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is `n - 1` from the previous state, and now it is further reduced by 1, making it `n - 2`.
- `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n - 2`, `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended.**
