Postcondition: ***Given `s`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `ans` as defined in the precondition, if the expression `(s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)))` is less than `k`, then `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended, and `n` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + a[i] * (i - len(ans))`, and the expression `(s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)))` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
