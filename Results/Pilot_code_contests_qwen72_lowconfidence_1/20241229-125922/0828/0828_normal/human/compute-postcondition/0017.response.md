The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` could be either `n - 2` or `n` depending on the condition, but now it is `n - 1` regardless of the previous condition. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended.**
