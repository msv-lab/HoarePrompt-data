Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1. If `s - (n - i - len(ans) - 1) * a[i] * (i - len(ans)) < k`, then `n` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended. Otherwise, `n` is either decremented by 2 or remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated with `i + 1` appended if the condition was true or remains unchanged otherwise. Additionally, `s` is updated to `s + a[i] * (i - len(ans))` in the else part.***
