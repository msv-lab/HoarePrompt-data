To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n)`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(-10^9 \leq k \leq 0\).
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the ratings of the participants.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `s` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `n` is greater than 1. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

**Adjusted State:**
- `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(-10^9 \leq k \leq 0\), and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers representing the ratings of the participants.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `s` is 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(-10^9 \leq k \leq 0\), and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers representing the ratings of the participants, `ans` is an empty list, `s` is 0.**
