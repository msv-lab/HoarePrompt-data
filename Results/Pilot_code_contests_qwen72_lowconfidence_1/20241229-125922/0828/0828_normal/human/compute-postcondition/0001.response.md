The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by the lambda function `rints()`. The lambda function `rints` is expected to read input and convert it into a tuple of two integers. The constraints for `n` and `k` remain the same, and the ratings of the participants (a1, a2, ..., an) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and -10^9 ≤ k ≤ 0, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `rints()`, a1, a2, ..., an are integers representing the ratings of the participants, where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.**
