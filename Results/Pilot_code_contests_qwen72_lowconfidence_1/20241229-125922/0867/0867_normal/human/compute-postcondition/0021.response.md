The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one. The conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold for some i and j.

- When `y > 0`, the function returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)`.
- When `y ≤ 0`, the function returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `x` and `y`, and return the sum of specific operations involving elements from arrays `a` and `b` based on the value of `y`. If no valid `i` exists, it returns 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns the sum of specific bitwise operations involving elements from arrays `a` and `b` based on the value of `y`. If no valid `i` exists, it returns 0.**
