Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `na` is a positive integer, `nb` is a positive integer, `cnt` is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y > 0`, or the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y ≤ 0`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.**
