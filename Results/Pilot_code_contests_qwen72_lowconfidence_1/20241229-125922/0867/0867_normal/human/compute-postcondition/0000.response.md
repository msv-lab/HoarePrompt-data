The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `x` and `y`, which remain as integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, under the given conditions.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, such that the conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb hold for some i and j; `cnt` is 0.**
