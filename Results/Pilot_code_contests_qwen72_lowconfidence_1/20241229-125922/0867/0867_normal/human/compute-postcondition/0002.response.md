Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, such that the conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb hold for some i and j; `cnt` is 0, `na` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i + x` is in the range (0, nb).**
