Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `na` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)` and `y > 0`, `cnt` is updated to `func_1(a[2] << y & b[x]) + func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])`. If `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)` and `y <= 0`, `cnt` is updated to `func_1(a[2] & b[x] << -y) + func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)`. If `i + x` is not within the range `[0, nb)` and `y > 0`, `cnt` remains as `func_1(a[2] << y & b[x])`. If `i + x` is not within the range `[0, nb)` and `y <= 0`, `cnt` remains as `func_1(a[2] & b[x] << -y)`.***
