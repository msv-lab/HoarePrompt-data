The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to `func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)`. Since `y <= 0` (as per the initial condition when `y <= 0`), the bitwise left shift operation is performed on `b[1 + x]` by `-y` positions, and the result is ANDed with `a[1]` before being passed to `func_1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one.
- `cnt` is now `func_1(a[1] << y & b[x]) + func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)` if `y > 0`.
- `cnt` is now `func_1(a[1] & b[x] << -y) + func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`.
- `na` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `cnt` is `func_1(a[1] & b[x] << -y) + func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`, or `cnt` is `func_1(a[1] << y & b[x]) + func_1(a[1] & b[1 + x] << -y)` if `y > 0`, `na` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
