Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, and computes a sum based on bitwise operations involving elements from two arrays, `a` and `b`. The function iterates over the indices of array `a` and checks if the corresponding shifted index in array `b` is within bounds. If `y > 0`, it performs a left shift on elements of `a` by `y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `b` shifted by `x`. If `y â‰¤ 0`, it performs a right shift on elements of `b` by `-y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `a` shifted by `x`. The result of each operation is passed to `func_1`, and the results are summed up. The function returns the total sum. If no valid indices exist (e.g., `na` is 0 or the shifts cause out-of-bounds access), the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `na` is 0, when `x` or `y` cause out-of-bounds access, and when `y` is negative. **
