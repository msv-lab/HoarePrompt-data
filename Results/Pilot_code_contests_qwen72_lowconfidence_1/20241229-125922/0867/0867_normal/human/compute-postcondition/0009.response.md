According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `na`. If `i` is less than `na`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `na` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `na` must still be greater than 1.

Additionally, the state of `x` and `y` does not change between iterations, but the condition for `cnt` needs to be re-evaluated with the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- `na` must be greater than 1.
- The condition for `cnt` is re-evaluated with `i = 1`. If `1 + x` is in the range (0, nb), then `cnt` is either `func_1(a[1] << y & b[x])` if `y > 0`, or `cnt` is `func_1(a[1] & b[x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`.

State: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `cnt` is either `func_1(a[1] << y & b[x])` if `y > 0`, or `cnt` is `func_1(a[1] & b[x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`, `na` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
