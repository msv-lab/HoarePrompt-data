The code snippet modifies the value of `cnt` by adding the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` to it. Let's analyze the impact:

- `cnt` is incremented by the result of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])`.
- `a[i]` is shifted left by `y` bits, and then bitwise AND (`&`) is applied with `b[i + x]`.
- The result of this operation is passed to `func_1`, and the return value of `func_1` is added to `cnt`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `na` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `i + x` is in the range (0, nb).
- The current value of `y` is greater than 0.

After executing the code:
- `cnt` is now equal to the result of `func_1(a[0] << y & b[x])`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `na`, and `nb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `cnt` is `func_1(a[0] << y & b[x])`, `na` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `i + x` is in the range (0, nb), and the current value of `y` is greater than 0.**
