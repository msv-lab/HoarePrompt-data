Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `cnt` is 0, `na` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `i + x` is in the range (0, nb), then `cnt` is either `func_1(a[0] << y & b[x])` if `y > 0`, or `cnt` is `func_1(a[0] & b[x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`.***
