To analyze the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the changes introduced by the code:

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one.
- `na` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- If `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)`, and `y > 0`, `cnt` is `func_1(a[2] << y & b[x]) + func_1(a[2] << y & b[2 + x])`.
- If `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)` and `y <= 0`, `cnt` is `func_1(a[2] & b[x] << -y) + func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)`.
- If `i + x` is not within the range `[0, nb)`, `cnt` remains as `func_1(a[2] << y & b[x])` if `y > 0`, or `func_1(a[2] & b[x] << -y)` if `y <= 0`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the value of `i`**: `i` is 2.
2. **Check the condition for `i + x`**: We need to determine if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)`.
   - If `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)`, the code will execute.
   - If `i + x` is not within the range `[0, nb)`, the code will not modify `cnt`.

3. **Evaluate the expression `a[i] & b[i + x] << -y`**:
   - `a[i]` is `a[2]`.
   - `b[i + x]` is `b[2 + x]`.
   - `<< -y` shifts `b[2 + x]` left by `-y` positions (which is equivalent to shifting right by `|y|` positions).

4. **Call `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)` is called.
   - The result of this function call is added to `cnt`.

### Updated State:
- `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `na` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `cnt + func_1(a[2] & b[2 + x] << -y)` if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged.**
