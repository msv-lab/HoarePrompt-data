The code snippet updates the variable `cnt` by adding the result of the function `func_1` applied to the expression `a[i] & b[i + x] << -y`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one.
   - `cnt` is initially 0.
   - `na` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `i + x` is in the range (0, nb).
   - `y` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `a[i]` accesses the element at index `i` of list `a`.
   - `b[i + x]` accesses the element at index `i + x` of list `b`.
   - `b[i + x] << -y` performs a left bit shift on `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions. Since `y` is less than or equal to 0, `-y` is non-negative.
   - `a[i] & (b[i + x] << -y)` performs a bitwise AND operation between `a[i]` and the result of the left bit shift.
   - `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` calls the function `func_1` with the result of the bitwise AND operation as the argument.
   - `cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` increments `cnt` by the value returned from `func_1`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `cnt` is updated to `cnt + func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)`.
   - All other variables (`x`, `y`, `na`, `i`, `nb`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `cnt` is `func_1(a[0] & b[x] << -y)`, `na` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `i + x` is in the range (0, nb), and `y` is less than or equal to 0.**
