The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a modified version of `x`. The modification involves a series of bitwise operations that effectively mix the bits of `x` in a specific pattern. The final state of the program is that the function returns an integer value which is the result of these bitwise operations. The function does not have any side effects and only modifies the input integer `x` through these operations. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers and zero, by treating them as their two's complement binary representation.
