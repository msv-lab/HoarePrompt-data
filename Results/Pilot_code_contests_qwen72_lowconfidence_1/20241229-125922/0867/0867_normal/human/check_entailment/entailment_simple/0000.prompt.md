You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

(na, ma) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
a = [int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2) for i in range(0, na)]
(nb, mb) = [int(buf) for buf in stdin.readline().strip().split()]
b = [int(stdin.readline().strip()[::-1], 2) for i in range(0, nb)]
(ans, xx, yy) = (0, 0, 0)
for x in range(1 - na, nb):
    for y in range(1 - ma, mb):

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
