Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Bitwise Operations and Integer Representation**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations to represent and manipulate the tables. Specifically, it converts the rows of the tables into integers using base-2 conversion (`int(row[::-1], 2)`). This approach is efficient but can lead to issues if not handled correctly.
   - The `func_1` function is used to count the number of set bits (1s) in an integer. However, the implementation of `func_1` is overly complex and may not be necessary. A simpler approach using built-in functions like `bin(x).count('1')` would be more straightforward and easier to verify.

2. **Handling Shifts**:
   - The program iterates over all possible shifts `(x, y)` within the range `1 - na` to `nb` for `x` and `1 - ma` to `mb` for `y`. This is correct in terms of the range of shifts to consider.
   - However, the way the program calculates the overlap factor using bitwise operations is not straightforward and may not correctly handle all edge cases. For example, the bitwise shifting and masking operations might not correctly account for the boundaries of the tables, especially when `y` is negative.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `i + x` is within the range `[0, nb)`, which is correct. However, it does not explicitly check if `j + y` is within the range `[0, mb)`, which is also required by the problem description.
   - The condition `if y > 0:` and the corresponding bitwise operations might not correctly handle the case when `y` is negative, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the shift `(x, y)` with the maximum overlap factor, which is correct. However, if there are multiple shifts with the same maximum overlap factor, the program does not specify how it handles this situation. According to the problem description, any of these shifts should be acceptable, but the program should ensure that it always prints one of them.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description due to the complex and potentially incorrect handling of bitwise operations and boundary conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect. To make it correct, the bitwise operations should be simplified, and the boundary conditions should be explicitly checked to ensure that the overlap factor is calculated correctly for all possible shifts.
