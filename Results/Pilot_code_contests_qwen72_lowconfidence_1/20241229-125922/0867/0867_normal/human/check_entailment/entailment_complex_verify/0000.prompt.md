You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You've got two rectangular tables with sizes na × ma and nb × mb cells. The tables consist of zeroes and ones. We will consider the rows and columns of both tables indexed starting from 1. Then we will define the element of the first table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as ai, j; we will define the element of the second table, located at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column, as bi, j. 

We will call the pair of integers (x, y) a shift of the second table relative to the first one. We'll call the overlap factor of the shift (x, y) value:

<image>

where the variables i, j take only such values, in which the expression ai, j·bi + x, j + y makes sense. More formally, inequalities 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb must hold. If there are no values of variables i, j, that satisfy the given inequalities, the value of the sum is considered equal to 0. 

Your task is to find the shift with the maximum overlap factor among all possible shifts.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers na, ma (1 ≤ na, ma ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the first table. Then na lines contain ma characters each — the elements of the first table. Each character is either a "0", or a "1".

The next line contains two space-separated integers nb, mb (1 ≤ nb, mb ≤ 50) — the number of rows and columns in the second table. Then follow the elements of the second table in the format, similar to the first table.

It is guaranteed that the first table has at least one number "1". It is guaranteed that the second table has at least one number "1".

Output

Print two space-separated integers x, y (|x|, |y| ≤ 109) — a shift with maximum overlap factor. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` only considers the overlap in the vertical direction (rows) but does not handle the horizontal direction (columns) correctly. Additionally, the code does not account for all possible shifts (x, y) as required by the problem. For example, the code does not handle cases where the second table is shifted to the left or up, which could still result in valid overlaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a modified version of `x`. The modification involves a series of bitwise operations that effectively mix the bits of `x` in a specific pattern. The final state of the program is that the function returns an integer value which is the result of these bitwise operations. The function does not have any side effects and only modifies the input integer `x` through these operations. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers and zero, by treating them as their two's complement binary representation.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, such that the conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb hold for some i and j.

                cnt += func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])
            else:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `na` is a positive integer, `nb` is a positive integer, `cnt` is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y > 0`, or the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y ≤ 0`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y > 0`, or the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y ≤ 0`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, and computes a sum based on bitwise operations involving elements from two arrays, `a` and `b`. The function iterates over the indices of array `a` and checks if the corresponding shifted index in array `b` is within bounds. If `y > 0`, it performs a left shift on elements of `a` by `y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `b` shifted by `x`. If `y ≤ 0`, it performs a right shift on elements of `b` by `-y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `a` shifted by `x`. The result of each operation is passed to `func_1`, and the results are summed up. The function returns the total sum. If no valid indices exist (e.g., `na` is 0 or the shifts cause out-of-bounds access), the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `na` is 0, when `x` or `y` cause out-of-bounds access, and when `y` is negative.
