Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the second table is entirely to the left or above the first table, specifically when `x` or `y` are negative and cause out-of-bounds access. The function `func_2` checks if `i + x` is within the bounds of `nb`, but it does not check if `j + y` is within the bounds of `mb` when performing the bitwise operations. This oversight means that the function could potentially access out-of-bounds indices in the arrays, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors. Additionally, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where `y` is negative correctly. When `y` is negative, the function should perform a right shift on elements of `b` by `-y` positions, but the current implementation performs a left shift on `b` by `-y` positions, which is incorrect. These issues mean that the program does not meet the specification for every potential case.
