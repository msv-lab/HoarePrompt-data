Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` only considers the overlap in the vertical direction (rows) but does not handle the horizontal direction (columns) correctly. Additionally, the code does not account for all possible shifts (x, y) as required by the problem. For example, the code does not handle cases where the second table is shifted to the left or up, which could still result in valid overlaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
