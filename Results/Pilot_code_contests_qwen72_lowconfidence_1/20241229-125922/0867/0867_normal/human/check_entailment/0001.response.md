Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program lacks the following critical components:

1. **Reading Input**: The program does not read the input tables and their dimensions from `stdin`. The problem description specifies that the input is provided in a specific format, but the program does not handle this input at all.

2. **Overlap Factor Calculation**: The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the overlap factor for a given shift `(x, y)`, but it does not correctly handle the boundaries of the tables. For example, it assumes that `a` and `b` are lists of integers, but they are actually lists of strings representing the tables. Additionally, the bitwise operations used in `func_1` are not appropriate for this problem, as they do not correctly compute the dot product of the overlapping regions of the tables.

3. **Finding the Maximum Overlap Factor**: The program does not include any logic to iterate over all possible shifts `(x, y)` and find the one with the maximum overlap factor. This is a crucial part of the problem, and without it, the program cannot produce the correct output.

4. **Output**: The program does not print the result, which is required according to the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
