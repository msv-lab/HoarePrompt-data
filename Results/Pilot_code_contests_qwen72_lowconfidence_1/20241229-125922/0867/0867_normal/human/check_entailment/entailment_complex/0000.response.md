Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the overlap factor calculation for all possible shifts. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code manages the bitwise shifts and the bitwise AND operations within the `func_2` function.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Bitwise Shifts and Overlap Calculation:**
   - The code uses bitwise shifts to align the bits of the two tables, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the shift causes the bits to go out of bounds.
   - For example, when `y > 0`, the code performs a left shift on `a[i]` by `y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with `b[i + x]`. However, if `y` is greater than the number of bits in `a[i]`, the left shift will result in a value that is not aligned correctly with `b[i + x]`.
   - Similarly, when `y â‰¤ 0`, the code performs a right shift on `b[i + x]` by `-y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with `a[i]`. If `-y` is greater than the number of bits in `b[i + x]`, the right shift will also result in a misalignment.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle the case where the shift causes the tables to overlap partially or not at all. For example, if `x` or `y` are such that the shifted table `b` does not overlap with `a` at all, the code should return 0 for the overlap factor, but it may not handle this correctly due to the bitwise operations.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```
The expected output is:
```
0 1
```
However, if we analyze the code, it may not correctly handle the case where `y > 0` and the left shift causes the bits to misalign. For example, if `y = 2` and the bit length of `a[i]` is 2, shifting `a[i]` by 2 positions will result in a value that is not correctly aligned with `b[i + x]`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential shifts, leading to incorrect overlap factor calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
