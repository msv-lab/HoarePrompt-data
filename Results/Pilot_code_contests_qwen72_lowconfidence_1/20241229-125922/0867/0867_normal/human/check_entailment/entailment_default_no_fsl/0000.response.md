Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle the overlap calculation for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` has a logical flaw in how it calculates the overlap factor when `y` is negative. According to the problem description, the overlap factor should be calculated for all valid indices where the expressions `ai, j Â· bi + x, j + y` make sense. However, the current implementation of `func_2` incorrectly shifts the elements of `b` when `y` is negative, which leads to incorrect overlap calculations.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
01
10
00
2 3
001
111
```

The expected output is `(0, 1)`, which the program correctly outputs. However, consider a different input where `y` is negative:

```
3 3
000
010
000
1 1
1
```

The expected output is `(-1, -1)`, but the current implementation of `func_2` will not correctly handle this case because it shifts the elements of `b` incorrectly when `y` is negative.

To fix this, the function `func_2` should correctly handle the bitwise operations for both positive and negative `y` values, ensuring that the overlap factor is calculated correctly for all valid indices.
