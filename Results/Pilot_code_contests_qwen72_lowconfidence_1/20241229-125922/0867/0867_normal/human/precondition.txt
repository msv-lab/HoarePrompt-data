The provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def max_overlap_factor(na, ma, a, nb, mb, b):` where `na`, `ma`, `nb`, and `mb` are integers representing the dimensions of the tables `a` and `b`, and `a` and `b` are 2D lists of characters ('0' or '1') representing the tables.
