    #The program returns the value of `x` which is `(x & 18446744073709551615) + (x >> 32 & 18446744073709551615)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a modified version of `x`. The modification involves a series of bitwise operations that effectively mix the bits of `x` in a specific pattern. The final state of the program is that the function returns an integer value which is the result of these bitwise operations. The function does not have any side effects and only modifies the input integer `x` through these operations. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers and zero, by treating them as their two's complement binary representation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, such that the conditions 1 ≤ i ≤ na, 1 ≤ j ≤ ma, 1 ≤ i + x ≤ nb, 1 ≤ j + y ≤ mb hold for some i and j.

            else:
                cnt += func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are integers representing the shift of the second table relative to the first one, `na` is a positive integer, `nb` is a positive integer, `cnt` is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y > 0`, or the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y ≤ 0`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of `func_1(a[i] << y & b[i + x])` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y > 0`, or the sum of `func_1(a[i] & b[i + x] << -y)` for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < na` and `i + x` is in the range `[0, nb)` when `y ≤ 0`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `na` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, and computes a sum based on bitwise operations involving elements from two arrays, `a` and `b`. The function iterates over the indices of array `a` and checks if the corresponding shifted index in array `b` is within bounds. If `y > 0`, it performs a left shift on elements of `a` by `y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `b` shifted by `x`. If `y ≤ 0`, it performs a right shift on elements of `b` by `-y` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with the corresponding element in `a` shifted by `x`. The result of each operation is passed to `func_1`, and the results are summed up. The function returns the total sum. If no valid indices exist (e.g., `na` is 0 or the shifts cause out-of-bounds access), the function returns 0. Edge cases include when `na` is 0, when `x` or `y` cause out-of-bounds access, and when `y` is negative.
