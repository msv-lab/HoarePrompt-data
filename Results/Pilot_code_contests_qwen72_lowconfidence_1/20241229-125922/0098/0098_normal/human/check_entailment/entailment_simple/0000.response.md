Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then, for each test case, reads an odd integer `n` within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 199).

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is defined to compute the minimum length of the side of the square in which the 2n-gon can be embedded.
   - The formula used in the function is `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`.

3. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` is derived from geometric properties of regular polygons and the embedding conditions.
   - For a regular 2n-gon, the minimum side length of the square that can contain it is determined by the distance between the farthest points of the 2n-gon when it is optimally placed within the square. This distance is given by the formula mentioned.
   - The formula correctly calculates the required side length of the square for any odd integer `n` within the specified range.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case with a precision of 9 decimal places using `print('%.9f' % func_1(n))`.
   - This ensures that the output meets the requirement of having an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 199) correctly. The formula and the logic are valid for all odd integers in this range.

Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the correct output for all valid inputs, it meets the problem description and is therefore correct.
