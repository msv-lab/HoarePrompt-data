The function `func_8` takes a list `l` as input, where each element in the list is either a dictionary or an object that has a key or attribute accessible via the `getKey` function. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the values returned by `getKey` for each element. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any element in `l` does not have a valid key or attribute for `getKey`, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error.
