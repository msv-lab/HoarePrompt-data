The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It redirects the standard input to read from the file `input.txt` and the standard output to write to the file `output.txt`. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. If `input.txt` does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will raise an `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError`. Similarly, if `output.txt` cannot be opened for writing, the function will also raise an `IOError`.
