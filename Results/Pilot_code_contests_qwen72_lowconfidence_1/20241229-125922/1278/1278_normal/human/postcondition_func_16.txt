The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Specifically, the function handles the following cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For `n` greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function checks divisibility by all integers of the form `6k ± 1` (where `k` is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 1.
- The function correctly identifies 2 and 3 as prime numbers.
- The function efficiently checks for primality by only considering potential divisors of the form `6k ± 1`, which covers all possible prime divisors.
- The function does not explicitly handle negative integers, but since the initial check ensures `n` is greater than 1, negative values are implicitly handled by returning `False`.
