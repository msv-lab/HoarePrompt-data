The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The contents of this list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`, which is not provided. If `func_3()` raises an exception, `func_5` will also raise that exception. If `func_3()` returns an iterable other than a list, `func_5` will convert it to a list before returning.
