The function `func_15` takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are non-negative integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is greater than 0. The function computes and returns `res`, which is `x^y % p`. The function effectively calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is modified to `x % p`, `y` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The final value of `res` is the result of the modular exponentiation. The function handles edge cases where `y` is 0, returning 1, and ensures that the result is always within the range `[0, p-1]`.
