You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a ≥ x and b ≥ y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:

  * Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y. 



Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains five integers a, b, x, y and n (1 ≤ a, b, x, y, n ≤ 10^9). Additional constraint on the input: a ≥ x and b ≥ y always holds.

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

Example

Input


7
10 10 8 5 3
12 8 8 7 2
12343 43 4543 39 123212
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000000
10 11 2 1 5
10 11 9 1 10


Output


70
77
177177
999999999000000000
999999999
55
10

Note

In the first test case of the example, you need to decrease b three times and obtain 10 ⋅ 7 = 70.

In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease a one time, b one time and obtain 11 ⋅ 7 = 77.

In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease a five times and obtain 5 ⋅ 11 = 55.

In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease b ten times and obtain 10 ⋅ 1 = 10.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it handles the reduction of `a` and `b` to minimize their product. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block where `max(a1, b1) > n` is not correctly implemented. The program incorrectly calculates the final values of `a` and `b` in some cases.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10 10 8 5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
70
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a different value because it incorrectly handles the reduction of `a` and `b`.

The correct approach should be to first reduce the larger of `a - x` and `b - y` until `n` operations are exhausted or the constraints are met, and then reduce the other variable if necessary. The current implementation does not handle this logic correctly in all cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 20 : This function prints the values of the given arguments to a specified stream, typically `sys.stdout`, with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function accepts `*args` (any number of arguments of any type) and `+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
