You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a ≥ x and b ≥ y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:

  * Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y. 



Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains five integers a, b, x, y and n (1 ≤ a, b, x, y, n ≤ 10^9). Additional constraint on the input: a ≥ x and b ≥ y always holds.

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

Example

Input


7
10 10 8 5 3
12 8 8 7 2
12343 43 4543 39 123212
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000000
10 11 2 1 5
10 11 9 1 10


Output


70
77
177177
999999999000000000
999999999
55
10

Note

In the first test case of the example, you need to decrease b three times and obtain 10 ⋅ 7 = 70.

In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease a one time, b one time and obtain 11 ⋅ 7 = 77.

In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease a five times and obtain 5 ⋅ 11 = 55.

In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease b ten times and obtain 10 ⋅ 1 = 10.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
