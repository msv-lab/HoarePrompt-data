The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input, which is intended to represent the number of test cases `t`. The function then returns this integer. According to the return postconditions, the integer should be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. However, the function does not enforce this constraint, so the returned value could be outside this range if the input is invalid.
