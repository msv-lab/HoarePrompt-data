The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. It reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. Edge cases include scenarios where the user provides no input (an empty string is returned), or where the input contains special characters or multiple lines (the entire input up to the first newline character is returned).
