You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a ≥ x and b ≥ y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:

  * Choose either a or b and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of a cannot become less than x, and value of b cannot become less than y. 



Your task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains five integers a, b, x, y and n (1 ≤ a, b, x, y, n ≤ 10^9). Additional constraint on the input: a ≥ x and b ≥ y always holds.

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of a and b (a ⋅ b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.

Example

Input


7
10 10 8 5 3
12 8 8 7 2
12343 43 4543 39 123212
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1
1000000000 1000000000 1 1 1000000000
10 11 2 1 5
10 11 9 1 10


Output


70
77
177177
999999999000000000
999999999
55
10

Note

In the first test case of the example, you need to decrease b three times and obtain 10 ⋅ 7 = 70.

In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease a one time, b one time and obtain 11 ⋅ 7 = 77.

In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease a five times and obtain 5 ⋅ 11 = 55.

In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease b ten times and obtain 10 ⋅ 1 = 10.
Program:
```
def func_20(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
