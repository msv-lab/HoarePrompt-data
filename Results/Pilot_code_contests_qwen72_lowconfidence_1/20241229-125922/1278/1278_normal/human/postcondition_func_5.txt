`func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000 and the stack size to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins executing it. The function itself does not return any value. After `func_6` concludes, the new thread continues to run independently, potentially affecting the program state depending on what `main` does. The main thread that called `func_6` will continue its execution immediately after starting the new thread.
