The function `func_16` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the variable `y` is guaranteed to be 0, and `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the edge case where either `x` or `y` is 0, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0.
