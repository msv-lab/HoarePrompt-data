The code snippet `b1 = b - y` assigns the value of `b - y` to the variable `b1`. Based on the initial state, `b` and `y` are updated by `func_3()`, but their specific values are not provided. However, since `b1` is directly derived from these updated values, we can express `b1` in terms of `b` and `y`.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer**
