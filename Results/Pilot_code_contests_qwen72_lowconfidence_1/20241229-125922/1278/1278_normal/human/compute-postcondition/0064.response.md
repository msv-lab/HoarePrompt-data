The code snippet provided impacts the variable `b2` by assigning it the value of `a * (b - n)`. The variables `a1`, `b1`, and `a2` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but their values depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`, which might be updated by `func_3()`. However, since the exact changes made by `func_3()` are not specified, we can only describe the effect of the given code snippet on `b2`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

The code snippet:
```
b2 = a * (b - n)
```

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`
- `b2` is `a * (b - n)`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer**
