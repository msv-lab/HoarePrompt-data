The function `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called, which passes the minimum value between `a2` and `b2` to `func_20`. This does not change the values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, or `n` directly. However, since `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and assuming `func_3()` modifies these variables, their values might change indirectly through the call to `func_3()` within `func_20`.

Given that the specific implementation of `func_3()` and `func_20()` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`. However, we can assume that these variables are updated in some way.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a1` remains `a - x` (with `a` and `x` possibly updated).
- `a2` remains `x * (a + b - n - x)` (with `a`, `b`, `x`, and `n` possibly updated).
- `b1` remains `b - y` (with `b` and `y` possibly updated).
- `b2` remains `a * (b - n)` (with `a`, `b`, and `n` possibly updated).
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()` (the exact new values are not known).

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`, `b1` is `b - y`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer**.
