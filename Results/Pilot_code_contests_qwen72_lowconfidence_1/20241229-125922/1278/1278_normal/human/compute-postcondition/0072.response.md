Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`. If `min(a1, b1) >= n`, then `func_1()` must return a positive integer, and if `a < b`, `func_20((a - n) * b)` is called; otherwise, `func_20((b - n) * a)` is called. If `min(a1, b1) < n`, and if `max(a1, b1) == n`, then if `a1 > b1`, `func_20(x * b)` is called; otherwise, `func_20(y * a)` is called. If `max(a1, b1) > n`, then if `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called; otherwise, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called. If `max(a1, b1) <= n`, then if `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called; otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.***
