The code assigns the value of `b * (a - n)` to `b2`. Based on the initial state:

- `a` is `a_new`
- `b` is `b_new`
- `n` is `n_new`

So, `b2` is calculated as `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is `a - x`, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`.
Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`**
