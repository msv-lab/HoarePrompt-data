The function `func_20` is called with the argument `min(a2, b2)`. This means the value of `min(a2, b2)` is passed to `func_20`, and the function's execution will depend on its definition, which is not provided here. However, since the function call does not modify the global state or return a value that affects the variables in the current scope, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_20` has been called.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, `max(a1, b1) != n`, `max(a1, b1) > n`, `a1 >= b1`, `a2 = y * (a + b - n - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` has been called.**
