To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the conditions and the loop structure provided.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The loop condition is `for _ in range(func_1())`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_1()` returns a positive integer. The loop counter `_` is not used within the loop, so it does not affect the state directly.
2. **State Update**: After each iteration, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by calling `func_3()`. This means that these variables will be different in each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1()` must return a positive integer. This is the only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to continue.
- **State Adjustment**: Since the loop counter `_` is not used, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the result of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns a positive integer, the loop will execute again. The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` will be updated by `func_3()` at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- The loop will execute if `func_1()` returns a positive integer.

State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer**.
