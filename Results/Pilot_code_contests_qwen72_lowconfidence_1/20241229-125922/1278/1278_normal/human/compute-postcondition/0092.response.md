The provided code snippet updates the value of `a2` based on the current values of `x`, `b`, `n`, and `a1`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: `a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `a2 = x * (b - (n - a1))` calculates the new value of `a2`.
   - We need to substitute the known values and expressions into this equation.

3. **Substitution**:
   - `a1` is given as `a - x`.
   - Therefore, `a2 = x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`.

4. **Simplification**:
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses: `b - (n - (a - x))` becomes `b - n + a - x`.
   - So, `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`.

5. **Output State**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `a1`, and `b1` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.
   - The new value of `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`**.
