To determine the output state, we need to follow the given code and its impact on the variables. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a1` is `a - x`
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
   - `b1` is `b - y`

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   a2 = y * (a - (n - b1))
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The value of `a2` is calculated using the current values of `y`, `a`, `n`, and `b1`.
   - `b1` is already defined as `b - y`.

4. **Substitute `b1` in the Expression:**
   - `a2 = y * (a - (n - (b - y)))`
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     - `a2 = y * (a - (n - b + y))`
     - `a2 = y * (a - n + b - y)`
     - `a2 = y * (a + b - n - y)`

5. **Final Expression for `a2`:**
   - `a2 = y * (a + b - n - y)`

6. **Output State:**
   - `a1` remains `a - x`
   - `b1` remains `b - y`
   - `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`
   - All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`) are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**
