The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `end` to the `file`. If `end` is not specified in `kwargs`, it defaults to a newline character (`'\n'`). Additionally, `kwargs` is modified by removing the key `'end'` if it was present.

Let's break down the changes:

- `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))`:
  - If `kwargs` contains the key `'end'`, its value is written to `file`, and `'end'` is removed from `kwargs`.
  - If `kwargs` does not contain the key `'end'`, the default value `'\n'` is written to `file`.

- The state of `args` remains unchanged.
- The state of `sep` remains unchanged.
- The state of `file` remains unchanged, except for the content written to it.
- The state of `flush` remains unchanged.
- The state of `at_start` remains unchanged.
- `kwargs` is modified by removing the key `'end'` if it was present.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (excluding 'sep' and 'file' if they were present) with `'end'` removed if it was present, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `True`. Each element in `args` has been written to `file` as a string, separated by `sep` if `args` contains more than one element, and the value of `end` (or `'\n'` if `end` was not in `kwargs`) has been written to `file`.**
