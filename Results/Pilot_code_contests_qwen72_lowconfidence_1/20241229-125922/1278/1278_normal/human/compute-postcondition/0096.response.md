The code snippet provided is:

```
b2 = b * (a - n)
```

This operation multiplies the value of `b` by the result of the expression `(a - n)` and assigns the outcome to `b2`.

Given the Initial State:
- `a2` is now `x * (a - n + b - y)`.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`) remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.

The calculation for `b2` does not affect the values of `a2`, `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, or `b1`. It only introduces a new variable `b2` which is the product of `b` and `(a - n)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, all other variables (`a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`) remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.**
