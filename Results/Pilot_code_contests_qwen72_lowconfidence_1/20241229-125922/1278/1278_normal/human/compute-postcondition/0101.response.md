Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `min(a1, b1) >= n`:
- If `a < b`, `func_20` is called with the argument `(a - n) * b`.
- Otherwise, `func_20` is not called, and the values of `a1`, `b1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.

If `min(a1, b1) < n`:
- If `max(a1, b1) == n`:
  - If `a1 > b1`, `func_20(x * b)` is called.
  - Otherwise, `func_20(y * a)` is called.
- If `max(a1, b1) > n`:
  - If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
  - Otherwise, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
- If `max(a1, b1) <= n`:
  - If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.
  - Otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.***

This postcondition summarizes the final state of the program variables and the conditions under which different functions are called based on the values of `a1` and `b1` relative to `n`.
