Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `a < b`, `func_20` is called with the argument `(a - n) * b`. Otherwise, `func_20` is not called, and the values of `a1`, `b1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.***
