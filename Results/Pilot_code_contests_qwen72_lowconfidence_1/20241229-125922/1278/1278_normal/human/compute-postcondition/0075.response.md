The code assigns the values returned by `func_3()` to the variables `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`. Since the initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, these variables will now hold the new values returned by `func_3()`. The condition that `func_1()` must return a positive integer remains unaffected as this line of code does not involve `func_1()`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
