The code snippet calls `func_20((a - n) * b)`. To determine the impact, we need to consider the initial state and the potential changes:

- `a1` is defined as `a - x`.
- `b1` is defined as `b - y`.
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

Given this, the expression `(a - n) * b` is passed to `func_20()`. Since the specifics of `func_20()` are not provided, we assume it processes its argument and returns a value. However, the problem does not specify what `func_20()` does, so we can only note that it has been called with the given argument.

### Impact Analysis:
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, but their new values are not specified.
- The expression `(a - n) * b` is computed and passed to `func_20()`.
- The call to `func_20()` may return a value, but since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output.

### Updated Variables:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- `a1` and `b1` are not directly affected by the code snippet, but their definitions depend on the updated values of `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`.

### Output State:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_20((a - n) * b)` is called.**
