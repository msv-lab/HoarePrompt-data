Functionality: ** This function prints the values of the given arguments to a specified stream, typically `sys.stdout`, with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function accepts `*args` (any number of arguments of any type) and `**kwargs` (optional parameters such as `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush`). After execution, the state is as follows:
- The arguments in `args` have been converted to strings and written to the specified `file` stream, separated by the `sep` string (defaulting to a single space).
- A string specified by `end` (defaulting to a newline character) is appended after the last value.
- If `flush` is `True`, the file buffer is flushed.
- The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` if they were present.
- The original `args` tuple remains unchanged.
- The function does not return any value. **

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the file except the `end` character.
- If `file` is not writable, a `TypeError` or `IOError` might occur, which is not handled by the function.
- If `flush` is `True` but `file` does not support the `flush` method, a `TypeError` might occur, which is also not handled by the function.
