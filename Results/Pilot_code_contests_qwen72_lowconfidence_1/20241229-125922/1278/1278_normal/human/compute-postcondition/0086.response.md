The value of `b2` is calculated as `a * (b - n)`. Given that `a`, `b`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, their exact values are not specified, but they are used in this calculation. The other variables (`a1`, `b1`, `a2`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`.
Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`**
