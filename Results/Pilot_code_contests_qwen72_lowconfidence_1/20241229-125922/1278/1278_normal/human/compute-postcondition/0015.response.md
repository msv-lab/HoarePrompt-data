The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. The state of the variables is updated accordingly, but the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `end`, `flush`, `at_start`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (excluding 'sep' and 'file' if they were present), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False, `at_start` is `False`, the next `x` is the third element in `args` and will be written to `file` as a string, and the separator `sep` has been written to `file`**.
