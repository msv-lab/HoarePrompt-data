Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer. If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`. Otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`.***
