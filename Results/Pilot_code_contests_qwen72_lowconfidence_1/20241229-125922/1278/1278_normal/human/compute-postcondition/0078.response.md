The code snippet provided updates the value of `b1` by subtracting `y` from `b`. Given that `a1` is `a - x`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, we need to consider the new values of `b` and `y` after the function call.

Since `func_3()` updates `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`, these variables will have new values after the function is called. However, without knowing the specific implementation of `func_3()`, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`. Therefore, we can only express the changes in terms of the new values.

The new value of `b1` is `b - y`, where `b` and `y` are the new values returned by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`**
