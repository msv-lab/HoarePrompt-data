To solve this, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`

Given Code:
```python
a2 = x * (a - (n - b1))
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `a2` is being assigned a new value.
   - The expression involves `x`, `a`, `n`, and `b1`.

2. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - `b1` is defined as `b - y`.
   - The expression for `a2` becomes: `a2 = x * (a - (n - (b - y)))`.

3. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Simplify the inner part of the expression: `n - (b - y) = n - b + y`.
   - So, the expression for `a2` simplifies to: `a2 = x * (a - (n - b + y))`.
   - Further simplify: `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`.

4. **Update the Output State:**
   - `a2` is now `x * (a - n + b - y)`.
   - All other variables (`a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`) remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`**.
