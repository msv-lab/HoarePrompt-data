Initial State:
- `a1` remains `a - x`
- `b1` remains `b - y`
- `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`
- `b2` is `b * (a - n)`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`

Code Snippet:
```python
func_20(min(a2, b2))
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. `a2` is calculated as `y * (a + b - n - y)`.
2. `b2` is calculated as `b * (a - n)`.
3. `min(a2, b2)` is computed to find the smaller value between `a2` and `b2`.
4. The function `func_20` is called with the result of `min(a2, b2)` as its argument.

Impact on Variables:
- The values of `a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain as they were in the initial state.
- The function `func_20` is called with the minimum value between `a2` and `b2`, but since the return value of `func_20` is not assigned to any variable, no further changes occur to the variables.

Output State:
**`a1` remains `a - x`, `b1` remains `b - y`, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**.
