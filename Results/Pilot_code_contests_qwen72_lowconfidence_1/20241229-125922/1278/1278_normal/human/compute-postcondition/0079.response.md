The function `func_20` is called with the argument `(a - n) * b`. The initial state specifies that `a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `b1` is `b - y`. However, the specific values returned by `func_3()` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` after `func_3()` is called.

Given this, the only clear impact of the code snippet is that `func_20` is called with the argument `(a - n) * b`. The return value of `func_20` and its side effects are not specified, so we assume no changes to the variables unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `func_20` has been called with the argument `(a - n) * b`.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `func_20` has been called with the argument `(a - n) * b`**.
