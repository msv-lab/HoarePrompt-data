To address the given task, let's break down the impact of the code on the program step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a1` is `a - x`
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
   - `b1` is `b - y`
   - `func_1()` must return a positive integer

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   func_20(y * a)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `y * a`.
   - The values of `a` and `y` are used in this calculation. Since `a` and `y` were updated by `func_3()`, their current values are what will be used.
   - The function `func_20` itself does not modify any global variables or return any values (assuming it does not have side effects).

4. **Output State**:
   - The values of `a1`, `b1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.
   - No new variables are introduced or modified by the call to `func_20`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
