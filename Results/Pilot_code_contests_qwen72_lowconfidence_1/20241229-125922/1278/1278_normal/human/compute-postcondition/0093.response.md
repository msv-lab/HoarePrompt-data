Initial State: `a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`.

1. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `b2 = a * (b - n)` calculates the new value of `b2`.
   - We need to substitute the known values and expressions into this equation.

2. **Substitution**:
   - `a` and `b` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `n` is also updated to the value returned by `func_3()`.
   - Therefore, `b2 = a * (b - n)`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The values of `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`, and `a2` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()` and the previous calculation.
   - The new value of `b2` is `a * (b - n)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`**.
