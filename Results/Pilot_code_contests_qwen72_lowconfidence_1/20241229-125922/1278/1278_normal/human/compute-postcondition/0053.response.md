To address the given task, let's analyze the impact of the code snippet on the program:

### Initial State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_20(x * b)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables Affected:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `x * b`.
   - This means that the product of `x` and `b` is passed to `func_20`.

2. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The variables `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line of code.
   - The value of `b1` remains `b - y`.

3. **Function Call:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `x * b`.
   - The return value of `func_20` is not captured or used in this snippet, so we do not know what happens to the result of the function call.

### Output State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer
- `func_20(x * b)` is called, but no changes to the variables are made by this line of code.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(x * b)` is called.**
