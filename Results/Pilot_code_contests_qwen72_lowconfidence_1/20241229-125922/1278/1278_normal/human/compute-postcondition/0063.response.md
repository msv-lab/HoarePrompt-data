The code snippet updates the value of `a2`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `a1` is defined as `a - x`.
- `b1` is defined as `b - y`.
- The value of `a2` is calculated as `x * (b - (n - a1))`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `a - x`.
- `b1` is `b - y`.
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

Let's compute the new value of `a2`:

1. `a1` is `a - x`.
2. `n - a1` is `n - (a - x)`.
3. `b - (n - a1)` simplifies to `b - (n - (a - x))`, which further simplifies to `b - n + a - x`.
4. `a2` is then `x * (b - n + a - x)`.

Since `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, their values might change, but the exact values are not specified. However, the formula for `a2` is clear.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a1` is `a - x`.
- `b1` is `b - y`.
- `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`.
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer**.
