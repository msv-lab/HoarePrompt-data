To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the for loop can start iterating over the elements in `args`.

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over each element in the `args` tuple.
- For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.

### Initial State:
- `args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' '.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes, `args` must contain at least one element. If `args` is an empty tuple, the loop will not execute.
- The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, `at_start`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but their values should be consistent with the initial state.

### Final State:
- `args` must contain at least one element.
- All other variables remain as they are.

State: **`args` must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (excluding 'sep' and 'file' if they were present), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False, `at_start` is `True`**
