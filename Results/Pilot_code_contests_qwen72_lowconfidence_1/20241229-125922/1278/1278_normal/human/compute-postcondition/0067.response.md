The value of `b2` is assigned the product of `b` and `(a - n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer, these conditions remain valid. The specific values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are not provided, so they are kept as is.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, `func_1()` returns a positive integer**
