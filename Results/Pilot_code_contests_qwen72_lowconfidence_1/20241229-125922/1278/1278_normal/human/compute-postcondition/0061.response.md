The function `func_20` is called with the argument `min(a2, b2)`. This means the minimum value between `a2` and `b2` is passed to `func_20`. Since the definition of `func_20` is not provided, we cannot determine what happens inside the function or what it returns. However, the act of calling the function does not change the values of the variables unless the function itself modifies them (which we assume it does not since no such information is given).

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the function `func_20` has been called with the argument `min(a2, b2)`.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`, `func_20(min(a2, b2))` has been called.**
