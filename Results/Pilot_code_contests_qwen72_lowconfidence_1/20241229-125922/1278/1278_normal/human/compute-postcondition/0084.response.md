Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `a1 > b1`, `func_20(x * b)` is called, but no changes to the variables are made by this call. Otherwise, `func_20(y * a)` is called, but no changes to the variables are made by this call.***
