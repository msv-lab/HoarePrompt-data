Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer. If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`. Otherwise, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` has been called.***
