The code snippet `b2 = b * (a - n)` impacts the value of `b2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

- `b2` is now assigned the value `b * (a - n)`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, `max(a1, b1) <= n`, `a1 >= b1`, `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`**
