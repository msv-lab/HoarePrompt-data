To analyze the impact of the code snippet `func_20((b - n) * a)` on the program, let's break down the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a1` is `a - x`
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
   - `b1` is `b - y`
   - `func_1()` must return a positive integer

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `(b - n) * a` is evaluated first.
   - The result of this expression is passed as an argument to `func_20`.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are assumed to have been updated by `func_3()`. However, the specific values of these variables after `func_3()` is called are not provided in the initial state.
   - The value of `(b - n) * a` is calculated using the updated values of `b`, `n`, and `a`.
   - The function `func_20` is called with the result of `(b - n) * a` as its argument.

4. **Output State**:
   - The variables `a1`, `b1`, and the requirement that `func_1()` must return a positive integer remain unchanged.
   - The call to `func_20` does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, or `n` directly, but it may perform some operations or return a value depending on its implementation.
   - Since the specific behavior of `func_20` is not provided, we assume it does not return a value that affects the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, and `func_20((b - n) * a)` has been called.**
