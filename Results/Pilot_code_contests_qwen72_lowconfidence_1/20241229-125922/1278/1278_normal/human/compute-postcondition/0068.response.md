The function `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the argument being the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`. The values of `a2` and `b2` are calculated as follows:

- `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`
- `b2` is `b * (a - n)`

The function `func_20` is executed with the maximum of these two values. Since the exact implementation of `func_20` is not provided, we cannot determine its side effects or what it returns. However, assuming `func_20` does not modify any global variables or return a value, the only impact of this line of code is the execution of `func_20`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, `func_1()` returns a positive integer, `func_20(max(a2, b2))` has been called.**
