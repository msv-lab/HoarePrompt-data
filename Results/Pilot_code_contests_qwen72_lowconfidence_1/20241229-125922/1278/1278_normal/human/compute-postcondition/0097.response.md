The code snippet provided is:

```
b2 = b * (a - n)
func_20(max(a2, b2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`.
   - `b2` is `b * (a - n)`.
   - All other variables (`a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`) remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `b2 = b * (a - n)` assigns the value of `b * (a - n)` to `b2`. This does not change any other variables.
   - The line `func_20(max(a2, b2))` calls the function `func_20` with the argument `max(a2, b2)`. This means the function `func_20` is called with the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `b2` is `b * (a - n)`.
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `max(a2, b2)`, but this does not change the values of `a2`, `b2`, or any other variables. It only indicates that the function `func_20` is executed with the specified argument.

### Output State:
**`a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, all other variables (`a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`) remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` has been called.**
