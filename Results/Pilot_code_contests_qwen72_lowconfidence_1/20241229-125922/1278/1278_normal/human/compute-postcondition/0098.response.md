Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`. If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`. Otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`. In both cases, `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.***
