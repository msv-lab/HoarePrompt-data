The provided Python code snippet calls `func_20(int(x * y))`. To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of this line of code:

1. **Input Calculation**: The product of `x` and `y` is calculated (`x * y`), and the result is converted to an integer using `int()`.
2. **Function Call**: The integer result from the product calculation is passed as an argument to `func_20`.

Since the initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer, these conditions remain unchanged by the execution of `func_20(int(x * y))`. However, the specific effects of `func_20` are not detailed in the initial state, so we cannot specify changes to any variables within `func_20` itself.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer
- `func_20(int(x * y))` is called with the integer value of `x * y` as its argument.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer, `func_20(int(x * y))` is called.**
