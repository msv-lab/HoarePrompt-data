To address the task, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program state:

Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

Code Snippet:
```python
func_20(int(x * y))
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the variables involved in the calculation:**
   - `x` and `y` are variables whose values are determined by the return values from `func_3()`.
   - The expression `x * y` is evaluated and converted to an integer using `int()`.

2. **Impact of the function call:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `int(x * y)`.
   - The exact behavior of `func_20` is not specified, so we assume it does not modify any global variables or return any value that affects the current state.

3. **Determine the updated state:**
   - Since `func_20` does not return any value or modify any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were after being updated by `func_3()`.

Output State:
**`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
