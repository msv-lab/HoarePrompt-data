To address the task, let's consider the given code snippet and its impact on the program:

### Initial State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_20(x * b)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Affected Variables:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `x * b`.
   - This implies that the values of `x` and `b` are used in the calculation `x * b`.

2. **Check Previous Values:**
   - `x` and `b` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - The exact values of `x` and `b` after `func_3()` are not specified, so we will refer to them as `x` and `b` respectively.

3. **Calculate the Argument:**
   - The argument passed to `func_20` is `x * b`.

4. **Function Call Impact:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `x * b`.
   - Without knowing the implementation of `func_20`, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables or if it returns any value.

5. **Update Output State:**
   - Since the function `func_20` does not return any value (or if it does, it is not assigned to any variable), the values of `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `b1` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `func_20(x * b)` is called, but no changes to the variables are made by this call.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `func_20(x * b)` is called.**
