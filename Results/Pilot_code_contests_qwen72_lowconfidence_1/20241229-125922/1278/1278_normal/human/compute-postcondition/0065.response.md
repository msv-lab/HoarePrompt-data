The function `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called, which means `max(a2, b2)` is evaluated first, and then passed as an argument to `func_20`. The exact behavior of `func_20` and its return value are not specified, so we can only describe the changes in terms of the arguments and the call itself.

- `a2` is defined as `x * (b - n + a - x)`
- `b2` is defined as `a * (b - n)`
- `max(a2, b2)` will return the larger of the two values `a2` and `b2`.
- `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`.

Since the initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, these variables may have new values before `func_20` is called, but the specific updates are not detailed. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` after `func_3()`.

However, the function `func_1()` must return a positive integer, which suggests that the overall context involves operations that ensure positive outcomes.

Given this, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the maximum value between `a2` and `b2`, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer.**
