The function `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called with the argument being the maximum of `a2` and `b2`. Since the function `func_20` is not defined in the provided context, its exact behavior cannot be determined. However, assuming `func_20` returns a value, this value will be the result of the function call.

Given the initial state:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`
- `a1 = a - x`
- `b1 = b - y`
- `min(a1, b1) < n`
- `max(a1, b1) <= n`
- `a1 >= b1`
- `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`
- `b2 = b * (a - n)`

The code `func_20(max(a2, b2))` will execute, and the function `func_20` will return a value, which we will denote as `result`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, `max(a1, b1) <= n`, `a1 >= b1`, `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`, `result` is returned by `func_20(max(a2, b2))`**
