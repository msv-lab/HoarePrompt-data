The code snippet `a1 = a - x` affects the variable `a1` by setting its value to the result of subtracting `x` from `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` returns a positive integer, we need to consider the following:

- `a1` is now equal to `a - x`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were returned by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` returning a positive integer does not affect the current code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `func_1()` returns a positive integer**.
