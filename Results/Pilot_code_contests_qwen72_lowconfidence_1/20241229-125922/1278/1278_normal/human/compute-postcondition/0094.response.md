**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial State Review**:
   - `a1` is `a - x`
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
   - `b1` is `b - y`
   - `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`
   - `b2` is `a * (b - n)`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is executed.
   - This function call will compare `a2` and `b2`, and pass the maximum of these two values to `func_20`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - No new variables are introduced or modified by this line of code.
   - The values of `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain unchanged.
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `max(a2, b2)`, which means the function receives the larger of the two values between `a2` and `b2`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All the initial state conditions remain valid.
   - The only action taken is the invocation of `func_20` with the argument `max(a2, b2)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.**
