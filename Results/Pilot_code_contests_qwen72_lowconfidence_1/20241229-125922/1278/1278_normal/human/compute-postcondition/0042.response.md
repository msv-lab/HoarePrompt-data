Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, and `min(a1, b1) < n`. If `max(a1, b1) == n`, then: 
- If `a1 > b1`, the current value of `a1` is greater than the current value of `b1`.
- Otherwise, `a1` is not greater than `b1`, and `func_20(y * a)` has been called.
If `max(a1, b1) != n`, then:
- If `max(a1, b1) > n` and `a1 < b1`, then `a2 = x * (a + b - n - x)`, `b2 = a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
- If `max(a1, b1) > n` and `a1 >= b1`, then `a2 = y * (a + b - n - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
- If `max(a1, b1) <= n` and `a1 < b1`, then `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2 = a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.
- If `max(a1, b1) <= n` and `a1 >= b1`, then `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.***
