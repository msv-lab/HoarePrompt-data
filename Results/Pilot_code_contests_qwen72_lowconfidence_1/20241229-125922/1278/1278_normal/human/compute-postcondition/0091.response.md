Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called. Otherwise, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`.***
