To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the variables in the initial state. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a1` is `a - x`
   - `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
   - `b1` is `b - y`

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   func_20((b - n) * a)
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the argument `(b - n) * a`.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are already updated to the values returned by `func_3()` before this line of code is executed.
   - The function `func_20` does not modify any of the variables directly in the given context, but it might return a value or have side effects that affect the program state.

4. **Output State:**
   - Since `func_20` does not modify the variables directly, the values of `a1`, `b1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
   - However, if `func_20` returns a value, it should be noted in the output state.

Given the lack of information about what `func_20` returns, we assume it does not return a value that affects the state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`**
