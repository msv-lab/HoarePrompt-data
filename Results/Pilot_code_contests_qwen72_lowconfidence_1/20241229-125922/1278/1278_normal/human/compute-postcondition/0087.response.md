To address the task, let's break down the provided code and its impact on the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`
- `b2` is `a * (b - n)`

### Code:
```python
func_20(min(a2, b2))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the variables involved in the function call:**
   - `a2` and `b2` are used in the `min` function.

2. **Calculate the values of `a2` and `b2`:**
   - `a2` is calculated as `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`
   - `b2` is calculated as `a * (b - n)`

3. **Determine the minimum of `a2` and `b2`:**
   - `min(a2, b2)` will return the smaller of the two values.

4. **Call `func_20` with the minimum value:**
   - The function `func_20` is called with the minimum value of `a2` and `b2`.

### Impact on the Program:
- The values of `a2` and `b2` are used in the `min` function, but their actual values are not changed by this operation.
- The function `func_20` is called with the minimum of `a2` and `b2`, but since we don't know what `func_20` does, we assume it does not modify any variables or return any values that affect the state.

### Updated State:
- The values of `a1`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
- The only change is that `func_20` is called with the minimum of `a2` and `b2`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.**
