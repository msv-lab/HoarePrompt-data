The code snippet provided updates the value of `b2` based on the current values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `b2` is assigned the value of `b * (a - n)`.
- The variables `a1`, `b1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` remains `a - x`
- `b1` remains `b - y`
- `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n`) are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`

After executing the code snippet:
- `b2` is now `b * (a - n)`, where `a`, `b`, and `n` are the new values returned by `func_3()`.
- The values of `a1`, `b1`, and `a2` remain as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` remains `a - x`, `b1` remains `b - y`, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)`, `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**.
