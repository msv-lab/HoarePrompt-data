To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which the loop can continue based on the provided state and the `for` loop statement.

### Given State:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`.
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
- The loop condition is `for _ in range(func_1())`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_1()` returns a positive integer. This means that the state must ensure that `func_1()` continues to return a positive integer for the loop to continue.

2. **State Update**: The state variables `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`. This implies that the values of these variables will change after each iteration, and these changes will affect the return value of `func_1()`.

3. **Conditions in the Loop Body**:
   - If `a - x + (b - y) <= n`, then `func_20(int(x * y))` is called.
   - Otherwise, `a1` is `a - x` and `b1` is `b - y`.
     - If `min(a1, b1) >= n`, then `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
       - If `a < b`, `func_20((a - n) * b)` is called.
       - Otherwise, `func_20((b - n) * a)` is called.
     - If `min(a1, b1) < n` and `max(a1, b1) == n`:
       - If `a1 > b1`, `func_20(x * b)` is called.
       - Otherwise, `func_20(y * a)` is called.
     - If `max(a1, b1) > n`:
       - If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
       - Otherwise, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`, `b2` is `b_new * (a_new - n_new)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
     - If `max(a1, b1) <= n`:
       - If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.
       - Otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer.
- The state variables `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` must be updated by `func_3()` in such a way that the conditions inside the loop body allow `func_1()` to return a positive integer.

Given the complexity of the conditions, the adjusted state should reflect the updated values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` after `func_3()` is called, ensuring that the loop can continue to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
