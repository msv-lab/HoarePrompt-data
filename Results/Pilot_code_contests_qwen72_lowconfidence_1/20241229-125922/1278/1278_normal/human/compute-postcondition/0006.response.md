Postcondition: ***`args` must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (excluding 'sep' and 'file' if they were present), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False. If `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to `file`. Otherwise, `at_start` remains `True`.***
