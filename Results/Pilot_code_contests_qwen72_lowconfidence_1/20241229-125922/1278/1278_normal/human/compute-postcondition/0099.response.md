Postcondition: ***`a1` is `a - x`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. If `max(a1, b1) > n`: 
- If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - (n - (a - x)))` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(min(a2, b2))` is called.
- Otherwise, `a2` is `y * (a + b - n - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`.

If `max(a1, b1) <= n`:
- If `a1 < b1`, `a2` is `x * (b - n + a - x)` and `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.
- Otherwise, `a2` is `x * (a - n + b - y)` and `b2` is `b * (a - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` is called.***
