The code snippet provided updates the variable `b2` based on the current values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. Since `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, we do not have their exact values here, but we know they are updated before this code runs. The variable `b2` is calculated as `a * (b - n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

The new value of `b2` is calculated as `a * (b - n)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `b2` is `a * (b - n)`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, `b2` is `a * (b - n)`, `func_1()` must return a positive integer**
