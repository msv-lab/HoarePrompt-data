Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, and `max(a1, b1) <= n`. If `a1 < b1`, `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2 = a * (b - n)`, and `func_20(max(a2, b2))` has been called. Otherwise, if `a1 >= b1`, `a2 = x * (a - n + b - y)`, `b2 = b * (a - n)`, and `result` is returned by `func_20(max(a2, b2))`.***
