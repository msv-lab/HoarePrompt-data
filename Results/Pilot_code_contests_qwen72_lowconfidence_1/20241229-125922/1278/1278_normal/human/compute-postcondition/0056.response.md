To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables:

- **Initial State**: `a1` is `a - x`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  a2 = x * (b - (n - a1))
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Values**:
   - `a1` is defined as `a - x`.
   - `a2` is calculated using the formula `x * (b - (n - a1))`.

2. **Substitute `a1` in the Formula**:
   - `a1` is `a - x`.
   - Substitute `a1` in the formula for `a2`:
     ```python
     a2 = x * (b - (n - (a - x)))
     ```

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     ```python
     a2 = x * (b - (n - a + x))
     a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)
     a2 = x * (a + b - n - x)
     ```

4. **Update the State**:
   - The value of `a2` is now `x * (a + b - n - x)`.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were updated by `func_3()`.
   - `b1` remains `b - y`.
   - `func_1()` must return a positive integer, which is not affected by this code snippet.

### Output State:
**`a1` is `a - x`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a2` is `x * (a + b - n - x)`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`, `b1` is `b - y`, and `func_1()` must return a positive integer.**
