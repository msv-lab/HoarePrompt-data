To solve this, let's break down the code snippet and its impact on the variables:

- `a2 = y * (a - (n - b1))`

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is `a - x`
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated by `func_3()`
- `b1` is `b - y`
- `func_1()` must return a positive integer

Let's assume the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` after `func_3()` are known (since the exact values depend on the implementation of `func_3()`). For the sake of this example, let's denote the updated values of these variables as `a_new`, `b_new`, `x_new`, `y_new`, and `n_new`.

1. **Calculate `b1`:**
   - `b1` is defined as `b - y`. After `func_3()`, this becomes `b1 = b_new - y_new`.

2. **Calculate `a2`:**
   - `a2` is defined as `y * (a - (n - b1))`.
   - Substitute the updated values: `a2 = y_new * (a_new - (n_new - (b_new - y_new)))`.
   - Simplify the expression: `a2 = y_new * (a_new - (n_new - b_new + y_new))`.
   - Further simplification: `a2 = y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `a1` is `a - x` (unchanged)
- `a` is `a_new` (updated by `func_3()`)
- `b` is `b_new` (updated by `func_3()`)
- `x` is `x_new` (updated by `func_3()`)
- `y` is `y_new` (updated by `func_3()`)
- `n` is `n_new` (updated by `func_3()`)
- `b1` is `b_new - y_new`
- `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`

Output State: **`a1` is `a - x`, `a` is `a_new`, `b` is `b_new`, `x` is `x_new`, `y` is `y_new`, `n` is `n_new`, `b1` is `b_new - y_new`, `a2` is `y_new * (a_new - n_new + b_new - y_new)`**
