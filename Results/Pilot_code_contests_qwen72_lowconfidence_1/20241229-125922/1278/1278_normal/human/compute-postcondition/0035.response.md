Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`
- `a1 = a - x`
- `b1 = b - y`
- `min(a1, b1) < n`
- `max(a1, b1) <= n`
- `a1 < b1`
- `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`
- `b2 = a * (b - n)`

Code Snippet:
```python
func_20(max(a2, b2))
```

Now, let's update the state accordingly:

- The function `func_20` is called with the argument `max(a2, b2)`.
- `a2` is calculated as `x * (b - n + a - x)`.
- `b2` is calculated as `a * (b - n)`.
- The maximum of `a2` and `b2` is passed to `func_20`.

Since `func_20` is a function call, we need to assume it has some effect. However, without knowing the implementation of `func_20`, we can only state that it has been called with the argument `max(a2, b2)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, `max(a1, b1) <= n`, `a1 < b1`, `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2 = a * (b - n)`, `func_20(max(a2, b2)) has been called`**

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated with the values returned by `func_3()`, `(a - x + (b - y)) > n`, `a1 = a - x`, `b1 = b - y`, `min(a1, b1) < n`, `max(a1, b1) <= n`, `a1 < b1`, `a2 = x * (b - n + a - x)`, `b2 = a * (b - n)`, `func_20(max(a2, b2)) has been called`**
