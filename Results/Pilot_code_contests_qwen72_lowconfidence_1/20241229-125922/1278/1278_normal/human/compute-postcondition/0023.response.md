Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of arguments of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters such as 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' (excluding 'sep' and 'file' if they were present) with `'end'` removed if it was present and `'flush'` removed if it was present, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed, otherwise ' ', `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a string appended after the last value, defaulting to a newline character, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, defaulting to False, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `True`, each element in `args` has been written to `file` as a string, separated by `sep` if `args` contains more than one element, and the value of `end` (or `'\n'` if `end` was not in `kwargs`) has been written to `file`. If `flush` is `True`, the file buffer has been flushed.***
