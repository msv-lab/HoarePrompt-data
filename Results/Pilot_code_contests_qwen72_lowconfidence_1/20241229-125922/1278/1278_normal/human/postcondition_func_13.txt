The function `func_14` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (where `y > 0`). It returns the integer division result of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y â‰  0`), it returns the integer division result plus 1. Edge cases to consider include when `x` is negative, in which case the function still follows the same logic, returning the integer division result or the result plus 1 based on divisibility.
