#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and it is expected to read an integer from the standard input which represents the number of test cases t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer representing the number of test cases t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from the standard input, which is intended to represent the number of test cases `t`. The function then returns this integer. According to the return postconditions, the integer should be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. However, the function does not enforce this constraint, so the returned value could be outside this range if the input is invalid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are present. The function `func_2` does not take any parameters and simply returns the input from the user. This function is likely used to read input for the test cases but does not directly interact with the variables a, b, x, y, or n.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. It reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. Edge cases include scenarios where the user provides no input (an empty string is returned), or where the input contains special characters or multiple lines (the entire input up to the first newline character is returned).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any arguments and is used to read input from stdin. It assumes that the input is a line of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element of the input line (a sequence of space-separated integers) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the input to be a sequence of space-separated integers. It then returns an iterator that yields each of these integers as an `int`. If the input contains non-integer values or is not properly formatted (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty, the function will return an empty iterator.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. The function reads input from stdin and returns a list of strings.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split())
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained from splitting the stripped input from stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the resulting string by whitespace, and returns a list of the resulting substrings. If the input is empty or consists only of whitespace, the function will return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the original problem (a, b, x, y, n, t) are present in the function `func_5`. This function does not take any parameters and does not directly contribute to solving the problem described.

    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The contents of this list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`, which is not provided here.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns a list that is the result of calling `func_3()`. The contents of this list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`, which is not provided. If `func_3()` raises an exception, `func_5` will also raise that exception. If `func_3()` returns an iterable other than a list, `func_5` will convert it to a list before returning.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and thus there are no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets the recursion limit to 1,000,000 and the stack size to 1,024,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread that starts the `main` function and begins executing it. The function itself does not return any value. After `func_6` concludes, the new thread continues to run independently, potentially affecting the program state depending on what `main` does. The main thread that called `func_6` will continue its execution immediately after starting the new thread.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple with at least two elements.
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the list or tuple 'item'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple with at least two elements, and returns the second element of `item`. If `item` does not have at least two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements where each element is a dictionary or an object that has a key or attribute accessible by the getKey function, which is not provided in the snippet.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, where the sorting is done in descending order based on the value returned by `getKey` for each element. Each element in this returned list is a dictionary or an object from the original list `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` takes a list `l` as input, where each element in the list is either a dictionary or an object that has a key or attribute accessible via the `getKey` function. It returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l` in descending order based on the values returned by `getKey` for each element. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If `l` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any element in `l` does not have a valid key or attribute for `getKey`, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, and num is an integer.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` elements, all being the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, all of which are the integer `num`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. If `m` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` empty lists. The function does not modify the input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns 0 if `x` is 0, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts an integer `x` and returns `0` if `x` is `0`, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` otherwise. Note that the function correctly identifies powers of 2 and non-powers of 2, including negative integers, which will always return `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of n as a string without the '0b' prefix, where n is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. For any other non-negative integer, it returns the corresponding binary string. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and such inputs would result in a `TypeError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the integer 'n'. The order of the digits in the list corresponds to their order in 'n'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n` in the same order as they appear in `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `[0]`. If `n` is negative, the function converts `n` to its absolute value before processing, ensuring the returned list contains only positive digits.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers where n ≥ r.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
    #The program returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!) where n and r are non-negative integers and n ≥ r. The result is the number of ways to choose r elements from a set of n elements without repetition and without order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with `n` ≥ `r`. It returns the integer value of the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from a set of `n` elements without repetition and without order. However, there is a potential edge case where if `n - r` is 0, the function uses `max(n - r, 1)` in the denominator, which could lead to incorrect results when `n = r` (since it should be 1, not 0!). The correct behavior should be to use `factorial(n - r)` directly to ensure accuracy. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the return value, which is the computed combination.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that y > 0.
def func_14(x, y):
    if (x % y == 0) :
        return x // y
        #The program returns the integer division result of x by y, which is the quotient of x divided by y without the remainder, given that x is divisible by y (i.e., x % y == 0) and y > 0.
    else :
        return x // y + 1
        #The program returns the integer division of x by y (which is not a perfect division since x % y ≠ 0) plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts two integers `x` and `y` (where `y > 0`). It returns the integer division result of `x` by `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is not divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y ≠ 0`), it returns the integer division result plus 1. Edge cases to consider include when `x` is negative, in which case the function still follows the same logic, returning the integer division result or the result plus 1 based on divisibility.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x, y, and p are integers where x and p are non-negative, and y is non-negative. Additionally, p must be greater than 0.
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `x` is `x^(2^iterations) % p`, `y` is `y // (2^iterations)`, `p` is an integer greater than 0, `res` is `x^(y_binary_sum) % p`, where `y_binary_sum` is the sum of the binary digits of the original value of `y`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is `x^(y_binary_sum) % p`, where `x` is `x^(2^iterations) % p`, `y` is `y // (2^iterations)`, `p` is an integer greater than 0, and `y_binary_sum` is the sum of the binary digits of the original value of `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `p` are non-negative integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is greater than 0. The function computes and returns `res`, which is `x^y % p`. The function effectively calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is modified to `x % p`, `y` is reduced to 0, and `p` remains unchanged. The final value of `res` is the result of the modular exponentiation. The function handles edge cases where `y` is 0, returning 1, and ensures that the result is always within the range `[0, p-1]`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the variable `y` is guaranteed to be 0, and `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function handles the edge case where either `x` or `y` is 0, returning the non-zero value as the GCD. If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_17(n):
    if (n <= 1) :

    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 3, not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number up to the largest prime `p` such that \( p^2 \leq n \); `i` is the smallest integer greater than the last checked prime such that \( i \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \) or \( i \equiv 11 \pmod{6} \). If `n` is divisible by any checked prime, the program returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number greater than 3 and not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number up to the largest prime `p` such that \( p^2 \leq n \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` accepts an integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Specifically, the function handles the following cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is greater than 3 and divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For `n` greater than 3 and not divisible by 2 or 3, the function checks divisibility by all integers of the form `6k ± 1` (where `k` is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.
- If no divisors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than or equal to 1.
- The function correctly identifies 2 and 3 as prime numbers.
- The function efficiently checks for primality by only considering potential divisors of the form `6k ± 1`, which covers all possible prime divisors.
- The function does not explicitly handle negative integers, but since the initial check ensures `n` is greater than 1, negative values are implicitly handled by returning `False`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables a, b, x, y, n, or t are used in the function `func_18`.

def func_18():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` does not accept any parameters. It redirects the standard input to read from the file `input.txt` and the standard output to write to the file `output.txt`. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from `input.txt`, and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to `output.txt`. If `input.txt` does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will raise an `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError`. Similarly, if `output.txt` cannot be opened for writing, the function will also raise an `IOError`.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()` for each iteration of the loop. The loop executes a number of times determined by `func_1()`, which must return a positive integer for the loop to execute. After the loop completes, the final values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are the last set of values returned by `func_3()`. If the condition `a - x + (b - y) <= n` holds true at any iteration, `func_20(int(x * y))` is called. If `a - x + (b - y) > n`, various conditions involving `a1 = a - x` and `b1 = b - y` determine which arguments are passed to `func_20`. The exact values passed to `func_20` depend on the specific values of `a1`, `b1`, and `n` during each iteration. If the loop does not execute, the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` processes a series of operations based on the input parameters `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n`, all of which are integers within the range 1 ≤ a, b, x, y, n ≤ 10^9, with the additional constraints a ≥ x and b ≥ y. The function iterates a number of times determined by the return value of `func_1()`, which must be a positive integer. During each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. Depending on the relationship between these values, the function calls `func_20` with different arguments. Specifically, if `a - x + (b - y) <= n`, `func_20` is called with the argument `int(x * y)`. If `a - x + (b - y) > n`, the function computes intermediate values `a1 = a - x` and `b1 = b - y`, and then calls `func_20` with one of several possible arguments based on the values of `a1`, `b1`, and `n`. The exact argument passed to `func_20` depends on the specific conditions met during each iteration. After the loop completes, the final values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are the last set of values returned by `func_3()`. If `func_1()` returns 0, the function does not execute the loop, and the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
