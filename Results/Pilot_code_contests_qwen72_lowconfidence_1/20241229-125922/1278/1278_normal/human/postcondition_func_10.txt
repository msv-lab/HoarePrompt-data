The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. For any other non-negative integer, it returns the corresponding binary string. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and such inputs would result in a `TypeError`.
