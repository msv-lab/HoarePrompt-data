The function `func_12` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n` in the same order as they appear in `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `[0]`. If `n` is negative, the function converts `n` to its absolute value before processing, ensuring the returned list contains only positive digits.
