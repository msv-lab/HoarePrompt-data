The code snippet `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` assigns the list containing the first element of `l` (`l[0]`) to the key `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr`.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `l` is still a list of strings from the input.
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`.
- Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`.
- Now, `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`. `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.**
