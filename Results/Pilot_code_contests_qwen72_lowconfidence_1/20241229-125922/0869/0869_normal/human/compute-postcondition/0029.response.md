The code `cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the list `cand`. 

- `cand` initially contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`.
- After executing `cand.remove(l[1])`, `l[1]` is removed from `cand`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` (appended to its existing values if any)
- `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`, and `l[1]` has been removed from `cand`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` (appended to its existing values if any), `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`, and `l[1]` has been removed from `cand`.**
