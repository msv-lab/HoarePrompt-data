The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `l`. This operation affects the value of `l` but does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `nbr`, or `cand`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- `nbr` is a dictionary (initially unspecified)
- `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)

After executing the code:
- `l` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary (initially unspecified), `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)**
