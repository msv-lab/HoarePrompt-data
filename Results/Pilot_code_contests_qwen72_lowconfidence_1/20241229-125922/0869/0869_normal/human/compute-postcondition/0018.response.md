Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` is a set containing `{l[0], l[1]}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or a set containing `{l[1]}` if `cand` was initially empty. If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is an empty set if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]` and `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]`, and `cand` is an empty set if `l[0]` was in `nbr` initially.***
