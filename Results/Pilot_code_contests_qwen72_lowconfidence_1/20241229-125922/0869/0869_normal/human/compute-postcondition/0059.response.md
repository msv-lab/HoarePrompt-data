The code snippet adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is added to `marked`.
- All other variables (`n`, `nbr`, `cand`, `res`, `Q`, `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the values of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is an empty list, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` contains at least one element.**
