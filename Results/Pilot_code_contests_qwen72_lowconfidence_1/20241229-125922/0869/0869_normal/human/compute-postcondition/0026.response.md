The code snippet `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by setting the key `l[1]` to a list containing the value `l[0]`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or `cand`.

Here is the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary.
   - If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` and `cand` contains the string `l[0]`.
   - If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `l[1]` appended to its existing values, and `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `nbr[l[1]] = [l[0]]` sets the key `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr` to a list containing the value `l[0]`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `l` remains a list of strings from the input.
   - `nbr` now has the key `l[1]` set to a list containing the value `l[0]`.
   - The condition regarding `cand` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not in `nbr` and does not contain the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` is in `nbr`.**
