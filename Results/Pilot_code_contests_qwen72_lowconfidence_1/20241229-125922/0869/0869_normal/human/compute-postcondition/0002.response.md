The code snippet initializes a new set called `cand`. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state, such as `n`, the pairs of integers representing stamps, or the empty dictionary `nbr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the subsequent `n` lines contain pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps, where each integer is between 1 and 109, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set**
