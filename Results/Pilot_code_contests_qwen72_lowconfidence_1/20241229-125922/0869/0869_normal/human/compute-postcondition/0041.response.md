The code `cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the list `cand`. This impacts the contents of `cand`, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of strings from the input.
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`.
- `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`.

After executing `cand.remove(l[1])`, `l[1]` is removed from `cand`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`. `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`. `cand` does not include `l[1]`.**
