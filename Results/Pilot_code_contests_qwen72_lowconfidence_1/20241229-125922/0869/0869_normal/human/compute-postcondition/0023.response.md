The code snippet `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` modifies the dictionary `nbr` by appending the second element of the list `l` to the list associated with the key that is the first element of `l`. This operation assumes that `l` contains at least two elements and that `nbr` is initialized such that `nbr[l[0]]` already exists and is a list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- `nbr` is a dictionary (initially unspecified)
- `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `nbr[l[0]]` is updated by appending `l[1]` to the list that `nbr[l[0]]` points to.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, and `cand`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `nbr[l[0]]` is a list with `l[1]` appended to its existing values, `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)**.
