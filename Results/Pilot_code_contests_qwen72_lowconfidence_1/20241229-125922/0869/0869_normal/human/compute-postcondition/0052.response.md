The code snippet `marked.add(v)` adds the value of `v` to the set `marked`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `v`, we assume it is a variable that holds a specific value at the time this line of code is executed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`.**
