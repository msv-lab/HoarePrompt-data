The code `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`. Based on the initial state, `res` is either `[v]` if `i` is in `marked` or `[v, i]` if `i` is not in `marked`.

- If `i` is in `marked`, `res` was initially `[v]`, and after appending `i`, `res` becomes `[v, i]`.
- If `i` is not in `marked`, `res` was initially `[v, i]`, and after appending `i`, `res` becomes `[v, i, i]`.

However, since `i` is the same element being appended, the second case is redundant and should be simplified to just appending `i` once to the list.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`
- `res` is `[v, i]` regardless of whether `i` was in `marked` or not
- `Q` is an empty list if `i` is in `marked` or `[i]` if `i` is not in `marked`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i]`, `Q` is an empty list if `i` is in `marked` or `[i]` if `i` is not in `marked`**
