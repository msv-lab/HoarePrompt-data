To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the current state and the conditions for the loop to continue:

### Current State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is 1.
- `l` is a list of strings from the input.
- If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains both `l[0]` (if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`) and `l[1]`.
- If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` appended to its existing values, `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`, and `l[1]` has been removed from `cand`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `2`.
2. **Check `n`**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` remains a list of strings from the input.
- The contents of `nbr` and `cand` remain as described based on the operations performed in the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains both `l[0]` (if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`) and `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` appended to its existing values, `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`, and `l[1]` has been removed from `cand`.**
