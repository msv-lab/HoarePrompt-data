The code `cand.remove(l[0])` removes the first element of the list `l` from the set or list `cand`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is still a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is still 2.
- `l` is still a list of strings from the input.
- `nbr[l[0]]` still includes `l[1]`.
- `cand` no longer contains `l[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]`, `cand` does not include `l[0]`.**
