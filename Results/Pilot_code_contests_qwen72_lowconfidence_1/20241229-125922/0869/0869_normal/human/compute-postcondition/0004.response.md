The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `l`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `nbr`, and `cand`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings from the input**
