The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This means that `i` is now included in `marked`, which could affect future checks involving `marked`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`; otherwise, `Q` is an empty list.**
