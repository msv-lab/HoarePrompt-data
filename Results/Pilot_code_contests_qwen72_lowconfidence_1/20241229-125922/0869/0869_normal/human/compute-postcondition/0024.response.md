The code snippet `cand.remove(l[0])` removes the first element of the list `l` from the set `cand`. This operation assumes that `l[0]` is an element of the set `cand`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `nbr[l[0]]` is a list with `l[1]` appended to its existing values
- `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `cand` is updated by removing the element `l[0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, and `nbr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `nbr[l[0]]` is a list with `l[1]` appended to its existing values, `cand` is a set without the element `l[0]`**.
