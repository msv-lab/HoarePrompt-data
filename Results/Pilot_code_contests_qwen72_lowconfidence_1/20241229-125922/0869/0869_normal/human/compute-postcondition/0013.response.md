The code snippet updates the dictionary `nbr` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `l[1]` and the value is a list containing `[l[0]]`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `cand`). However, since `l[1]` was not in `nbr` initially, this operation adds a new entry to `nbr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, `cand` is a set containing `{l[0]}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` remains an empty set.**
