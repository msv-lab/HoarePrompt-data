The code snippet `Q.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `Q`. Here’s the updated state:

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`.
- `nbr` remains a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` remains a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`.
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`.
- `Q` now contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, and `i` has been appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped and now includes `i`.**
