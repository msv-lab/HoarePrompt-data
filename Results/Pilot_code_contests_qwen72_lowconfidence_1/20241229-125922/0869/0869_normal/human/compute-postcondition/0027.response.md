**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.
   - `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not in `nbr` and does not contain the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` is in `nbr`.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `cand.add(l[1])` adds the string `l[1]` to the set `cand`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `l` remains a list of strings from the input.
   - `nbr` remains with the key `l[1]` set to a list containing the value `l[0]`.
   - `cand` now contains both the string `l[0]` (if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`) and the string `l[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`, `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` is not in `nbr` and also contains the string `l[1]`.**
