The code initializes an empty dictionary named `nbr`. This action does not affect the value of `n` or the pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), the subsequent `n` lines contain pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps, where each integer is between 1 and 109, `nbr` is an empty dictionary**
