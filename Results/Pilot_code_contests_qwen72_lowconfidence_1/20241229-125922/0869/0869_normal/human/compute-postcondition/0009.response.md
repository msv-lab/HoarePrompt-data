The code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` modifies the `nbr` dictionary. Since `nbr` is initially an empty dictionary and the first element of `l` is already a key in `nbr` (as per the initial state), the operation appends the second element of `l` to the list associated with the key `l[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings from the input, and the first element of `l` is in `nbr`.**
