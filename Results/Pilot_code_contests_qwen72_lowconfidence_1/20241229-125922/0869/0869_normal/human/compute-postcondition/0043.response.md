Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp. `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `nbr` remains an empty dictionary, and `cand` remains an empty set.**
