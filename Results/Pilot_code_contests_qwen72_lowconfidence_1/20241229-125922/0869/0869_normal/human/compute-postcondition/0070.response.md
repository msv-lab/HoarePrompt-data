The code snippet `res.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings.
- `cand` is a set containing stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`.
- `res` is initially `[v, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`; otherwise, `Q` is an empty list.

After executing `res.append(i)`, the value of `i` is added to the list `res`. The updated state is:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`.
- `res` is now `[v, i, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`; otherwise, `Q` is an empty list.

However, this seems to imply that `i` is added twice to `res` if it was not in `marked`. This is likely a mistake in the description, as typically `res` would be `[v, i]` before appending, and after appending, it would be `[v, i, i]` only if `i` is appended again. To be more precise, we should consider the correct initial state of `res`:

- If `res` was initially `[v, i]` (assuming `i` was not in `marked`), then after appending `i`, `res` will be `[v, i, i]`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`; otherwise, `Q` is an empty list.**
