Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`. If `i` is not in `marked`, `marked` is updated to contain both `v` and `i`, `res` is updated to `[v, i]`, and `Q` is updated to `[i]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged with `res` being `[v]` and `Q` being an empty list.***
