The line of code `nbr[l[0]].append(l[1])` modifies the dictionary `nbr`. Specifically, it appends the second element of the list `l` to the list that is the value associated with the key `l[0]` in the dictionary `nbr`.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `l` is a list of strings from the input, which is not modified by this code.
- `nbr` is updated such that the list corresponding to the key `l[0]` now includes the string `l[1]`.
- `cand` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]`, `cand` is unchanged.**
