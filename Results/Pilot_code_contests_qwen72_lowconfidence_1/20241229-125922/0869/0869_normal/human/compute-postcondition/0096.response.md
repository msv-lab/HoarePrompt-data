Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`, and `i` is not in `marked`.***
