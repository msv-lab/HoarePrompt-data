The code snippet `cand.add(l[1])` adds the element `l[1]` to the set `cand`. Since `cand` initially contains `{l[0]}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or is an empty set otherwise, adding `l[1]` to `cand` results in `cand` containing both `l[0]` and `l[1]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or just `l[1]` if `cand` was initially empty.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, `cand` is a set containing `{l[0], l[1]}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` is a set containing `{l[1]}`.**
