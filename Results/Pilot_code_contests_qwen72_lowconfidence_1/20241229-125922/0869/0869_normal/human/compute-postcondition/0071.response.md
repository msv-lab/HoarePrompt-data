The code `Q.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `Q`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`
- `res` is `[v, i, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`; otherwise, `Q` is an empty list

After executing `Q.append(i)`, the output state is:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`
- `res` is `[v, i, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`
- `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, and `i` is appended to `Q`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i, i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked`, `Q` is `[i]` if the new `i` is not in `marked` and `i` is appended to `Q`**
