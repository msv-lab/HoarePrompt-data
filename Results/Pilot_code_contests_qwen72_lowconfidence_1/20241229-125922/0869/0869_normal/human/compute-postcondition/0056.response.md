The value of `v` is updated by popping the last element from the list `Q`. Since `Q` was initially `[v]`, popping from `Q` removes the only element, which is `v`. Therefore, `Q` becomes an empty list, and `v` is now the value that was originally in `Q`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is an empty list, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q`.**
