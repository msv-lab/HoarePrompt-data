Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v`. If `i` is not in `marked`, `marked` also contains `i`, `res` is `[v, i]`, and `Q` is `[i]`. If `i` is in `marked`, `Q` remains an empty list.***
