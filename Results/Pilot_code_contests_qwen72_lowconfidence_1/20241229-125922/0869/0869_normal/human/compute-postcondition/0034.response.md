The code snippet `cand.add(l[0])` adds the first element of the list `l` to the set `cand`.

- The set `cand` is updated to include the value of `l[0]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `nbr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `cand` includes `l[0]`.**
