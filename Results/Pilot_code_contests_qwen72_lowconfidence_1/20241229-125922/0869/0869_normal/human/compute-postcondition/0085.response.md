The code snippet `Q.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Given the initial state, this means that `Q` now contains the new element `i` in addition to its previous contents. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now included in `marked`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` includes the new `i` in addition to its previous contents, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes the new `i`, `Q` now contains at least one less element plus the new `i` and has `i` appended to it, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.**
