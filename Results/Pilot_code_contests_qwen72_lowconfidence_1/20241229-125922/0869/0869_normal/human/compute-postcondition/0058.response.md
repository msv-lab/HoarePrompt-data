Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is an empty list, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` contains at least one element. Additionally, `i` is not in the set `marked`.***
