The value of `v` is updated to the last element removed from `Q`. Since `Q` must contain at least one element, removing an element from `Q` will change its content. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `nbr`, `cand`, `marked`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` now contains at least one less element, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped.**
