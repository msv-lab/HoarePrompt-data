The code `cand.add(l[0])` adds the first element of the list `l` to the set `cand`. This means that the set `cand` now contains the string `l[0]`.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` remains 1.
- `l` remains a list of strings from the input.
- `nbr` remains a dictionary with `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]`.
- `cand` now contains the string `l[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary with `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]`, `cand` is a set containing `l[0]`.**
