The code snippet `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` modifies the dictionary `nbr` by setting the key `l[0]` to a list containing the single element `l[1]`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary with `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]`, `cand` is a set (initially unspecified)**
