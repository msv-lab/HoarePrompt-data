To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a list of strings from the input.
- The conditions involving `nbr` and `cand` are complex but do not directly affect the loop control variable `i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variable (`i`)**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`.
   - At the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The new value of `i` will be 1.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to reflect the increment of `i` by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` is a set containing `{l[0], l[1]}` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or a set containing `{l[1]}` if `cand` was initially empty. If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is an empty set if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, or `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]` and `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]`, and `cand` is an empty set if `l[0]` was in `nbr` initially.**
