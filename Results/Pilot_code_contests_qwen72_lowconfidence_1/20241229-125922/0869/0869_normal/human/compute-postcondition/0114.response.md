The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature, but based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should accept an integer `n` and a list of `n` pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps. However, since the function signature does not reflect this, we will consider the function's expected behavior with respect to the described input and output.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- Each of the subsequent `n` lines contains pairs of distinct positive integers, where each integer is between 1 and 109.

Output:
- The function returns a result based on the processing of these pairs, although the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Since the exact output is not specified, we can only infer that the function processes the pairs of integers and returns some form of result. For the purpose of this description, we will assume the function returns a processed result based on the pairs of stamps.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of `n` pairs of distinct positive integers (stamps) and returns a result based on the processing of these pairs.**
