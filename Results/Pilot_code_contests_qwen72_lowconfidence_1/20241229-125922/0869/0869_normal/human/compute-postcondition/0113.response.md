The code snippet `print(' '.join(res))` prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. This does not alter any of the variables or the state of the program. The only action taken is the printing of the sequence of stamps visited.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged except for the fact that the sequence of stamps visited (`res`) is printed:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from the initial value of `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from the initial value of `v`, and `Q` is empty. The sequence of stamps visited (`res`) is printed.**
