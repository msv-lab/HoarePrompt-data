The code attempts to remove the first element of the list `l` from the set `cand`. However, since `cand` is initially an empty set, attempting to remove an element that does not exist will raise a `KeyError`.

Therefore, the output state should reflect that the operation fails and the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings from the input, and the first element of `l` is in `nbr`. An error occurs because `cand` is an empty set and `l[0]` cannot be removed.**
