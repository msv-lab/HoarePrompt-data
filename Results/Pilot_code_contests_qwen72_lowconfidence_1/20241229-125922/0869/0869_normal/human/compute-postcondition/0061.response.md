The value of `i` is appended to the list `Q`. This changes the state of `Q` from an empty list to a list containing the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the values of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i]`, `Q` is `[i]`, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` contains at least one element.**
