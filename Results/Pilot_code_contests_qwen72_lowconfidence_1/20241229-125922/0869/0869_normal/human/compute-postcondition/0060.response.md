The code `res.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `res`. 

- `res` was initially `[v]`, and now it will be `[v, i]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `i`, `nbr`, `cand`, `marked`, `Q`, and `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the values of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i]`, `Q` is an empty list, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` contains at least one element.**
