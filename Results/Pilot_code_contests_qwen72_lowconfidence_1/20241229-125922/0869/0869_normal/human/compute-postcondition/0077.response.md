Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` now contains at least one less element, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list, and `i` is not in `marked`.**
