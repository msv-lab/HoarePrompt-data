To ensure the loop can execute, we need to verify the conditions based on the provided state and the for loop statement.

- The variable `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), which means the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1 or more.
- The variables `nbr` and `cand` are initially empty and do not affect the loop's ability to execute.
- The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n-1`.

Given these points, the only condition that needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`nbr` and `cand`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not influence the loop's execution directly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `nbr` is an empty dictionary, `cand` is an empty set**
