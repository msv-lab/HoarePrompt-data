To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing at least one stamp that is not connected to any other stamp.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for v in cand:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `cand` set.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `cand` contains at least one stamp that is not connected to any other stamp.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **`cand` Set**: For the loop to execute one more time, the `cand` set must still contain at least one element.
- **`i` Value**: The value of `i` does not directly affect the loop condition, but it is part of the state. Since the loop is iterating over `cand`, `i` remains `n - 1` unless explicitly changed within the loop body.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `nbr` and `total` (if it exists) do not directly affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the `cand` set must still contain at least one element. The other variables (`i`, `nbr`, etc.) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing at least one stamp that is not connected to any other stamp, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
