The code snippet `Q.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`
- `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`
- `res` is `[v, i]`
- `Q` is an empty list if `i` is in `marked` or `[i]` if `i` is not in `marked`

After executing the code snippet, the list `Q` will contain the value `i` appended to its current contents.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v, i]`, `Q` is `[i]` if `i` was not in `marked` or `[i, i]` if `i` was already in `marked`**.
