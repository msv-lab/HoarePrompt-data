The code `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. This means `i` is now part of the set `marked`.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now added to `marked`.
- `nbr` remains a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`.
- `cand` remains a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` now contains the value of `v` and `i`.
- `res` remains `[v]` if `i` is in `marked` or `[v, i]` if `i` is not in `marked`.
- `Q` remains an empty list if `i` is in `marked` or `[i]` if `i` is not in `marked`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now in `marked`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and `i`, `res` is `[v]` if `i` is in `marked` or `[v, i]` if `i` is not in `marked`, `Q` is an empty list if `i` is in `marked` or `[i]` if `i` is not in `marked`.**
