The code initializes a new set called `marked`. This initialization does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `nbr`, or `cand`. The only change is the creation of the new set `marked`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is an empty set.**
