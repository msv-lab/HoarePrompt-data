The code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends the string `l[0]` to the list `nbr[l[1]]`. This operation modifies the dictionary `nbr` by adding `l[0]` to the list associated with the key `l[1]`.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `l` remains a list of strings from the input.
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`.
- After executing the code, `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]`. `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`.**
