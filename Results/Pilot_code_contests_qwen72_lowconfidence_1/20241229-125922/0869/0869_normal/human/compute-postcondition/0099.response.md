The code snippet `Q.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `Q`. Given the initial state, this operation updates the content of `Q` by appending the stamp `i` to it.

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is no longer relevant, but it was the first element in `nbr[v]` and is now included in both `marked` and `res`.
- `nbr` remains a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` remains a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` continues to contain all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`.
- `res` continues to contain the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`.
- `Q` now contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, plus the stamp `i`.
- `v` remains a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must not be empty, with `i` being the first element in `nbr[v]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped and now also includes `i`, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must not be empty, with `i` being the first element in `nbr[v]`.**
