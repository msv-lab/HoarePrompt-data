The code `marked.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `marked`. This operation does not affect the other variables directly, but it updates the state of `marked`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes the new `i`, `Q` now contains at least one less element plus the new `i` if `i` was not already in `marked`, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list, `i` is now included in `marked`.**
