The code snippet `marked.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `marked`. Since `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, and assuming `i` was not already in `marked`, `i` is now included in `marked`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.**
