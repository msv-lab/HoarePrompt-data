To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp, and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
- If `i` is not in `marked`, `i` is added to `marked`, `res`, and `Q`.
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`.
- `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the list `nbr[v]`, which contains the stamps connected to the stamp `v`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`.
   - `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v`.
   - `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited.
   - `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be set to the next element in `nbr[v]`.
- **`marked`**: If `i` is not already in `marked`, it will be added to `marked`.
- **`res`**: If `i` is not already in `res`, it will be added to `res`.
- **`Q`**: If `i` is not already in `Q`, it will be added to `Q`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `nbr[v]` must be considered. The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to the next element in `nbr[v]`.
- `marked` should be updated if `i` is not already in it.
- `res` should be updated if `i` is not already in it.
- `Q` should be updated if `i` is not already in it.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, and `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped. If `i` is not in `marked`, `i` is added to `marked`, `res`, and `Q`.**
