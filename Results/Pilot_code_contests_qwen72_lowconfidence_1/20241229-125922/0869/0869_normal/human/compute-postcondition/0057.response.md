To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the values in `nbr[v]`. For the loop to execute, `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
   - `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
   - `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`.
   - `res` is `[v]`.
   - `Q` is an empty list.
   - `v` is the value that was originally in `Q`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **`nbr[v]` must be non-empty**: For the loop to execute, `nbr[v]` must contain at least one element. This means that the stamp `v` must be connected to at least one other stamp.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop condition. The loop variable `i` will take the values from `nbr[v]`, not from the initial value of `i`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, the following conditions must be met:
- `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.
- `v` must be a valid key in the dictionary `nbr`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings representing the stamps connected to the key stamp `v`, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is an empty list, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` contains at least one element.**
