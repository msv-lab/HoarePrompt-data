The variable `Q` is initialized as a list containing the value of `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `v` is not provided, but it is implied that `v` is a stamp that is part of the `cand` set and also present in the `marked` set and the `res` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is `[v]`**
