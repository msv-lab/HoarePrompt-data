To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for v in cand:` will execute if and only if the set `cand` is not empty.

2. **Given State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
   - `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `nbr` remains an empty dictionary, and `cand` remains an empty set.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cand` must contain at least one element.
   - The state provided does not specify the contents of `cand` directly, but it implies that `cand` should be non-empty for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `cand` is not empty. Given that `cand` contains stamps that are not connected to any other stamp, we need to ensure that there is at least one such stamp.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing at least one stamp that is not connected to any other stamp.**
