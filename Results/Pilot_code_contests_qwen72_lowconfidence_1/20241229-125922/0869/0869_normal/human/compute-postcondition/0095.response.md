To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is no longer relevant
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`
- `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, and `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `nbr[v]` is not an empty list. This means that `v` must have at least one stamp connected to it in the `nbr` dictionary.
2. **Relevant Variables**:
   - `v`: The current stamp being processed.
   - `nbr[v]`: The list of stamps connected to `v`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`v` must be a key in `nbr`**: For the loop to execute, `v` must be a valid key in the `nbr` dictionary.
- **`nbr[v]` must not be empty**: The list of stamps connected to `v` must contain at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`**.
