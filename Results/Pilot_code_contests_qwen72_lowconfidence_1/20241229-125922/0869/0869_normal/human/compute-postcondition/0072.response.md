Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list of strings, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains the value of `v` and possibly `i` if it was not already in `marked`. If `i` is not in `marked`, `res` is `[v, i, i]` and `Q` is `[i]` with `i` appended to `Q`. Otherwise, `res` remains `[v, i]` and `Q` remains an empty list.***
