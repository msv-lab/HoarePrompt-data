The code snippet `res.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` and now includes `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`, `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped, `v` is a valid key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must not be empty, `i` is the first element in `nbr[v]`, and `i` is now in `marked`.**
