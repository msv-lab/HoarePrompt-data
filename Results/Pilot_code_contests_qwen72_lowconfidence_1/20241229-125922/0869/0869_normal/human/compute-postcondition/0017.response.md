The code `cand.remove(l[1])` removes the element `l[1]` from the set `cand`. Given the initial state, we need to consider the conditions under which this operation is valid.

- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, `cand` contains `{l[0]}`.
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, `cand` is an empty set.

Since the operation `cand.remove(l[1])` is being performed, it implies that `l[1]` must be in `cand`. This can only happen if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, making `cand` contain `{l[0]}`.

However, the code will raise a `KeyError` if `l[1]` is not in `cand`. Assuming the code does not raise an error, `l[1]` must be equal to `l[0]`.

Therefore, after executing the code, `cand` will be an empty set, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}`, and `cand` is an empty set, if `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]`, and `cand` is an empty set**.
