Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` is a dictionary. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` and `cand` contains the string `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `l[1]` appended to its existing values, and `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`.***
