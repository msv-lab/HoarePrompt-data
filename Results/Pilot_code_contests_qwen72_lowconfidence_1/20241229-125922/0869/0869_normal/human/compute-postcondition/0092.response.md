To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`.
- `Q` now contains at least one less element.
- `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    if i not in marked:
        marked.add(i)
        res.append(i)
        Q.append(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Iteration and Condition**: The loop iterates over each stamp `i` in the list `nbr[v]`. For each `i`, if `i` is not in `marked`, it is added to `marked`, appended to `res`, and pushed onto `Q`.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `marked`: After the loop, `marked` will contain all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
   - `res`: `res` will contain the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, including all stamps that were added to `marked` during the loop.
   - `Q`: `Q` will contain the stamps that were added to `Q` during the loop, which are the stamps that were not initially in `marked` and are connected to `v`.

3. **Final State**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `i` is no longer relevant as it is a loop variable.
   - `nbr` remains unchanged as it is the input dictionary.
   - `cand` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `marked` will contain all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
   - `res` will contain the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, including all stamps that were added to `marked` during the loop.
   - `Q` will contain the stamps that were added to `Q` during the loop, which are the stamps that were not initially in `marked` and are connected to `v`.
   - `v` remains the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is no longer relevant, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` contains the stamps that were added to `Q` during the loop, and `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped.**
