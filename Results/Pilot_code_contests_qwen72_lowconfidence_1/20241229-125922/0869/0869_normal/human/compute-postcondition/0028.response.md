The code snippet `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` modifies the dictionary `nbr` by appending the string `l[0]` to the list associated with the key `l[1]`. Here's the updated state considering the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 1
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- `nbr` is a dictionary. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` and `cand` contains the string `l[0]`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` is a list containing `l[1]` (if `nbr[l[0]]` was previously empty) or `l[1]` appended to its existing values, and `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`.

After executing `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])`:
- `nbr[l[1]]` now includes `l[0]` in its list.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `cand`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` (appended to its existing values if any), `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`.**
