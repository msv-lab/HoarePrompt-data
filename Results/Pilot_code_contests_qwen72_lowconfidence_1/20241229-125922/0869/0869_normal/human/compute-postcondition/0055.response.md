To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `len(Q) > 0` is true right before the loop starts.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state
- `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`
- `res` is `[v]`
- `Q` is `[v]`

The critical part is the state of `Q`. For the loop to execute, `Q` must contain at least one element. In the given state, `Q` is `[v]`, which means it contains one element (`v`). Therefore, the condition `len(Q) > 0` is already satisfied.

Since the condition is already met, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` is a set containing the value of `v`, `res` is `[v]`, `Q` is `[v]`**
