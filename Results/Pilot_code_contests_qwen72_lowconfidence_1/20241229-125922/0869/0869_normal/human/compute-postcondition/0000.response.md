The code snippet reads an input and assigns it to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 105. After executing the code, `n` is still a positive integer within the specified range, but its exact value depends on the input provided.

The rest of the initial state, which mentions that the subsequent `n` lines contain pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps, remains unchanged and is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) as input, and the subsequent `n` lines contain pairs of distinct positive integers representing the stamps, where each integer is between 1 and 109.**
