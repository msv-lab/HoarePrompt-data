Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`: 
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]` and `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` includes `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.
If `l[1]` is in `nbr`:
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]`, and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`.
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` does not include `l[0]` or `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` includes `l[0]`.***
