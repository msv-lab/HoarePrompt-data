The code snippet `res.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `res`. This impacts the `res` list, which already contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes the new `i`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now included in `marked`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` includes the new `i` in addition to its previous contents.
- `res` now contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and includes the new `i`.
- `Q` now contains at least one less element plus the new `i`.
- `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]` and is now included in `marked`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` includes the new `i` in addition to its previous contents, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes the new `i`, `Q` now contains at least one less element plus the new `i`, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.**
