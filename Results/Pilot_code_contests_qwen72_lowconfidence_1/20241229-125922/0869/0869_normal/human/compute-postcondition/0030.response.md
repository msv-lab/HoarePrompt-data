Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 1, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[1]` is not in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is set to `[l[0]]` and `cand` contains both `l[0]` (if `l[0]` was not in `nbr`) and `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is in `nbr`, `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]` appended to its existing values, `cand` contains the string `l[0]` if `l[0]` was not in `nbr` initially, otherwise `cand` does not contain the string `l[0]`, and `l[1]` has been removed from `cand`.***
