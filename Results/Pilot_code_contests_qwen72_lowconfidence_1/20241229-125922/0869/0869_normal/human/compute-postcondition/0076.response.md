To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`.
- `Q` now contains at least one less element.
- `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the list of stamps connected to `v` as defined in the `nbr` dictionary.
- For the loop to execute, `v` must be a key in the `nbr` dictionary, and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.

### Adjusted State:
- `v` must be a key in the `nbr` dictionary.
- `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list, meaning `v` must have at least one connected stamp.

### Conclusion:
The state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is that `v` must be a key in the `nbr` dictionary and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is `n - 1`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, `Q` now contains at least one less element, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list**
