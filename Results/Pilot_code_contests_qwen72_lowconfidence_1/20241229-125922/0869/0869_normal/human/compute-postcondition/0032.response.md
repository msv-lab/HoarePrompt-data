The code `l = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation updates the value of the variable `l` to this new list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is a list of strings from the input.
- `nbr` and `cand` are involved in conditions but their initial values are not specified.

After executing the code:
- `l` is updated to the list of strings obtained from the input.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The initial state of `nbr` and `cand` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr` and `cand` are unchanged.**
