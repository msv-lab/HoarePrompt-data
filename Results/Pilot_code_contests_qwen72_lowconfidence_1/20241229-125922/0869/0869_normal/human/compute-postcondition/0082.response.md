To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp.
- `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state.
- `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr`.
- If `i` is not in `marked`, `marked` includes `i`.
- `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes `i`.
- `Q` now contains at least one less element plus `n - 1`.
- `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in nbr[v]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute for each element in `nbr[v]`. Since `v` is a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute at least once.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nbr[v]`. Since `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be the next element in the list `nbr[v]`.
   - **`marked`**: If the new `i` is not already in `marked`, it will be added to `marked`.
   - **`res`**: The new `i` will be added to the sequence `res`.
   - **`Q`**: The queue `Q` will contain at least one less element plus the new `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`.
- `nbr` remains the same.
- `cand` remains the same.
- `marked` may include the new `i` if it was not already included.
- `res` will include the new `i`.
- `Q` will contain at least one less element plus the new `i`.
- `v` remains the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next element in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` may include the new `i` if it was not already included, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v` and now includes the new `i`, `Q` now contains at least one less element plus the new `i`, `v` is the value that was originally in `Q` and has been popped, and `v` must be a key in `nbr` and `nbr[v]` must be a non-empty list.**
