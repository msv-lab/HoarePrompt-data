The code `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the first element of the list `l` and the value is a list containing the second element of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}`, `cand` is an empty set, `l` is a list of strings from the input, and the first element of `l` is now a key in the dictionary `nbr`.**
