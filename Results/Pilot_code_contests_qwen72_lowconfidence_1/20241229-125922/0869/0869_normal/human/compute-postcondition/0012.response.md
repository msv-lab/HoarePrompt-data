Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input. If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}` and `cand` is a set containing `{l[0]}`. If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, and `cand` remains an empty set. Additionally, `l[1]` is not in `nbr`.***
