The code `nbr[l[1]].append(l[0])` appends the string `l[0]` to the list associated with the key `l[1]` in the dictionary `nbr`. This impacts the dictionary `nbr` and potentially the set `cand`, depending on the initial conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 0
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]]}` and `cand` is a set containing `{l[0]}`
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, and `cand` remains an empty set
- `l[1]` is in `nbr`

After executing the code:
- The list associated with the key `l[1]` in `nbr` now includes `l[0]` as one of its elements.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `i` is 0
- `l` is a list of strings from the input
- If `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` and `cand` is a set containing `{l[0]}`
- If `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]`, and `cand` remains an empty set

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is 0, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with `{l[0]: [l[1]], l[1]: [l[0]]}` and `cand` is a set containing `{l[0]}`, if `l[0]` is in `nbr`, then `nbr` is a dictionary with the key `l[0]` mapping to a list containing `l[1]`, and `nbr[l[1]]` is a list containing `l[0]`, and `cand` remains an empty set**
