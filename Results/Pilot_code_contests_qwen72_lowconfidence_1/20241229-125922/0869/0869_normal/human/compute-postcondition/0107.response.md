The code snippet `marked.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `marked`. This operation does not affect the other variables directly, but it changes the content of the `marked` set. Since `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, it means `i` is a string representing a stamp.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` now contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` including `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, and `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `i` is the next key in `nbr[v]`, `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a stamp and each value is a list of strings representing the stamps that are connected to the key stamp, `cand` is a set containing the stamps that are not connected to any other stamp in the final state, `marked` contains all stamps that are reachable from `v` through the connections defined in `nbr` including `i`, `res` contains the sequence of stamps visited starting from `v`, and `Q` contains at least one stamp after `v` has been popped.**
