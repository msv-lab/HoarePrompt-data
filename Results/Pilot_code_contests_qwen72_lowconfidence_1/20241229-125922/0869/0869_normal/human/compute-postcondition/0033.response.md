The code snippet `nbr[l[0]] = [l[1]]` updates the dictionary `nbr` by assigning the value `[l[1]]` to the key `l[0]`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `nbr` is updated such that the key `l[0]` now maps to a list containing the single element `l[1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `l`, `cand`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`, `cand` is unchanged.**
