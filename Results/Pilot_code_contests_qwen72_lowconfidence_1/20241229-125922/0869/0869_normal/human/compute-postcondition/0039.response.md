The code `cand.add(l[1])` adds the string `l[1]` to the set `cand`. This impacts the `cand` set, which now includes both `l[0]` and `l[1]` if `l[0]` was already in `cand`, or only `l[1]` if `l[0]` was not initially in `cand`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of strings from the input, if `l[0]` is not in `nbr`, then `cand` includes `l[0]` and `l[1]` and `nbr[l[0]]` is `[l[1]]`. Otherwise, `nbr[l[0]]` includes `l[1]` and `cand` includes `l[1]`. `nbr[l[1]]` is `[l[0]]`.**
