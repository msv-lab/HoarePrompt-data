Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input()`. This would cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.
   
2. **Identification of Starting Point:**
   - The program correctly identifies the starting point of the route by finding a city that appears only once in the input (i.e., a city with degree 1 in the graph). However, it assumes that the first element in the `cand` set is the starting point. This is not necessarily true because sets in Python do not maintain any particular order. The program should explicitly check and select the correct starting point, which is one of the two endpoints of the route.
   
3. **Output Format:**
   - The problem description requires the output to be a sequence of `n + 1` numbers representing the indices of the cities in one of the two possible routes. The program outputs the sequence of stamps (cities) visited during the DFS, but it does not guarantee that the output will be `n + 1` elements long. The length of the output should match the number of cities in the route, which is `n + 1`.

4. **Graph Construction:**
   - The program constructs the graph correctly using a dictionary where each key is a city and each value is a list of connected cities. However, it does not handle the case where the input might form a cycle, which is not allowed according to the problem description (the route should not contain any city more than once).

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
The program will construct a graph where each city is connected to the next, forming a cycle. The program will output a sequence of cities, but it will not necessarily be a valid route because the problem description specifies that the route should not contain any city more than once. Since the input forms a cycle, the program will not be able to produce a valid route.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and does not guarantee the output format as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
