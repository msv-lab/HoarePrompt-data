Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Input**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This could lead to runtime errors when the program is executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Queue Usage**: The program imports `Queue` but does not use it. Instead, it uses a simple list `Q` to simulate a queue. While this works, it is inconsistent with the import statement.

3. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph using a dictionary `nbr` where each key is a city and the value is a list of connected cities. However, the program incorrectly adds both directions of the edge to the graph. For example, if the input is `1 100`, the program will add `100` to the list of `1` and `1` to the list of `100`. This is correct, but the logic for adding and removing candidates (`cand`) is flawed. Specifically, the candidate set `cand` is used to identify the start of the route, but the logic for updating `cand` can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Candidate Selection**: The program assumes that the first element in `cand` is the starting city. However, if the input is such that multiple cities could be the starting point (which is theoretically possible in certain edge cases), the program may select the wrong starting city.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result using `print(' '.join(res))`, but the elements in `res` are still strings. According to the problem description, the output should be integers. The program should convert the elements in `res` to integers before joining them.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 4
```
However, the program might output:
```
4 3 2 1
```
This is because the program does not guarantee the correct order of the route, especially when multiple valid starting points exist.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Use `input()` instead of `raw_input()`.
- Ensure consistent use of data structures (e.g., avoid importing unused modules).
- Correctly handle the construction of the graph and the selection of the starting city.
- Convert the final list of cities to integers before printing.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
