You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Bob got a letter in an envelope. Bob knows that when Berland's post officers send a letter directly from city «A» to city «B», they stamp it with «A B», or «B A». Unfortunately, often it is impossible to send a letter directly from the city of the sender to the city of the receiver, that's why the letter is sent via some intermediate cities. Post officers never send a letter in such a way that the route of this letter contains some city more than once. Bob is sure that the post officers stamp the letters accurately.

There are n stamps on the envelope of Bob's letter. He understands that the possible routes of this letter are only two. But the stamps are numerous, and Bob can't determine himself none of these routes. That's why he asks you to help him. Find one of the possible routes of the letter.

Input

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — amount of mail stamps on the envelope. Then there follow n lines with two integers each — description of the stamps. Each stamp is described with indexes of the cities between which a letter is sent. The indexes of cities are integers from 1 to 109. Indexes of all the cities are different. Every time the letter is sent from one city to another, exactly one stamp is put on the envelope. It is guaranteed that the given stamps correspond to some valid route from some city to some other city. 

Output

Output n + 1 numbers — indexes of cities in one of the two possible routes of the letter.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw that can cause it to fail for certain inputs. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the graph formed by the stamps is not a simple path but rather a more complex structure. For example, consider a case where the stamps form a cycle or a more complex tree-like structure. The program assumes that the starting point is always a node with a degree of 1 (i.e., a leaf node), and it uses this assumption to build the path. However, if the graph is not a simple path, this assumption can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 
or
4 3 2 1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output an incorrect path because it will start from a node with degree 1 (which doesn't exist in this case) and will not correctly traverse the cycle.

This example demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    print(' '.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of `n` pairs of distinct positive integers (stamps) from the standard input. Each pair represents a connection between two stamps. The function constructs a graph where each stamp is a node and each pair represents an undirected edge between two nodes. It identifies the set of stamps that are not connected to any other stamp (`cand`). If there are any such stamps, it selects one and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that stamp to find all connected stamps. The function then prints the sequence of stamps visited during the DFS in the order they were visited. If no unconnected stamps exist, the function will still perform a DFS starting from an arbitrary stamp, but the behavior is not clearly defined in the code (it will start from the first stamp in the `cand` set, which may be empty). The final state of the program includes a dictionary `nbr` representing the graph, a set `cand` of unconnected stamps, a set `marked` of visited stamps, and a list `res` of the sequence of stamps visited during the DFS. If `n` is 0, the function will print an empty list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
