### Analysis of the Program

The program aims to reconstruct one of the two possible routes of a letter based on the stamps on the envelope. Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness according to the problem description.

#### Input Handling
- The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of stamps.
- It then reads `n` lines, each containing a pair of integers representing the stamps.

#### Data Structures
- `nbr` is a dictionary where each key is a city index, and the value is a list of cities that are directly connected to the key city.
- `cand` is a set that keeps track of potential starting cities (cities that have only one connection).

#### Logic
1. **Building the Graph:**
   - For each stamp, the program updates the `nbr` dictionary to add the connection between the two cities.
   - It also updates the `cand` set to keep track of cities that have only one connection. If a city has more than one connection, it is removed from `cand`.

2. **Finding the Starting City:**
   - The program selects a starting city from the `cand` set. Since `cand` should contain exactly two cities (the start and end of the route), selecting one of them is sufficient.

3. **Reconstructing the Route:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph starting from the selected city.
   - It maintains a `marked` set to keep track of visited cities and a `res` list to store the route.
   - The `Q` list is used as a stack to manage the DFS traversal.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the reconstructed route.

### Verification

#### Correctness of the Algorithm
- **Graph Construction:** The program correctly builds the adjacency list representation of the graph using the `nbr` dictionary.
- **Identifying Start and End Cities:** The `cand` set is used to identify the start and end cities of the route. Since the route is a valid path without cycles, there will be exactly two cities with one connection each.
- **Route Reconstruction:** The DFS approach ensures that the program correctly traverses the graph and constructs the route from the starting city to the end city.

#### Edge Cases
- **Single Stamp (n = 1):** The program correctly handles the case where there is only one stamp. In this case, the route will be the two cities mentioned in the stamp.
- **Multiple Stamps (n > 1):** The program correctly handles multiple stamps and reconstructs the route as expected.

#### Potential Issues
- **Input Format:** The program assumes the input format is correct and does not handle invalid input. However, as per the problem description, we assume valid input.
- **Data Types:** The program uses `raw_input()` and splits the input into strings. This is appropriate since the city indices are represented as strings in the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It constructs the graph, identifies the start and end cities, and reconstructs the route using a DFS approach. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
