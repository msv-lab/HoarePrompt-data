The value of `c` is updated to a list containing the value `3` repeated `(n - 2)` times. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes**
