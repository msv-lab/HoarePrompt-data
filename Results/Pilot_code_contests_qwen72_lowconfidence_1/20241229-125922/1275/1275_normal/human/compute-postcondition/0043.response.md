The given Python code initializes a list of lists named `con` where each inner list is empty. The number of these inner lists is determined by `n + 1`, where `n` is an input integer. This operation does not modify the values of `n`, `a`, or `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**
