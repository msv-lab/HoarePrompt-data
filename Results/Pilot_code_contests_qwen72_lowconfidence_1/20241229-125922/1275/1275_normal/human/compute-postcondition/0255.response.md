To accurately describe the functionality of `func_1`, let's first identify the parameters it should accept based on the problem description:

1. **Number of Test Cases (`T`)**: This indicates how many different scenarios or sets of inputs the function will process.
2. **Number of Vertices (`N`)**: This represents the number of vertices in the cake, which is essential for understanding the structure of the cake.
3. **Details of Triangular Pieces**: This could be a list or array of tuples, where each tuple represents a triangular piece cut from the cake, including its vertices.

Given these parameters, the function `func_1` should process each test case and determine some output based on the number of vertices and the details of the triangular pieces.

### Functionality Description:
The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `T` (integer): The number of test cases.
- `N` (integer): The number of vertices in the cake.
- `pieces` (list of tuples): Each tuple contains the vertices of a triangular piece cut from the cake.

The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the number of vertices and the details of the triangular pieces.

### Example Output Cases:
- **Case_1**: If the input is invalid (e.g., negative `N` or invalid piece coordinates), the function returns an error message.
- **Case_2**: If the input is valid, the function returns a specific result (e.g., the number of valid triangular pieces or some other calculated value).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of test cases `T`, the number of vertices `N`, and the details of the triangular pieces, and return the appropriate result for each test case based on the input validation and processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `T`, the number of vertices `N`, and the details of the triangular pieces. It returns an error message if the input is invalid. Otherwise, it returns a specific result for each test case based on the number of vertices and the details of the triangular pieces.**
