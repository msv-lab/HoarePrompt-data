The code `s[z, y].add(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 0) to the set `s[z, y]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3.
- `a` is a list of tuples with at least one element.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values.
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is the first tuple in `a`.
- `x` is the first element of `t`.
- `y` is the second element of `t`.
- `z` is the third element of `t`.
- If `x` is less than `y`, `s[x, y]` contains the set `{0}`.
- If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `s[y, x]` contains the set `{0}`.
- `y` is greater than or equal to `z`.

After executing the code:
- The set `s[z, y]` now contains the value `0` (since `i` is 0).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of tuples with at least one element, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `i` is 0, `t` is the first tuple in `a`, `x` is the first element of `t`, `y` is the second element of `t`, `z` is the third element of `t`, if `x` is less than `y`, `s[x, y]` contains the set `{0}`, if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `s[y, x]` contains the set `{0}`, `y` is greater than or equal to `z`, `s[z, y]` contains the set `{0}`.**
