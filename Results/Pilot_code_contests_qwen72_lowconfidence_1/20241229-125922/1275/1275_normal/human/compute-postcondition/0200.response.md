The code `d[x] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element in the list `d` at the index specified by `x`. Given that `x` is 1, this means `d[1]` is set to 1. The length of `d` is `n + 1`, and it was initially filled with zeros. After executing the code, only `d[1]` is updated to 1, while the rest of the elements in `d` remain 0.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is an empty list, `x` is 1, `d` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, `i` is 0**
