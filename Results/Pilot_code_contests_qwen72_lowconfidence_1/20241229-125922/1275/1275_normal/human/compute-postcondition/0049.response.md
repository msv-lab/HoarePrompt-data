Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`. The current length of `v` is 1.***
