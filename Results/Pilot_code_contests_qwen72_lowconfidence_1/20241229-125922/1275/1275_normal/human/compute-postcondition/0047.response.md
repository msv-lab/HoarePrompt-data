The code snippet `pu = st.append` assigns the method `append` of the list `st` to the variable `pu`. This does not change the content of `st` itself or any other variable's content directly. It only changes the reference `pu` to point to the `append` method of `st`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes, `st` is an empty list, an `IndexError` occurs due to attempting to pop from an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`.**
