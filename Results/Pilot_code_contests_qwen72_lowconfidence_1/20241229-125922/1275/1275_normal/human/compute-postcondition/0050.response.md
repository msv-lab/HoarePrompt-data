The value of `i` is assigned the element popped from the list `v`. Since the initial length of `v` is 1, after popping, `v` becomes an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `i` is the value that was in `v` before the pop operation.**
