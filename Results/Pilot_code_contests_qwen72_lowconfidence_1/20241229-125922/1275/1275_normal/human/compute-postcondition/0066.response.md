The code `con[x].append(y)` adds the value `y` to the list `con[x]`. This impacts the state of the `con` list specifically at the index `x`.

Let's go through the changes step by step:

- The value of `con[x]` is updated by appending `y` to it.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `c`, `st`, `pu`, `v`, `x`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least two key-value pairs, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, and `con[y]` now includes `x`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1, `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`), `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`, if `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains `i` twice, if `len(v) == 1`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, and `i` is the value that was previously in `v`.**
