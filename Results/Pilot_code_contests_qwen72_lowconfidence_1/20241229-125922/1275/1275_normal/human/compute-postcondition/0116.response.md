Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `c[i]` is 0, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1. If `c[j]` is 1, `j` is appended to `st`, `q` contains `y` or `z` or `x` based on the conditions, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers from the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `i` is removed from the set `s[k]`, `j` is an element that was in the set `s[k]` before being popped, `s[k]` has one fewer element, and the current value of `c[j]` is 1.***
