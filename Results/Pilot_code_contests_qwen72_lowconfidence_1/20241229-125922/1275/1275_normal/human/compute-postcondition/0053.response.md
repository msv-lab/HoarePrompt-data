The value of `i` is appended to the list `st` using the `pu` method, which is the `append` method of `st`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2, but now the current value of `c[i]` is 1, `st` is a list containing `i`, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `i` is the value that was in `v` before the pop operation.**
