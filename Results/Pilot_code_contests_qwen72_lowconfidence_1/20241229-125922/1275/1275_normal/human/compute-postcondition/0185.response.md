The value of `c[j]` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was the value removed from the set `s[k]`, the value of `c[j]` is now `c[j] - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where the value at index `i` has been decremented by 1, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `i` is the value returned by `po()`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the elements of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `k` is the tuple determined by the conditions specified, `s[k]` has one less element, `j` is the value removed from the set `s[k]`, `c[j]` is now `c[j] - 1`.
