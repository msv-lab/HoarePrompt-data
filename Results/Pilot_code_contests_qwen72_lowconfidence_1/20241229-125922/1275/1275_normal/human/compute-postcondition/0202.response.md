To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers.
- `st` is an empty list.
- `pu` is the append method of `st`.
- `q` is a list of integers.
- `p` is `[1]`.
- `x` is 1.
- `d` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`.
- `i` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for y in con[x]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `con[x]`.
- `x` is currently 1, so the loop will iterate over `con[1]`.
- For the loop to execute, `con[1]` must be a non-empty list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- We need to ensure that `con[1]` is a non-empty list. This is because if `con[1]` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[1]` must be non-empty, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is `[1]`, `x` is 1, `d` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, `i` is 0**
