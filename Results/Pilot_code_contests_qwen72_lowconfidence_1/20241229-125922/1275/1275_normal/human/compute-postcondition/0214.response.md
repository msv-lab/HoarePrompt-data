Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[1]` must be non-empty, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is `[1]`, `x` is 1, `d` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, `i` is 0, `y` is the next element in `con[1]` after the current `y`. If `d[y]` is 0, `x` is updated to the next element in `con[1]` after the current `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
