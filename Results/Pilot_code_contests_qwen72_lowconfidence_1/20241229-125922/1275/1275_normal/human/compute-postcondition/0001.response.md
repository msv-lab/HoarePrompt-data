The code snippet reads `n-2` lines from standard input, splits each line into parts, converts each part to an integer, and appends the resulting tuple to the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, each containing integers from the input lines, and the length of `a` is `n-2`.**
