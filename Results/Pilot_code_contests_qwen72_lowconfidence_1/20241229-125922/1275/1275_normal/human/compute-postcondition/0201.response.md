The code `p.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `p`. Given that `x` is 1, this means that `1` is appended to the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `p` is an empty list, so after appending `1`, `p` becomes `[1]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is `[1]`, `x` is 1, `d` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, `i` is 0**
