Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2. If `c[i]` is 1, then the current value of `c[i]` remains 1, `st` is a list containing `i`, `pu` is the append method of `st`, and `v` is an empty list. If `c[i]` is not 1, the values of `c[i]`, `st`, `pu`, and `v` remain unchanged.***
