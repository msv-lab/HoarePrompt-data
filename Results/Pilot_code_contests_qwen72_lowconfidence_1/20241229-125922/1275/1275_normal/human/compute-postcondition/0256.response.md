Functionality: ** The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output. Specifically, it reads the number of vertices `n` and a list of `n-2` tuples representing triangular pieces of a cake. It constructs a graph using these pieces and performs a series of operations to determine two sequences: `p` and `q`. The sequence `p` represents a traversal order of the vertices, and `q` represents additional derived values based on the triangular pieces. After processing, the function prints both sequences to standard output. The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid cases explicitly. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is less than 3, which would result in no triangular pieces being processed, and the behavior in such cases is undefined. Additionally, the function does not validate the input format or check for consistency in the triangular pieces, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is malformed. **
