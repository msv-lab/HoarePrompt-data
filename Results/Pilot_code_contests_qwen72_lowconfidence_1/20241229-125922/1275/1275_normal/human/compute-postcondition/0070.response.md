The value of `c[i]` is decremented by 1. Since `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1, decrementing `c[i]` by 1 results in `c[i]` being 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one more key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is now 0, `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`), `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is a list with one less element, `x` is the first element of the next `k`, `y` is the second element of the next `k`, `i` is the last element of the original `v`**
