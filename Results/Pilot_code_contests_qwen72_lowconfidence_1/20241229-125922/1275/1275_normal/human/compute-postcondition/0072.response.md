Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one more key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is now 0, `st` is a list containing `i`. If `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains an additional `i`, making it contain `i` twice. `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is a list with one less element, `x` is the first element of the next `k`, `y` is the second element of the next `k`, `i` is the last element of the original `v`.***
