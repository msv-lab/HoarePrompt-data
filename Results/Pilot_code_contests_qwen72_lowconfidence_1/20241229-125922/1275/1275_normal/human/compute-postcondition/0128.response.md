Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, and `q` is a list. If `c[i]` is 1, `c[i]` is set to 0, and if `c[j]` is 1, `j` is appended to `st`. Additionally, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers from the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `i` is removed from the set `s[k]`, `j` is an element that was in the set `s[k]` before being popped, `s[k]` has one fewer element, and the current value of `c[j]` is 1. If `c[i]` is not 1, `i` remains undefined due to an undefined function `po()`, and `x`, `y`, and `z` are undefined. If `x` is defined and not in `q`, then `x` is added to `q`. If `x` is defined and in `q`, and `y` is not in `q`, then `y` is not in `q`. If `x` is defined and in `q`, and `y` is in `q`, then `q` contains `z`.***
