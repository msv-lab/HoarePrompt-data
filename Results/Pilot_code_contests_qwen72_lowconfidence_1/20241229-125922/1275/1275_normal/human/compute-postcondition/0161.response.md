Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list. If `c[i]` is 1, then `c[j]` is decremented by 1, and if `c[j]` is 1, `j` is added to `st` and `j` is the element popped from `s[k]`. If `c[i]` is not 1, and `x` is not in `q`, then `x` is appended to `q`. If `x` is in `q` and `y` is not in `q`, then `y` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, `z` is appended to `q`.***
