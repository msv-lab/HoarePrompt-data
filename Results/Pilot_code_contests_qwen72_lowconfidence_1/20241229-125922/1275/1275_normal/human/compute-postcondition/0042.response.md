Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values. For each tuple `(x, y, z)` in `a`, the following conditions hold for the keys in `s`:**
- **If `x < y`, `s[x, y]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true. If `x >= y`, `s[y, x]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true.**
- **If `y < z`, `s[y, z]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true. If `y >= z`, `s[z, y]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true.**
- **If `x < z`, `s[x, z]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true. If `x >= z`, `s[z, x]` contains the set of indices `{i}` for which this condition is true.**
- **If `a` is an empty list, `s` remains an empty `defaultdict`.**
