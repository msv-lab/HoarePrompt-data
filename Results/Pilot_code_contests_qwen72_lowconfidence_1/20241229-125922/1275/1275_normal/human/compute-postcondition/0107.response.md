Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers from the tuple at index `i` of `a`. If `y < z` and `i` is in `s[y, z]`, then `q` contains the value `x` and `k` is `(y, z)`. Otherwise, if `y > z` and `i` is in `s[z, y]`, then `q` contains the integer `x` and `k` is `(z, y)`. If neither of these conditions holds, `q` contains the integer `y`, and if `x < z` and `i` is in `s[x, z]`, then `k` is `(x, z)`. If none of these conditions hold, `k` is `(z, x)`.***
