The code `p.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `p`. Given that `p` was initially `[1, x]`, after appending `x` to `p`, the new value of `p` will be `[1, x, x]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is `[1, x, x]`, `x` is the last element in `con` for which `d[y]` was `False` or remains 1 if no such `y` exists, `d` is `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)` with `d[x]` set to `1`, `i` is 2**
