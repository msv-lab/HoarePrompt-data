Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of tuples with at least two elements, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `i` is 1, `t` is the second tuple in `a`, `x` is the first element of `t`, `y` is the second element of `t`, `z` is the third element of `t`. If `x < y`, `s[x, y]` contains the set `{1}`. If `x >= y`, `s[y, x]` contains the set `{1}`. If `y < z`, `s[y, z]` contains the set `{1}`. If `y >= z`, `s[z, y]` contains the set `{1}`. If `x < z`, `s[x, z]` contains the set `{1}`. If `x >= z`, `s[z, x]` contains the set `{1}`. Regardless of whether `y < z` or `y >= z`, the sets in `s` remain consistent with these conditions.***
