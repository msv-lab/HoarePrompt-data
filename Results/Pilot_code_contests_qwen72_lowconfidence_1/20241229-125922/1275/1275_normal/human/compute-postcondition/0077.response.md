Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` is a list containing elements `i` that were popped from `v` in `s` and had `c[i]` decrement to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`. If no elements in `s` have a set with a single element, `st` remains an empty list and `c` retains its original values.**
