The code snippet `con[x].append(y)` modifies the list `con[x]` by appending the value of `y` to it. Here's the detailed impact:

- `con[x]` is modified by adding `y` to the list.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, and the length of `a` is `n-2`.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[y]` now includes `x`.
- `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2. If `c[i]` is 1, then the current value of `c[i]` remains 1.
- `st` is a list containing `i`.
- `pu` is the append method of `st`.
- `v` is an empty list.
- `x` is the first element of `k`.
- `y` is the second element of `k`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `con[x]` now includes `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[y]` now includes `x` and `con[x]` now includes `y`, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2. If `c[i]` is 1, then the current value of `c[i]` remains 1, `st` is a list containing `i`, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`.**
