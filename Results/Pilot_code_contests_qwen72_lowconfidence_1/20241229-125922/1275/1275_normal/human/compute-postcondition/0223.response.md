Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers, `p` is `[1, x]`, `x` is the first element `y` in `con[1]` for which `d[y]` is `False` or remains 1 if no such `y` exists, `d` is `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)` with `d[x]` set to `1`, `i` is 1, `con[1]` must be a non-empty list. If `d[y]` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
