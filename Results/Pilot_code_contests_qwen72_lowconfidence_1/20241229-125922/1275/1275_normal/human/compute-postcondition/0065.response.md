The line of code `con[y].append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list located at index `y` in the `con` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least two key-value pairs.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1.
- `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`).
- `pu` is the append method of `st`.
- `v` is an empty list.
- `x` is the first element of `k`.
- `y` is the second element of `k`.
- If `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains `i` twice.
- If `len(v) == 1`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, and `i` is the value that was previously in `v`.

After executing `con[y].append(x)`, the following changes occur:
- The list at index `y` in `con` now includes the value of `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of tuples.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least two key-value pairs.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, and `con[y]` now includes `x`.
- `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1.
- `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`).
- `pu` is the append method of `st`.
- `v` is an empty list.
- `x` is the first element of `k`.
- `y` is the second element of `k`.
- If `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains `i` twice.
- If `len(v) == 1`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, and `i` is the value that was previously in `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least two key-value pairs, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, and `con[y]` now includes `x`, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1, `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`), `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`, if `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains `i` twice, if `len(v) == 1`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, and `i` is the value that was previously in `v`.**
