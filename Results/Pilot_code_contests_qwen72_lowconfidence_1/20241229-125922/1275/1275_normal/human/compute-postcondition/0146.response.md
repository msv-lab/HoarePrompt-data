Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list, `i` is undefined, `x` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `z` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`. If `y < z` and `i` is in `s[y, z]`, then `q` contains the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` and `k` is the tuple `(y, z)`. Otherwise, if `y > z` and `i` is in `s[z, y]`, then `q` contains the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` and `k` is a tuple `(z, y)`. If neither condition is met, and `x < z` and `i` is in `s[x, z]`, then `q` contains the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` and `k` is a tuple `(x, z)`. If none of these conditions are met, `q` contains the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`.***
