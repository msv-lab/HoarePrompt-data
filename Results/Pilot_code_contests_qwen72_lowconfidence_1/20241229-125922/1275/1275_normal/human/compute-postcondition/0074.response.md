The code `con[y].append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list located at index `y` in the list `con`.

- `x` is the first element of `k`.
- `y` is the second element of `k`.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists.

After executing the code, the list at index `y` in `con` will have `x` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one more key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is now 0, `st` is a list containing `i`. If `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains an additional `i`, making it contain `i` twice, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is a list with one less element, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`, `i` is the last element of the original `v`, `con[y]` now includes `x` as its last element.**
