The code `con[y].append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list located at index `y` in the `con` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`.
- `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair.
- `con` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2. If `c[i]` is 1, then the current value of `c[i]` remains 1.
- `st` is a list containing `i`.
- `pu` is the append method of `st`.
- `v` is an empty list.
- `x` is the first element of `k`.
- `y` is the second element of `k`.

After executing the code `con[y].append(x)`, the list at index `y` in `con` will have `x` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least one key-value pair, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[y]` now includes `x`, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 2. If `c[i]` is 1, then the current value of `c[i]` remains 1, `st` is a list containing `i`, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`.**
