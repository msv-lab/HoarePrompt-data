Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `con[x]` must contain at least one element, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers, `st` is an empty list, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list of integers. If `d[y]` is `False`, `p` is set to `[1, y, y]` and `d[y]` is set to `1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[y]` is `True`, `p` remains `[1, x, x]`. In both cases, `x` is the next element in `con[x]`, `d` is `[0, 1] + [0] * (n - 1)` with `d[x]` set to `1`, and `i` is 2.***
