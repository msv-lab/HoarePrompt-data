Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list containing the integer `y`, `i` is undefined due to an undefined function `po()`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers from the tuple at index `i` of `a`, and either `x <= y` or `i` is not in `s[y, x]`. Additionally, either `y >= z` or `i` is not in `s[y, z]`. The condition `(y > z and i in s[z, y])` is false. If `x < z and i in s[x, z]`, then `k` is `(x, z)`. Otherwise, `k` is `(z, x)`.***
