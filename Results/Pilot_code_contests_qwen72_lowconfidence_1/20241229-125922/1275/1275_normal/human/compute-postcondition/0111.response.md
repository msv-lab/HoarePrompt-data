The code `s[k].remove(i)` impacts the `defaultdict` `s` by removing the value `i` from the set corresponding to the key `k`.

Let's analyze the effect:

- `k` is determined based on the conditions provided. It could be `(x, y)`, `(y, x)`, `(y, z)`, `(z, y)`, `(x, z)`, or `(z, x)` depending on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and the presence of `i` in the sets `s[x, y]`, `s[y, x]`, etc.
- The value `i` is removed from the set `s[k]`.

Given this, the only change in the state is the removal of `i` from the set `s[k]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `c[i]` is 0, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` contains `y` or `z` or `x` based on the conditions, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the integers from the tuple at index `i` of `a`, `i` is removed from the set `s[k]`**.
