Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1, `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list. If `y` is not in `q`, then `y` is added to `q`. Otherwise, `z` is added to `q`. In both cases, `i` is the value returned by `po()`, and `x`, `y`, and `z` are the elements of the tuple at index `i` in `a`.***
