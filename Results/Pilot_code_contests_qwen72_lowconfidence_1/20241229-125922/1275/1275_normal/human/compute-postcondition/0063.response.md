Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, and the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values and must have at least two key-value pairs, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` threes except `c[i]` which is 1, `st` is a list containing `i` (or `i` and `i` if `c[i] == 1`), `pu` is the append method of `st`, `v` is an empty list, `x` is the first element of `k`, `y` is the second element of `k`. If `c[i] == 1`, `st` contains `i` twice. If `len(v) == 1`, `con[x]` now includes `y`, and `i` is the value that was previously in `v`.***
