Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers, the length of `a` is `n-2`, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `con` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list contains elements that were appended during the loop, `c` is a list of `(n - 2)` integers where each value has been decremented based on the loop's operations and `c[j]` is decremented by 1, `st` contains at least one element `i` such that `c[i]` has been decremented to 1. If `c[j]` is 1, then `st` also contains `j`, and `j` is the element popped from `s[k]`. `pu` is the append method of `st`, `q` is a list, `i` is undefined, `x` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `z` is the third element of the tuple at index `i` in `a`, `k` is the tuple determined by the conditions, and `s[k]` does not contain `i`.***
