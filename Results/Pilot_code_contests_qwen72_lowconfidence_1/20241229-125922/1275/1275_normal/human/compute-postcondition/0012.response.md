Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `a` is a list of tuples with at least one element, `s` is a `defaultdict` with sets as default values, `i` is 0, `t` is the first tuple in `a`, `x` is the first element of `t`, `y` is the second element of `t`, `z` is the third element of `t`. If `x` is less than `y`, `s[x, y]` contains the set `{0}`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `s[y, x]` contains the set `{0}`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `z`.***
