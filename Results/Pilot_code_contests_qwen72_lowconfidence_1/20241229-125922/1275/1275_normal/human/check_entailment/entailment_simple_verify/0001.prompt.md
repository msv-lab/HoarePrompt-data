You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We are committed to the well being of all participants. Therefore, instead of the problem, we suggest you enjoy a piece of cake.

Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. We told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back. Of course, before you taste the cake, you thought about how the cake was cut.

It is known that the cake was originally a regular n-sided polygon, each vertex of which had a unique number from 1 to n. The vertices were numbered in random order.

Each piece of the cake is a triangle. The cake was cut into n - 2 pieces as follows: each time one cut was made with a knife (from one vertex to another) such that exactly one triangular piece was separated from the current cake, and the rest continued to be a convex polygon. In other words, each time three consecutive vertices of the polygon were selected and the corresponding triangle was cut off.

A possible process of cutting the cake is presented in the picture below.

<image> Example of 6-sided cake slicing.

You are given a set of n-2 triangular pieces in random order. The vertices of each piece are given in random order — clockwise or counterclockwise. Each piece is defined by three numbers — the numbers of the corresponding n-sided cake vertices.

For example, for the situation in the picture above, you could be given a set of pieces: [3, 6, 5], [5, 2, 4], [5, 4, 6], [6, 3, 1].

You are interested in two questions.

  * What was the enumeration of the n-sided cake vertices? 
  * In what order were the pieces cut? 



Formally, you have to find two permutations p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) and q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2} (1 ≤ q_i ≤ n - 2) such that if the cake vertices are numbered with the numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n in order clockwise or counterclockwise, then when cutting pieces of the cake in the order q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2} always cuts off a triangular piece so that the remaining part forms one convex polygon.

For example, in the picture above the answer permutations could be: p=[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5] (or any of its cyclic shifts, or its reversal and after that any cyclic shift) and q=[2, 4, 1, 3].

Write a program that, based on the given triangular pieces, finds any suitable permutations p and q.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then there are t independent sets of input data.

The first line of each set consists of a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the cake.

The following n - 2 lines describe the numbers of the pieces vertices: each line consists of three different integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n) — the numbers of the pieces vertices of cake given in random order. The pieces are given in random order.

It is guaranteed that the answer to each of the tests exists. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

Print 2t lines — answers to given t test cases in the order in which they are written in the input. Each answer should consist of 2 lines.

In the first line of an answer on a test case print n distinct numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n(1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the numbers of the cake vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order.

In the second line of an answer on a test case print n - 2 distinct numbers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2}(1 ≤ q_i ≤ n - 2) — the order of cutting pieces of the cake. The number of a piece of the cake corresponds to its number in the input.

If there are several answers, print any. It is guaranteed that the answer to each of the tests exists.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Reading and Data Structures Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the triangular pieces.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to store the edges of the triangles and their corresponding indices.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs a graph where each vertex is connected to its neighbors based on the triangular pieces.
   - It initializes a list `c` to keep track of the number of edges each triangle has left to be processed.
   - It initializes a stack `st` to keep track of the triangles that can be processed next.

3. **Processing Triangles**:
   - The program iteratively processes the triangles, removing them from the graph and updating the list `q` which represents the order of cutting.
   - It ensures that the remaining part of the cake remains a convex polygon by maintaining the correct order of vertices.

4. **Reconstructing the Permutations**:
   - After processing all the triangles, the program reconstructs the permutation `p` of the vertices.
   - It ensures that the vertices are listed in the correct order (clockwise or counterclockwise).

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the permutations `p` and `q` for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description. It correctly processes the input and produces the required output for each test case. Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed steps taken by the program, it appears to be correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem. The correct function definition should accept the necessary parameters to solve the problem described. The expected function signature should include parameters for the input data, such as the number of test cases, the number of vertices in the cake, and the details of the triangular pieces.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
