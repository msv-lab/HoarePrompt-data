Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined and called correctly for each test case. The function reads the input for each test case and processes it as required by the problem description.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to store the edges of the triangles and their corresponding indices. This helps in efficiently managing the relationships between the vertices and the triangles.
   - The list `c` is used to keep track of the number of edges each triangle has left to be processed, ensuring that the program can correctly identify and process the triangles in the correct order.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs the graph by adding edges to the `defaultdict` `s` and initializing the adjacency list `con` and the count list `c`.
   - The stack `st` is used to manage the triangles that can be processed next, ensuring that the program maintains the correct order of operations.

4. **Processing Triangles**:
   - The program iteratively processes the triangles, removing them from the graph and updating the list `q` which represents the order of cutting.
   - The conditions within the loop ensure that the remaining part of the cake remains a convex polygon by maintaining the correct order of vertices.

5. **Reconstructing the Permutations**:
   - After processing all the triangles, the program reconstructs the permutation `p` of the vertices.
   - The vertices are listed in the correct order (clockwise or counterclockwise) by traversing the adjacency list `con`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the permutations `p` and `q` for each test case, as required by the problem description.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code confirm the correctness of the program at various stages of execution. The program correctly handles the input, processes the data, and produces the required output. The annotations show that the state of the program is consistent with the problem requirements and the logic of the program.

Given the detailed breakdown and the consistency with the problem description, the original assessment of **True** is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
