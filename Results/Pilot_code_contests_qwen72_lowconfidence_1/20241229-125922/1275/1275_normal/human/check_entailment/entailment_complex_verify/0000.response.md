Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but upon closer inspection of the annotated version of the code, there are several issues that indicate the program may not be fully correct:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is called without any parameters, but it reads input directly from `stdin`. This is not a typical way to structure a function for reusability and testing. However, since the problem specifies that the input is always valid, this might not be a critical issue.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases, such as when `n` is less than 3. While the problem guarantees that `n` will be at least 3, it's good practice to handle such cases explicitly.
   - The function does not validate the input format or check for consistency in the triangular pieces. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is malformed, even though the problem guarantees valid input.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph construction using `defaultdict` and sets is correct, but the logic for identifying the starting point and processing the pieces is complex and not entirely clear. The use of the stack `st` and the conditions inside the while loop are particularly intricate.

4. **Reconstruction Logic**:
   - The logic for reconstructing the vertex order and the order of cutting pieces is not straightforward. The conditions inside the while loop, especially the `if` statements, are complex and could potentially miss some edge cases or lead to incorrect results.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is written directly to `stdout`, which is consistent with the problem's requirements. However, the program does not handle the case where the input might be invalid, even though the problem guarantees valid input.

Given these observations, the original assessment of **True** is not accurate because the program's logic is complex and not fully validated. The annotations reveal that the program's behavior is not entirely clear and could potentially fail in certain scenarios, even though the problem guarantees valid input. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
