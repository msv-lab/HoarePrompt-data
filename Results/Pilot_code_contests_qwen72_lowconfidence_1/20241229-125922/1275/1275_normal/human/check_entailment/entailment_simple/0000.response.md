Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of reconstructing the original polygon and the order of cutting the pieces, but it has several issues that prevent it from correctly meeting the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Function Definition and Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, but the function itself needs to handle the input data. The function should accept parameters like `n` and the list of triangles. This is a fundamental issue that would cause the program to fail at runtime.

2. **Handling Input**:
   - The program reads input using `stdin.readline()`, but it does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is not designed to read the input data, and the input reading logic outside the function is incomplete and incorrect.

3. **Logic for Reconstructing the Polygon and Cutting Order**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `s` to store edges and their corresponding triangles, but the logic for reconstructing the polygon and the cutting order is flawed. The program does not correctly identify the vertices of the polygon in the correct order or the order in which the pieces were cut.
   - The use of `s.viewitems()` is incorrect because `viewitems()` is not a method in Python 3. The correct method is `items()`.
   - The logic for updating the `q` list (the cutting order) and the `p` list (the polygon vertices) is not clear and does not guarantee that the correct permutations are found.

4. **Output**:
   - The program writes the results using `stdout.write()`, but it does not ensure that the output is formatted correctly as required by the problem description. Specifically, the output should be in the format specified, with two lines per test case.

### Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
6
3 6 5
5 2 4
5 4 6
6 3 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 6 4 2 5 3 
4 2 3 1 
```

However, due to the issues mentioned above, the program will not produce this output. Instead, it will likely produce incorrect permutations for `p` and `q` or fail to produce any output at all.

### Conclusion:

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to incorrect function calls, input handling, and logic for reconstructing the polygon and cutting order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
