You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We are committed to the well being of all participants. Therefore, instead of the problem, we suggest you enjoy a piece of cake.

Uh oh. Somebody cut the cake. We told them to wait for you, but they did it anyway. There is still some left, though, if you hurry back. Of course, before you taste the cake, you thought about how the cake was cut.

It is known that the cake was originally a regular n-sided polygon, each vertex of which had a unique number from 1 to n. The vertices were numbered in random order.

Each piece of the cake is a triangle. The cake was cut into n - 2 pieces as follows: each time one cut was made with a knife (from one vertex to another) such that exactly one triangular piece was separated from the current cake, and the rest continued to be a convex polygon. In other words, each time three consecutive vertices of the polygon were selected and the corresponding triangle was cut off.

A possible process of cutting the cake is presented in the picture below.

<image> Example of 6-sided cake slicing.

You are given a set of n-2 triangular pieces in random order. The vertices of each piece are given in random order — clockwise or counterclockwise. Each piece is defined by three numbers — the numbers of the corresponding n-sided cake vertices.

For example, for the situation in the picture above, you could be given a set of pieces: [3, 6, 5], [5, 2, 4], [5, 4, 6], [6, 3, 1].

You are interested in two questions.

  * What was the enumeration of the n-sided cake vertices? 
  * In what order were the pieces cut? 



Formally, you have to find two permutations p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) and q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2} (1 ≤ q_i ≤ n - 2) such that if the cake vertices are numbered with the numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n in order clockwise or counterclockwise, then when cutting pieces of the cake in the order q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2} always cuts off a triangular piece so that the remaining part forms one convex polygon.

For example, in the picture above the answer permutations could be: p=[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5] (or any of its cyclic shifts, or its reversal and after that any cyclic shift) and q=[2, 4, 1, 3].

Write a program that, based on the given triangular pieces, finds any suitable permutations p and q.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then there are t independent sets of input data.

The first line of each set consists of a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the cake.

The following n - 2 lines describe the numbers of the pieces vertices: each line consists of three different integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n) — the numbers of the pieces vertices of cake given in random order. The pieces are given in random order.

It is guaranteed that the answer to each of the tests exists. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

Print 2t lines — answers to given t test cases in the order in which they are written in the input. Each answer should consist of 2 lines.

In the first line of an answer on a test case print n distinct numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n(1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the numbers of the cake vertices in clockwise or counterclockwise order.

In the second line of an answer on a test case print n - 2 distinct numbers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n - 2}(1 ≤ q_i ≤ n - 2) — the order of cutting pieces of the cake. The number of a piece of the cake corresponds to its number in the input.

If there are several answers, print any. It is guaranteed that the answer to each of the tests exists.

```
Output hints: The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output. Specifically, it reads the number of vertices `n` and a list of `n-2` tuples representing triangular pieces of a cake. It constructs a graph using these pieces and performs a series of operations to determine two sequences: `p` and `q`. The sequence `p` represents a traversal order of the vertices, and `q` represents additional derived values based on the triangular pieces. After processing, the function prints both sequences to standard output. The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid cases explicitly. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is less than 3, which would result in no triangular pieces being processed, and the behavior in such cases is undefined. Additionally, the function does not validate the input format or check for consistency in the triangular pieces, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is malformed.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
