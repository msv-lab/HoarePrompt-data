The code snippet provided only includes a print statement, which outputs the string 'No' to the console. This operation does not alter the state of any variables or the program's flow. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`.**
