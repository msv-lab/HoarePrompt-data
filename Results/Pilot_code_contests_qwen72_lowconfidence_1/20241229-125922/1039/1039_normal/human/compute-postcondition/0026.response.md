Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, and `pos` retains its current value. If `x` > `L`, `'No'` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `pos` retains its current value and no action is taken.***
