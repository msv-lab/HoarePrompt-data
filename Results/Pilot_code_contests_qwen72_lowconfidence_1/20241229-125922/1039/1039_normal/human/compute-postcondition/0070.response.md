The value of `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`. Given that `x` is the first element of `ar` and `x + k > L`, the calculation for `pos` results in a negative value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `x + k > L`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
