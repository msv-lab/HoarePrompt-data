The code snippet provided is a simple print statement, which does not alter the state of any variables. However, since the initial state includes conditions and variable assignments, we need to ensure that these conditions and variables remain unchanged unless specified otherwise by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is as returned by `func_2()`
- `k` is as returned by `func_2()`
- `L` is as returned by `func_2()`
- `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements
- `x` is the third element in `ar`
- `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`
- `limit` is `L - x`
- If `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The code snippet:
```python
print('No')
```

Impact of the code:
- The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console.
- No variables are modified by this statement.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables or conditions.

Output State: **`n` is as returned by `func_2()`, `k` is as returned by `func_2()`, `L` is as returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`. If `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
