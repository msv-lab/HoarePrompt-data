Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `x` is the first element of `ar`. If `x + k <= L`, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, and `pos` remaining `None`. If `x + k > L`, and `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `limit = L - x`, and if `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is assigned the value `x - L`, which is a positive value since `x > L`.***
