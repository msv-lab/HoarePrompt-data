Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `x + k > L`. If `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`), the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
