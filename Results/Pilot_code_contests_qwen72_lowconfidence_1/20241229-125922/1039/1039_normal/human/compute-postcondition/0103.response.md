The code snippet initializes the variable `pos` to `None`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, or `ar`, which were previously assigned values returned by `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `None`**
