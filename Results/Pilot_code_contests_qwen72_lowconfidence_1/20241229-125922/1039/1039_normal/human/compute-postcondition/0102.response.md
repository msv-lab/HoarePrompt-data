The code snippet assigns the value returned by `func_2()` to the variable `ar`. Since `n`, `k`, and `L` were previously assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, the output state will reflect the new assignment to `ar` while keeping the values of `n`, `k`, and `L` unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`**
