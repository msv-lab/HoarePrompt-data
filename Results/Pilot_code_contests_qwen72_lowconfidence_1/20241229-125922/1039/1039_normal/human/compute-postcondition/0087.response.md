The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

Given the initial conditions and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact:

- The code snippet only contains a print statement that outputs 'No'.
- This print statement does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `pos`, `limit`).
- Since no changes are made to any variables, the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing 'No'.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `pos` is `None` if `x + k` â‰¤ `L`, otherwise `pos` is unchanged, `limit` is undefined, 'No' is printed.**
