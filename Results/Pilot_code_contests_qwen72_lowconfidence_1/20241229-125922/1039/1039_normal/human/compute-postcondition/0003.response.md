The variable `pos` is assigned the value `None`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, or `ar`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`**
