The code snippet sets the variable `pos` to `None`. This operation overrides the previous value of `pos`, regardless of what it was before. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`) and conditions (if `x` > `L`, `'No'` is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `None`. If `x` > `L`, `'No'` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
