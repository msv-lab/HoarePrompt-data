Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()` each time the outer loop runs, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\). `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop, if any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L` or if `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`, the program prints 'No' and the loop terminates early. If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints 'Yes'. After all iterations of the outer loop, the program will have printed 'No' or 'Yes' for each set of `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar` provided by `func_2()`.**
