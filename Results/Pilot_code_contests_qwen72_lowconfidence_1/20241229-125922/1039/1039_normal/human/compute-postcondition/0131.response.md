The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. Since the `break` statement does not alter any variable values, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the program control exits the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, 'No' is printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
