The line of code `limit = L - x` assigns the value `L - x` to the variable `limit`. This impacts the state of the program by updating the value of `limit`.

- `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged from their values assigned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` remains an iterable with at least two elements.
- `x` remains the second element in `ar`.
- The condition `x > L` and the print statement 'No' are not affected by this line.
- The condition `x + k <= L` is not affected by this line.
- The condition `x + k > L` and the subsequent checks involving `pos` and `limit` are not affected by this line.
- `pos` remains either `None` or its previously assigned value.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the string 'No' is printed to the console. If `x + k` <= `L`, the current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`. If `x + k` > `L` and `pos` is not `None` and `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`), the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`**.
