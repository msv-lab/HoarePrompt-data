To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `pos` is `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in ar:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `ar` is not an empty list. The loop iterates over each element in `ar`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `ar` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
   - `x` will take the value of the first element in `ar` during the first iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `ar` is a non-empty list.
- `x` should be the first element of `ar` before the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`**
