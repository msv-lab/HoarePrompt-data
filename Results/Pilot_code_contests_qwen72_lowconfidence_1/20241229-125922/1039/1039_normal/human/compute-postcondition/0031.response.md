The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing within. Since the `break` statement does not alter the values of any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the program control will exit the loop or conditional block.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers
- `x` is the next element in `ar`
- `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`
- `limit` is `L - x`

After the `break` statement, the state remains the same, but the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
