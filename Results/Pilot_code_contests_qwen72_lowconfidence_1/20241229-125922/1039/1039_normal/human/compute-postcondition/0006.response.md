The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This operation does not alter any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing 'No'.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `L`**.
