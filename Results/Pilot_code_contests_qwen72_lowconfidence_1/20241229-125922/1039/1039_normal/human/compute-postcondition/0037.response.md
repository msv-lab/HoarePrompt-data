The code snippet `print('No')` only affects the console output and does not modify any of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `pos`, and `limit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` remains unchanged if `x + k <= L` or is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` if `x + k > L` and `pos` is not `None`, `limit` is set to `L - x` if `pos` is updated, and the loop continues unless `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
