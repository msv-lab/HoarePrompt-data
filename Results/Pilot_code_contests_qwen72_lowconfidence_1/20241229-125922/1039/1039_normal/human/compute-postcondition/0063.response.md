The code snippet assigns the value `L - x` to the variable `limit`. Since `x` is the first element of `ar` and `x + k > L`, it implies that `L - x` is a non-negative value less than `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is not `None`, `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x + k > L`, `limit` is `L - x`.**
