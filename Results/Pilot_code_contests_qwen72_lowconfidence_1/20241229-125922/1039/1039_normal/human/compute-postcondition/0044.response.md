The `break` statement causes the termination of the loop it is within, without altering the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop is exited.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, x - L)`, `limit` is `L - x`, the loop has been exited.**
