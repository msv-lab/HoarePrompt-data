Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`. If `x > L`, 'No' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `pos` unchanged. If `x ≤ L` and `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`. If `pos` > `limit`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x ≤ L` and `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `x - L`.***
