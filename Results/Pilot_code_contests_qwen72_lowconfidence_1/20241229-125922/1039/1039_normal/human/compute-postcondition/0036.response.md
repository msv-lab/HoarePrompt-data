To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ar`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers.
   - `x` is the next element in `ar`.
   - If `x + k <= L`, `pos` remains unchanged, and no action is taken.
   - If `x + k > L`, and `pos` is `None`, `'No'` is printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, and `limit` is set to `L - x`.
   - If the updated `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are constants determined by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `x` is the current element in `ar`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will move to the next element in `ar`.
   - Therefore, `x` will be the next element in the list.

3. **Conditions and State Updates**:
   - If `x + k <= L`, `pos` remains unchanged.
   - If `x + k > L`:
     - If `pos` is `None`, the loop breaks.
     - If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, and `limit` is set to `L - x`.
     - If the updated `pos` is greater than `limit`, the loop breaks.

### Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:

- **`x`**: The next element in `ar`.
- **`pos`**: Remains unchanged if `x + k <= L`. If `x + k > L` and `pos` is not `None`, it is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.
- **`limit`**: Set to `L - x` if `pos` is updated.
- **`ar`**: The list remains the same, but the next element is considered.
- **`n`, `k`, `L`**: These values remain constant as they are returned by `func_2()`.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:

State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` remains unchanged if `x + k <= L` or is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` if `x + k > L` and `pos` is not `None`, `limit` is set to `L - x` if `pos` is updated, and the loop continues unless `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
