To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop.

### Given:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `pos` is `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in ar:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `ar`.
- For the loop to execute, `ar` must contain at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **List `ar`**: The loop will only execute if `ar` is not empty. Therefore, `ar` must have at least one element.
2. **Initial Value of `x`**: Before the loop starts, `x` will be set to the first element of `ar`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ar` must be a non-empty list.
- `x` will be the first element of `ar`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `None`**
