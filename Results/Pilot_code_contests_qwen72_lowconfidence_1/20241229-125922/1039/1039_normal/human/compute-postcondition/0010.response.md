The code snippet assigns `None` to the variable `pos`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, or `x`. Since `pos` was already `None` in the initial state, the assignment does not alter its value.

Therefore, the Output State remains:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\)
- `pos` is `None`
- `x` is the first element of `ar`
- The current value of `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, the current value of `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`**
