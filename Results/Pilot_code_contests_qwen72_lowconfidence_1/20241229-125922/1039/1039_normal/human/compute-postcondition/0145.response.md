Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are as returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`. If `pos` > `limit`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
