The code snippet `print('No')` only prints the string 'No' to the console and does not alter any of the variables in the current state. Since no variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, x - L)`, `limit` is `L - x`, the loop continues unless `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
