Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, and `x` is the second element in `ar`. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`. If the updated `pos` is greater than `L - x`, 'No' is printed to the console, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `pos`. If `pos` is initially `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.***
