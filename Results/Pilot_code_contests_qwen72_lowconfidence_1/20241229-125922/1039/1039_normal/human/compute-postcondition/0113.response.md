`limit` is assigned the value of `L - x`. Given the initial conditions, `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged. `ar` is still an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is not `None`, and `x` is still the first element in `ar`. The condition `x + k > L` remains true. Since `x > L` causes the most internal loop or if statement to exit, this condition also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is not `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `x + k > L`.**
