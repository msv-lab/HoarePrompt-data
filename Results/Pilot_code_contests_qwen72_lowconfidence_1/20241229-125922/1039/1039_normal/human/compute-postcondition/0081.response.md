Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `x` â‰¤ `L`, `limit` = `L` - `x`, `pos` = max(`pos` + 1, -(`L` - `x`)) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
