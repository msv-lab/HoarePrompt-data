`pos` is updated to the maximum value between `pos + 1` and `-(L - x)`. Since `x > L` and `x + k > L`, `-(L - x)` is a positive number, and since `pos` is not `None`, `pos + 1` is also a valid value. Given that `x > L`, `-(L - x)` is greater than `pos + 1`, so `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `limit`, and the fact that 'No' has been printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x + k > L`, `limit` is `L - x`.**
