The code snippet updates the value of `pos` using the expression `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `pos` is not `None`.
   - `x` is the first element of `ar`.
   - `L - x` is assigned to `limit`.
   - `x + k > L` implies `L - x < k`, so `limit < k`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `pos + 1`: This increments the current value of `pos` by 1.
   - `-(L - x)`: This is the negation of `L - x`, which is equivalent to `-limit`.

3. **Comparison**:
   - We need to determine which of `pos + 1` or `-(L - x)` is greater.
   - Since `L - x` is a positive value (as `x` is the first element of `ar` and `0 <= d_i <= 10^9`), `-(L - x)` is a negative value.
   - Therefore, `pos + 1` (which is a positive or zero value) will always be greater than `-(L - x)`.

4. **Result**:
   - `pos` will be updated to `pos + 1`.

Thus, the updated state of the variables is:

- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `pos` is now `pos + 1`.
- `x` is the first element of `ar`.
- `x + k > L`.
- `limit = L - x`.
- `limit < k`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `pos + 1`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `x + k > L`, `limit = L - x`, and `limit < k`.**
