The value of `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`, which simplifies to `x - L`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`) remain unchanged. Since the condition `x > L` would cause the program to print 'No' and break out of the most internal loop or if statement, this scenario assumes `x ≤ L`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `x` ≤ `L`, `pos` is `x - L`.
