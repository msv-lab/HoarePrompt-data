To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is `None`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in ar:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `ar`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `ar` must be an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, set, etc.) and must contain at least one element.

### States to Adjust:
- `ar` must be an iterable with at least one element.
- The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `ar` during the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `ar` is an iterable with at least one element. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, and `pos`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they should still be part of the state description.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`**
