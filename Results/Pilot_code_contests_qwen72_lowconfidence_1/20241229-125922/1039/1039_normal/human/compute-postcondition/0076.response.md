Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' will be printed, and the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `pos` unchanged. If `x` â‰¤ `L`, the state remains unchanged.***
