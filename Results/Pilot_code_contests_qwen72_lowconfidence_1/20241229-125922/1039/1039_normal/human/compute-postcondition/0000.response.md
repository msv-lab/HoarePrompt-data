Output State: **The program returns a nested list of calls to `f()` with the structure defined by `*dim`. If `dim` is empty, the program returns the result of calling `f()`. Each level of the nested list corresponds to one dimension in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`.**
