Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `pos + 1`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `x + k > L`, `limit = L - x`, and `limit < k`. If `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
