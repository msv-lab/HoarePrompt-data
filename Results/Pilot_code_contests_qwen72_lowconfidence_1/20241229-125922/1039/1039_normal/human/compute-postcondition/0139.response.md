Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, and `pos` retains its value from the previous iteration (or is updated if the loop body modifies it). If `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
