Output State: **`n` is as returned by `func_2()`, `k` is as returned by `func_2()`, `L` is as returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
