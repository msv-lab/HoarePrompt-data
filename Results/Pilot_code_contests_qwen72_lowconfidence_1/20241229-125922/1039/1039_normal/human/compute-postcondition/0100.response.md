To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
   - If `ar` is empty, 'Yes' is printed.
   - If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L`, 'No' is printed.
   - If all elements `x` in `ar` are less than or equal to `L`:
     - If any `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`, `pos` is `None`.
     - If all `x` satisfy `x + k > L`, `pos` is updated according to the rules within the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, 'Yes' is printed.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input.
   - The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, so it does not affect the state.
   - The loop will execute again if there are more iterations left based on the user input.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The number of remaining iterations is determined by the user input.
   - The state variables `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar` are not directly affected by the loop counter `_`.
   - The only state that changes is the implicit count of how many times the loop has run.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the same values for `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar`, but the loop counter should be incremented by 1. However, since the loop counter is not explicitly stored in a variable, we only need to ensure that the loop condition (number of iterations) is still valid.

**State:**
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), and the loop can execute one more time if the user input allows it.**
