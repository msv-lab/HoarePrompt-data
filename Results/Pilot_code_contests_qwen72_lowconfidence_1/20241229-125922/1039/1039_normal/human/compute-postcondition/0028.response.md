The value of `limit` is set to `L - x`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `pos`) retain their current values. Since the condition for printing `'No'` and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not triggered by this assignment, the program continues with the updated state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` retains its current value, `limit` is `L - x`.**
