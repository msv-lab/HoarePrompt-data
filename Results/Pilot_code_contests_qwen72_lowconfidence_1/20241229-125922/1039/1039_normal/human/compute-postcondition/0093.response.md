The code snippet `print('No')` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It only outputs the string 'No' to the console.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.**
