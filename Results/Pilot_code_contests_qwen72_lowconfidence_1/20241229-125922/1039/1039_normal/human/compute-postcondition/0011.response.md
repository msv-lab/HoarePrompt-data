Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`. If `x` > `L`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `x + k > L`***
