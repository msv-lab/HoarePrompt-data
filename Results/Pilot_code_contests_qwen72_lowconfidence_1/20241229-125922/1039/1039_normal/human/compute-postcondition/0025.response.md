The `break` statement causes the program to exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the context, we assume this `break` is within a loop or conditional structure that is part of the broader program flow not shown here.

- The variables `n`, `k`, `L` retain their values as returned by `func_2()`.
- The list `ar` remains a non-empty list of `n` integers.
- The variable `x` continues to represent the next element in `ar`.
- The variable `pos` retains its current value, which may have been updated based on conditions inside the loop body prior to the `break`.
- The string `'No'` has been printed, but this does not affect the state of any variables.

Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` retains its current value, and `'No'` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
