The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. Since no changes are made to any variables by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `L`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
