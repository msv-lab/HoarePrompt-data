The code snippet assigns the value `L - x` to the variable `limit`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n`, `k`, and `L` are values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `pos` is not `None`.
- `x` is the first element of `ar`.
- If `x` > `L`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `x + k > L`.

The value of `limit` is calculated as `L - x`. Since `x + k > L`, it follows that `L - x < k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is not `None`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `x + k > L`, `limit = L - x`, and `limit < k`.**
