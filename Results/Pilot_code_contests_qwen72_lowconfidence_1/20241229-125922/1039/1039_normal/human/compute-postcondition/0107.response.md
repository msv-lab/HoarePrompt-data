The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently executing. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `L`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
