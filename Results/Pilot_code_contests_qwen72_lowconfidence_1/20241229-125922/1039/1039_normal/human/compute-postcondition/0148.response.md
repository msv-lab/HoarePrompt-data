Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, and `x` is the third element in `ar`. If `x + k <= L`, `pos` is set to `None`. If `x + k > L`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` if `pos` is not `None`, or `pos` is set to `-(L - x)` if `pos` is `None`. If `pos` > `limit` (where `limit` is `L - x`), or if `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
