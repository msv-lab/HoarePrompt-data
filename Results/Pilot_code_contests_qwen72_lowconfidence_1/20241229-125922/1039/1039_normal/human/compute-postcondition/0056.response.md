The code snippet provided contains only a print statement, which outputs the string 'No'. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the string 'No' has been printed.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `None`, the current value of `x` is greater than `L`, and 'No' has been printed.**
