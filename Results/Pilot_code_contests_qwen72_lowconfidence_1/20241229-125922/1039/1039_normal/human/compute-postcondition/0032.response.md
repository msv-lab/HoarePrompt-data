Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`. If `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.***
