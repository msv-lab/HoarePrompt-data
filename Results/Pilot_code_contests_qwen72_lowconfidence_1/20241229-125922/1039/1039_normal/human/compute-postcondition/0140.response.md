The code assigns `None` to the variable `pos`. This changes the value of `pos` from whatever it was previously (either retained from the previous iteration or set within the loop) to `None`.

- `n`, `k`, and `L` retain their values as returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` remains an iterable with at least three elements.
- `x` remains the third element in `ar`.
- The condition `x > L` and the potential breaking out of the loop or if statement are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` is `None`, and if `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
