The code snippet `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. This operation does not alter any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and `x + k > L`. Additionally, `pos` is `-(L - x)` and the current value of `pos` is greater than `limit`.**
