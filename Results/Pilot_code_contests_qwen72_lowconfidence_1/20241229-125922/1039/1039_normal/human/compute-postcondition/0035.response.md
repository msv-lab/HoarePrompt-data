Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, and `x` is the next element in `ar`. If `x + k <= L`, `pos` remains unchanged, and no action is taken. If `x + k > L`, and `pos` is `None`, `'No'` is printed, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, and `limit` is set to `L - x`. If the updated `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.***
