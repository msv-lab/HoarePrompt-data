The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `f`, which is a callable function, and `*dim`, a tuple of non-negative integers representing the dimensions of the nested list to be created. If `*dim` is empty, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. If `*dim` is not empty, the function returns a nested list where each level of nesting corresponds to one dimension specified in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`. Each element in the nested list is the result of calling `f()`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a callable `f` and a tuple of non-negative integers `*dim`. If `*dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a nested list with the structure defined by `*dim`, where each element is the result of calling `f()`.**
