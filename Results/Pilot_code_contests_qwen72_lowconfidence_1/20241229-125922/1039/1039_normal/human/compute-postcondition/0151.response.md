The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `L` is an integer such that 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `d_i` satisfies 0 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs. However, the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Assuming the function processes these inputs to produce a single output, the general description of the function's functionality would be:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `L`, and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, and the elements of `ar`.**
