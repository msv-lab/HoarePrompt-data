To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the initial conditions. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `pos` is `None`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in ar:
    if x > L:
        print('No')
        break
    if x + k <= L:
        pos = None
    elif pos is not None:
        limit = L - x
        pos = max(pos + 1, -(L - x))
        if pos > limit:
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        pos = -(L - x)
else:
    print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `ar`.
   - The loop will execute at least once if `ar` is not empty.

2. **Behavior Inside the Loop**:
   - If `x > L`, the loop prints 'No' and breaks immediately.
   - If `x + k <= L`, `pos` is set to `None`.
   - If `x + k > L` and `pos` is not `None`:
     - `limit` is set to `L - x`.
     - `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.
     - If `pos > limit`, the loop prints 'No' and breaks.
   - If `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L`, the loop will print 'No' and terminate.
   - If all elements `x` in `ar` satisfy `x <= L`:
     - If any `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`, `pos` will be set to `None`.
     - If all `x` satisfy `x + k > L`, `pos` will be updated according to the rules within the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'Yes'.

### Output State:
- If `ar` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the program prints 'Yes'.
- If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L`, the loop prints 'No' and terminates.
- If all elements `x` in `ar` are less than or equal to `L`:
  - If any `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`, `pos` will be `None`.
  - If all `x` satisfy `x + k > L`, `pos` will be updated according to the rules within the loop.
- If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'Yes'.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\). If `ar` is empty, 'Yes' is printed. If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L`, 'No' is printed. If all elements `x` in `ar` are less than or equal to `L`:
- If any `x` satisfies `x + k <= L`, `pos` is `None`.
- If all `x` satisfy `x + k > L`, `pos` is updated according to the rules within the loop.
If the loop completes without breaking, 'Yes' is printed.**
