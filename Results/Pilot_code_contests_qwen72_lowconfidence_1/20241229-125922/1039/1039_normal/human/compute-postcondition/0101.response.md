The code snippet `n, k, L = func_2()` assigns the return values of the function `func_2` to the variables `n`, `k`, and `L`. Since the specific values returned by `func_2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `L`. However, we know that these variables will hold the values returned by `func_2`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`**
