The code snippet sets the value of `limit` to `L - x`. This impacts the `limit` variable but does not change any other variables mentioned in the initial state. The conditions for updating `pos` and breaking the loop remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` remains unchanged, `limit` is `L - x`, the loop continues unless `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
