Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, x - L)`, `limit` is set to `L - x`, and the loop exits if `pos` is greater than `limit`. Otherwise, the loop continues unless `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`, `limit` is set to `L - x`, and the loop exits if `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.***
