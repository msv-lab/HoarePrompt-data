Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, and `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, where `x` is the second element in `ar`. If `x + k` <= `L`, the current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`, and `pos` remains `None`. If `x + k` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the string 'No' is printed to the console if `x` > `L` or if `pos` is not `None` and `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`). If `pos` is initially `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, and if the updated `pos` is greater than `L - x`, 'No' is printed to the console and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `pos`.***
