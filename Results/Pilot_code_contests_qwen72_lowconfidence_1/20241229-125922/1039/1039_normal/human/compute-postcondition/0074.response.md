The provided code snippet only contains a print statement `print('No')`. This means the program will print 'No' and no further operations are specified to alter the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' will be printed, and the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x + k <= L`, the state remains unchanged. If `x + k > L`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`. If `pos` is not `None` and `pos` > `L - x`, the program state remains as described above. However, since the only action taken is printing 'No', the state of the variables does not change.
