The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `ar`. Since the initial state specifies that `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), and this list is obtained from the function `func_2()`, the assignment updates `ar` to this list.

The values of `n`, `k`, and `L` are also mentioned to be returned by `func_2()`, but since they are not explicitly reassigned in the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The variable `pos` is also not modified by the code snippet, so its value remains either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop.**
