The code snippet provided assigns the value of `L - x` to the variable `limit`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n`, `k`, `L` are values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers, where each element \(d_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), and `ar` must have at least one element.
- `x` is the second element of `ar`.
- If `x` > `L`, 'No' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `pos` unchanged.
- If `x` ≤ `L`, the state remains unchanged.

Given the condition that if `x` > `L`, the program prints 'No' and breaks out, this part of the condition is not met because the code snippet does not include the print or break statements. Therefore, we assume `x` ≤ `L`.

The code snippet `limit = L - x` will execute, and `limit` will be assigned the value of `L - x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `x` ≤ `L`, `limit` = `L` - `x`**.
