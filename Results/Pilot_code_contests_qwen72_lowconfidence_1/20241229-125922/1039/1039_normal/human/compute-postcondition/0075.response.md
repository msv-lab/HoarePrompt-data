The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate enclosing loop or if statement. Since no changes to variables are made within this snippet, the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `pos` remain unchanged. However, the program flow is altered.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `pos` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
