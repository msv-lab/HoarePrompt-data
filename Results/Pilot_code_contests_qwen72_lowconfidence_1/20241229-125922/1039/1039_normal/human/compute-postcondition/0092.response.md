Initial State: `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `pos` is unchanged, `limit` is `L - x`.

Code Snippet:
```
pos = max(pos + 1, -(L - x))
```

Step-by-step Impact:
1. `pos + 1` is calculated.
2. `-(L - x)` is calculated.
3. `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` is computed, and the result is assigned to `pos`.

Let's break it down:
- `pos` is updated to the maximum value between `pos + 1` and `-(L - x)`.
- `L - x` is already known from the previous state, so `-(L - x)` is simply `-limit`.

Thus, `pos` is updated to the maximum of `pos + 1` and `-limit`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`**.
