Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `L`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. For each set of inputs, the function checks if it is possible to place a sequence of numbers (from the list `ar`) in a way that no two adjacent numbers exceed a certain limit defined by `L` and `k`. Specifically, the function ensures that no number in `ar` exceeds `L`, and for any two consecutive numbers `x` and `y` in the sequence, the condition `x + k <= y` holds true. If the sequence can be arranged according to these rules, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function continues processing until all sets of inputs have been evaluated. After execution, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each set of inputs, reflecting whether the conditions were met for each case. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Empty List**: If `ar` is empty, the function will print 'Yes' since there are no elements to violate the conditions.
- **Single Element List**: If `ar` contains only one element, the function will print 'Yes' if the element is less than or equal to `L`, and 'No' otherwise.
- **All Elements Equal**: If all elements in `ar` are equal and less than or equal to `L`, the function will print 'Yes'.
- **Elements Exceeding `L`**: If any element in `ar` is greater than `L`, the function will print 'No' and terminate early for that set of inputs.
- **Consecutive Elements Violating Condition**: If there are consecutive elements in `ar` such that `x + k > y` for any `x` and `y`, the function will print 'No' and terminate early for that set of inputs.
- **Initial Position Handling**: The initial position `pos` is set to `None`, and it is updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `pos` is not properly managed, it could lead to incorrect results in edge cases. However, the current logic appears to handle this correctly.
