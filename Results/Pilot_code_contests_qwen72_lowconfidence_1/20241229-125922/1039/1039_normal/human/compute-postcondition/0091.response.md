The code snippet provided only contains the line `limit = L - x`. This line calculates the difference between `L` and `x` and assigns this value to `limit`. The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, and `pos` remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the impact:

- `limit` is now `L - x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `pos`) retain their initial values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `pos` is unchanged, `limit` is `L - x`**.
