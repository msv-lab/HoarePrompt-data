The code snippet provided only includes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This does not alter the values of any variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `x` â‰¤ `L`, `limit` = `L` - `x`, `pos` = max(`pos` + 1, -(`L` - `x`))**
