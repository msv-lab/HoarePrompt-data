To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element.
   - `x` is the first element of `ar`.
   - If `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `x + k <= L`, the state remains unchanged.
   - If `x + k > L`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.
   - If `pos` is not `None` and `pos` > `L - x`, the program state remains as described above.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for x in ar:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `ar`.
   - After the previous iteration, `x` was the first element of `ar`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the second element of `ar`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `x` should now be the second element of `ar`.
   - The conditions and logic within the loop body will be applied to this new value of `x`.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n`, `k`, `L` remain unchanged.
   - `ar` remains the same list.
   - `x` is now the second element of `ar`.
   - The conditions for `x` and `pos` will be re-evaluated based on the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' will be printed, and the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x + k <= L`, the state remains unchanged. If `x + k > L`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`. If `pos` is not `None` and `pos` > `L - x`, the program state remains as described above.**
