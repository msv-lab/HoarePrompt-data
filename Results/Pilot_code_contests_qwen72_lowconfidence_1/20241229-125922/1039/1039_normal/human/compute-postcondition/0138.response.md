The `break` statement causes the termination of the loop or the conditional block where it is located. However, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` retains its value from the previous iteration (or is updated if the loop body modifies it), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
