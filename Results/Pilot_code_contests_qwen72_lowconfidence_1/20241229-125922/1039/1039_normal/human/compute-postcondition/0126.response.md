Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ar`. If `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the string 'No' is printed to the console. If `x + k` <= `L`, the current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`. If `x + k` > `L` and `pos` is not `None` and `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`), the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.***
