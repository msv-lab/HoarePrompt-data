The given Python code snippet is:

```python
pos = -(L - x)
```

Given the Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements.
- `x` is the third element of `ar`.
- If `x > L`, 'No' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `pos` unchanged.
- If `x ≤ L`, `pos` is either `None` if `x + k` ≤ `L`, or updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` if `pos` is not `None`, and if `pos` > `limit`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `x ≤ L` and `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `x - L`.

The code snippet `pos = -(L - x)` updates the value of `pos` to `-(L - x)`. This means `pos` will now hold the value of `x - L`.

Since the initial state already specifies that `x` is the third element of `ar` and `L` is a value returned by `func_2()`, the only variable being updated here is `pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `pos` is `x - L`.**
