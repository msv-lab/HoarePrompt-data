Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` and `limit` is set to `L - x`. If `pos` > `limit`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking out of the loop or if statement. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`, and if `x` > `L`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
