Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, and `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`. If `pos` is greater than `limit`, 'No' is printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated value of `pos`. If `pos` was initially `None`, it is set to `-(L - x)`.***
