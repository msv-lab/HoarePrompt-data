Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`. The current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`. If `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
