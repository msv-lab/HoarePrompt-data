The code snippet `pos = -(L - x)` modifies the value of `pos`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`. These values remain unchanged.
- `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, which remains unchanged.
- `pos` was initially `None`. After executing the code, `pos` is now `-(L - x)`.
- `x` is the first element in `ar`, and its value remains unchanged.
- The condition `x + k > L` remains true and is unaffected by the code execution.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `x` is the first element in `ar`, and `x + k > L`.**
