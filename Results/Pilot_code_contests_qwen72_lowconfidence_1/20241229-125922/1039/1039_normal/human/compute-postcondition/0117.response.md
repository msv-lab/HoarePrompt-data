The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but the flow of control does. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `x` is the first element in `ar`, `limit` is `L - x`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `x + k > L`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, and the current value of `pos` is greater than `limit`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
