The values of `n`, `k`, and `L` are updated based on the return values from the function `func_2()`. The variables `ar` and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop.
