The code snippet sets the variable `pos` to `None`. This impacts the conditions involving `pos` in the subsequent logic, but does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, or `limit`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `None`, `limit` is set to `L - x` if `pos` is updated, and the loop is broken if `x > L` or `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`.**
