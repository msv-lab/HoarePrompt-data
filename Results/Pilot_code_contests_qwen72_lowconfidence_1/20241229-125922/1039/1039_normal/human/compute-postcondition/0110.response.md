The code snippet provided only reassigns the value of `pos` to `None`. Since `pos` was already `None` in the initial state, there is no change to the value of `pos`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The condition that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L` still holds, and the condition for exiting the loop or if statement remains unmet.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`. The current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`. If `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
