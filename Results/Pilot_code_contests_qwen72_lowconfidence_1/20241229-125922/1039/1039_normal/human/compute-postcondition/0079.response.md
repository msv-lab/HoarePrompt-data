The code snippet provided updates the value of `pos` using the expression `pos = max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element.
   - `x` is the second element of `ar`.
   - `x` ≤ `L`.
   - `limit` = `L` - `x`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `pos = max(pos + 1, -(L - x))` is evaluated.
   - `pos + 1` is calculated.
   - `-(L - x)` is calculated, which simplifies to `-limit`.
   - `max(pos + 1, -limit)` is computed, and the result is assigned to `pos`.

3. **Impact**:
   - The value of `pos` is updated to the maximum of `pos + 1` and `-limit`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element.
   - `x` is the second element of `ar`.
   - `x` ≤ `L`.
   - `limit` = `L` - `x`.
   - `pos` = max(`pos` + 1, -(`L` - `x`)).

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `x` ≤ `L`, `limit` = `L` - `x`, `pos` = max(`pos` + 1, -(`L` - `x`))**.
