The value of `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is the next element in `ar`, and `pos` now holds the value of `-(L - x)`. The condition `if x > L` leading to printing `'No'` and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not part of the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the current state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`**
