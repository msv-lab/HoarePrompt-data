To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop structure:

### Given:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- `x` is the first element of `ar`.
- If `x + k <= L`, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, and `pos` remaining `None`.
- If `x + k > L` and `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `limit = L - x`, and if `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is assigned the value `x - L`, which is a positive value since `x > L`.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for x in ar:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers.
   - `x` is the first element of `ar`.
   - `pos` is either `None` or a positive integer.

2. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `ar`.
   - The value of `x` will be the next element in `ar` during the next iteration.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.
   - The value of `pos` may change based on the conditions inside the loop body.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The value of `x` should be updated to the next element in `ar`.
   - The value of `pos` may change based on the conditions inside the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `x` is the next element in `ar`.
- `pos` may change based on the conditions inside the loop body.
- `n`, `k`, and `L` remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` may be updated based on the conditions inside the loop body.**
