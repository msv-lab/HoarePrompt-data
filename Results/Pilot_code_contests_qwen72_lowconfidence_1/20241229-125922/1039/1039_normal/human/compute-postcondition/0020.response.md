`pos` is assigned the value `-(L - x)`, which simplifies to `x - L`. The value of `x` is the first element of `ar`, and it is given that `x + k > L`. This implies that `x > L - k`. Since `x` is also greater than `L`, `x - L` is a positive value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `x - L`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `x` > `L`, `x + k > L`**.
