Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `pos` unchanged. If `x` ≤ `L` and `pos` is not None, `limit` is set to `L` - `x`, `pos` is updated to max(`pos` + 1, -(`L` - `x`)), and if `pos` > `limit`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` ≤ `L` and `pos` is None, `pos` is set to `x - L`.***
