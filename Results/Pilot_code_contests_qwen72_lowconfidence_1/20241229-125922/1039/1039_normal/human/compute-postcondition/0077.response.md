The provided code snippet initializes the variable `pos` to `None`. This action does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state, such as `n`, `k`, `L`, or `ar`. The condition involving `x` and `L` is not evaluated in this snippet, so no changes occur to the state based on the comparison between `x` and `L`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the second element of `ar`, `pos` is `None`.**
