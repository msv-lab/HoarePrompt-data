The code prints 'No' and does not alter any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is `pos + 1`, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `x + k > L`, `limit = L - x`, `limit < k`, and the current value of `pos` is greater than `limit`.**
