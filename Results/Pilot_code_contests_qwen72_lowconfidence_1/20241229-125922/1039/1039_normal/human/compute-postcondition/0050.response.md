To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the given state and the loop structure. The loop is iterating over a range determined by user input, and each iteration involves processing some values and potentially terminating early based on certain conditions.

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\).
- If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L` or if `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`, the program prints 'No' and the loop terminates early.
- If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints 'Yes'.
- After the loop, `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop.

The loop structure is:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
1. The loop counter `_` must still be within the range specified by `int(input())`.
2. The conditions inside the loop (related to `ar`, `k`, `L`, and `pos`) must not cause an early termination.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we focus on the conditions that could cause early termination. These conditions are:
- Any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L`.
- Any element `x` in `ar` plus `k` is greater than `L` and `pos` is `None`.

If these conditions are not met, the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the next iteration:
- The values `n`, `k`, and `L` remain the same as they are returned by `func_2()` and are not modified within the loop.
- The list `ar` remains the same.
- The variable `pos` may change based on the conditions inside the loop, but it is not specified how it changes, so we assume it can be `None` or the last computed value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\), `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop**.
