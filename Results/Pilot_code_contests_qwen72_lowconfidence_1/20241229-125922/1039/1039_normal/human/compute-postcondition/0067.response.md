The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional structure. Since the code snippet only contains the `break` statement, no changes are made to any of the variables. The state of the program remains the same except for the control flow.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x + k > L`, `limit` is `L - x`, and `pos` is greater than `limit`.**
