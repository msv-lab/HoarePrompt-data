The code snippet updates the value of `pos` using the `max` function, which compares `pos + 1` with `-(L - x)` and assigns the larger of the two values to `pos`. Let's break down the impact:

- `pos` is updated to the maximum of `pos + 1` and `-(L - x)`.
- `pos + 1` represents incrementing the current position by 1.
- `-(L - x)` simplifies to `x - L`.

Therefore, the new value of `pos` is the maximum of `pos + 1` and `x - L`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `limit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, x - L)`, `limit` is `L - x`, the loop continues unless `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
