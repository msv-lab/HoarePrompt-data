The code snippet `pos = -(L - x)` updates the value of `pos` to `-(L - x)`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `pos` is updated to `-(L - x)`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `limit` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `limit` is set to `L - x` if `pos` is updated, and the loop is broken if `pos` is greater than `limit` or `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.**
