The code snippet provided only contains a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This operation does not modify any variables or affect the state of the program beyond printing the message. Therefore, all variables retain their values from the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `ar`, `pos` retains its value from the previous iteration (or is updated if the loop body modifies it).**
