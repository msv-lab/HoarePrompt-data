Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, x - L)`, `limit` is `L - x`. If `pos` is greater than `limit`, the loop has been exited. Otherwise, the loop continues unless `pos` is `None` and `x + k > L`.***
