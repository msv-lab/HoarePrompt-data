The provided code snippet only contains a print statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This does not alter the state of any variables. However, since the initial state mentions that `'No'` has already been printed, the execution of this code snippet will not have any additional effect on the state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `-(L - x)`, `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `x + k > L`, `limit` is `L - x`. Additionally, `pos` is greater than `limit`.**
