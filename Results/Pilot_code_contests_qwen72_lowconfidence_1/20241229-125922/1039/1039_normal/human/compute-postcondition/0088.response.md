Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `ar`, `pos` is `None` if `x + k` â‰¤ `L`, otherwise `pos` is unchanged, `limit` is undefined, 'No' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
