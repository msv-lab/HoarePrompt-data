The code updates the value of `pos` to be the maximum of `pos + 1` and `-(L - x)`. Let's break down the impact:

1. `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.
2. The value of `pos` depends on the current values of `pos`, `L`, and `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers.
- `x` is the next element in `ar`.
- `pos` retains its current value.
- `limit` is `L - x`.

After executing the code:
- `pos` is now `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, `limit`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` is `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, `limit` is `L - x`.**
