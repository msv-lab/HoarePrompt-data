The code snippet `print('No')` executes a print statement, which outputs 'No' to the console. This does not alter any of the variables or their values.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least one element, `pos` is `None`, `x` is the first element in `ar`, and the current value of `x` is greater than `L`.**
