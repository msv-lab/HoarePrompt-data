The provided Python code snippet only contains a print statement. This statement does not alter any variables or control flow; it simply outputs the string 'No' to the console.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only effect of the code is that the string 'No' is printed.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`, `pos` may be updated based on the conditions inside the loop body, and 'No' is printed.**
