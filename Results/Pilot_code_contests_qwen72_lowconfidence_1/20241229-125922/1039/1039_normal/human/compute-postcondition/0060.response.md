The line of code `pos = None` assigns the value `None` to the variable `pos`. Since `pos` was already `None` according to the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The values of `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition `x + k <= L` and the fact that if `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\) and `ar` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `ar`, `pos` is `None`. If `x` > `L`, 'No' has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `x` is such that `x + k <= L`.**
