Output State: **`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\). If any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L` or if `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`, the program prints 'No' and the loop terminates early. If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints 'Yes'. After the loop, `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop.**
