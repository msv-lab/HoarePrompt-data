Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `x` is the next element in `ar`. If `pos` is not `None`, `pos` is updated to `max(pos + 1, -(L - x))`, and `limit` is `L - x`. If the updated `pos` is greater than `limit`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally. If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.***
