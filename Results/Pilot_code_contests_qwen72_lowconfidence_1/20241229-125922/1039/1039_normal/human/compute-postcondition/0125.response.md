The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the most internal loop or if statement that contains it. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `L`, `ar`, `x`, and `pos` remain unchanged by the `break` statement itself. However, the conditions leading up to the `break` statement are important to consider for the context:

- `n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
- `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements.
- `x` is the second element in `ar`.
- If `x + k` <= `L`, the current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`.
- If `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
- If `x + k` > `L`, and `pos` is not `None`, and `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`), the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
- If `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`.
- If `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
- The string 'No' is printed to the console.

Given these conditions, the `break` statement exits the loop or if statement, and the state remains as described before the `break` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `L` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`, `ar` is an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the second element in `ar`, if `x + k` <= `L`, the current value of `x` is such that `x + k` is less than or equal to `L`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, if `x + k` > `L` and `pos` is not `None` and `pos` (which is `-(L - x)`) is greater than `limit` (which is `L - x`), the most internal loop or if statement is exited, if `pos` is `None`, `pos` is set to `-(L - x)`, if `x` > `L`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
