The function `func_5` accepts a callable `f` and a variable number of non-negative integer arguments `*dim`. If `*dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a nested list where each level of the list corresponds to one dimension specified in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`. Each element in the nested list is the result of calling `f()`. Edge cases include scenarios where `*dim` contains zero values, resulting in empty sublists at those levels, and the case where `f` returns a mutable object, which could lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.
