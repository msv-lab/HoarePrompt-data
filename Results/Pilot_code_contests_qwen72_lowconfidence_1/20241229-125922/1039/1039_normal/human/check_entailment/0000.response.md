Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem description in every potential case. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
3 2 4
2 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
No
```

Actual Output:
```
Yes
```

**Why it Fails:**
- The program checks if each depth `d_i` plus the maximum tide `k` is less than or equal to `L`. However, it does not correctly account for the dynamic nature of the tide, which alternates between increasing and decreasing.
- Specifically, the program does not check if the depth at each meter `d_i` plus the tide at the exact time `t` when Koa is at that position exceeds `L`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the tide and check if Koa can swim through each meter without exceeding the depth limit `L` at any point in time. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.
