You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The only difference between easy and hard versions is on constraints. In this version constraints are higher. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Koa the Koala is at the beach!

The beach consists (from left to right) of a shore, n+1 meters of sea and an island at n+1 meters from the shore.

She measured the depth of the sea at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore and saved them in array d. d_i denotes the depth of the sea at i meters from the shore for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Like any beach this one has tide, the intensity of the tide is measured by parameter k and affects all depths from the beginning at time t=0 in the following way:

  * For a total of k seconds, each second, tide increases all depths by 1.

  * Then, for a total of k seconds, each second, tide decreases all depths by 1.

  * This process repeats again and again (ie. depths increase for k seconds then decrease for k seconds and so on ...).

Formally, let's define 0-indexed array p = [0, 1, 2, …, k - 2, k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, …, 2, 1] of length 2k. At time t (0 ≤ t) depth at i meters from the shore equals d_i + p[t mod 2k] (t mod 2k denotes the remainder of the division of t by 2k). Note that the changes occur instantaneously after each second, see the notes for better understanding. 




At time t=0 Koa is standing at the shore and wants to get to the island. Suppose that at some time t (0 ≤ t) she is at x (0 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore:

  * In one second Koa can swim 1 meter further from the shore (x changes to x+1) or not swim at all (x stays the same), in both cases t changes to t+1.

  * As Koa is a bad swimmer, the depth of the sea at the point where she is can't exceed l at integer points of time (or she will drown). More formally, if Koa is at x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) meters from the shore at the moment t (for some integer t≥ 0), the depth of the sea at this point — d_x + p[t mod 2k] — can't exceed l. In other words, d_x + p[t mod 2k] ≤ l must hold always.

  * Once Koa reaches the island at n+1 meters from the shore, she stops and can rest.

Note that while Koa swims tide doesn't have effect on her (ie. she can't drown while swimming). Note that Koa can choose to stay on the shore for as long as she needs and neither the shore or the island are affected by the tide (they are solid ground and she won't drown there). 




Koa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her!

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k and l (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9) — the number of meters of sea Koa measured and parameters k and l.

The second line of each test case contains n integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n (0 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9) — the depths of each meter of sea Koa measured.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case:

Print Yes if Koa can get from the shore to the island, and No otherwise.

You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

2 1 1
1 0

4 4 3 0 2 4 2
5 2 3
1 2 3 2 2


Output


Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Yes
No
No

Note

In the following s denotes the shore, i denotes the island, x denotes distance from Koa to the shore, the underline denotes the position of Koa, and values in the array below denote current depths, affected by tide, at 1, 2, ..., n meters from the shore.

In test case 1 we have n = 2, k = 1, l = 1, p = [ 0, 1 ].

Koa wants to go from shore (at x = 0) to the island (at x = 3). Let's describe a possible solution:

  * Initially at t = 0 the beach looks like this: [\underline{s}, 1, 0, i]. 
  * At t = 0 if Koa would decide to swim to x = 1, beach would look like: [s, \underline{2}, 1, i] at t = 1, since 2 > 1 she would drown. So Koa waits 1 second instead and beach looks like [\underline{s}, 2, 1, i] at t = 1. 
  * At t = 1 Koa swims to x = 1, beach looks like [s, \underline{1}, 0, i] at t = 2. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 2 Koa swims to x = 2, beach looks like [s, 2, \underline{1}, i] at t = 3. Koa doesn't drown because 1 ≤ 1. 
  * At t = 3 Koa swims to x = 3, beach looks like [s, 1, 0, \underline{i}] at t = 4. 
  * At t = 4 Koa is at x = 3 and she made it! 



We can show that in test case 2 Koa can't get to the island.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `L`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. For each set of inputs, the function checks if it is possible to place a sequence of numbers (from the list `ar`) in a way that no two adjacent numbers exceed a certain limit defined by `L` and `k`. Specifically, the function ensures that no number in `ar` exceeds `L`, and for any two consecutive numbers `x` and `y` in the sequence, the condition `x + k <= y` holds true. If the sequence can be arranged according to these rules, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function continues processing until all sets of inputs have been evaluated. After execution, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each set of inputs, reflecting whether the conditions were met for each case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list is derived from a string obtained by splitting the input provided by the user. If the user input is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will either return an empty list or raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert a non-integer string to an integer.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(o):
    return [int(x) + o for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and reads a space-separated string from the standard input. It converts each substring into an integer, adds `o` to it, and returns a list of these results. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The value of `o` remains unchanged. The function does not handle any other types of input errors or edge cases, such as empty input strings or invalid input formats.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer) and `m` (of any type, but unused). It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` `n` times. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. The variable `m` does not influence the function's behavior or output.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(f, *dim):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a callable `f` and a variable number of non-negative integer arguments `*dim`. If `*dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a nested list where each level of the list corresponds to one dimension specified in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`. Each element in the nested list is the result of calling `f()`. Edge cases include scenarios where `*dim` contains zero values, resulting in empty sublists at those levels, and the case where `f` returns a mutable object, which could lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
