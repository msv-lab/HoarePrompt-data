Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires checking if Koa can reach the island without drowning, considering the tidal effects on the depths. However, the function `func_1` appears to be checking a different condition that does not align with the problem's requirements. The function checks if no number in `ar` exceeds `L` and if the condition `x + k <= L` holds for consecutive elements, which is not the same as the tidal effect described in the problem.

The tidal effect involves a periodic increase and decrease in depth, and Koa can only move when the depth is within a safe limit. The function `func_1` does not account for this periodic change in depth and does not simulate the movement of Koa through the sea while considering the tidal effects. Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

For example, consider the test case:
```
5 2 3
1 2 3 2 2
```
The correct answer should be `No` because at some point, the depth will exceed the limit `l` due to the tidal effect, making it impossible for Koa to safely swim to the island. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle this scenario and may produce an incorrect result.
