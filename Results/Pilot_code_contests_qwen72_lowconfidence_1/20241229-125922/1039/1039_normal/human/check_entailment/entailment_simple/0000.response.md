Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Misuse of Variables**: The function `func_1` reads the input for `n`, `k`, and `L` using `func_2`, but then incorrectly uses `func_2` again to read the array `ar`. This causes the program to read the next line of input as a single integer rather than a list of integers, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Tide Effect**: The program does not correctly account for the tide effect described in the problem. The problem states that the tide increases and decreases the depth in a cyclic manner, but the program does not simulate this effect. Instead, it uses a simple check to determine if the depth exceeds the limit `L` at any point, which is insufficient.

3. **Handling of Tide Cycles**: The program does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the tide. The tide cycle is described as increasing and decreasing over `2k` seconds, but the program does not simulate this cycle. It only checks if the depth plus `k` exceeds `L`, which is not enough to ensure Koa can safely swim to the island.

4. **Incorrect Use of `pos` Variable**: The `pos` variable is used to track the position, but its usage is unclear and does not correctly simulate the movement and depth checks required by the problem. The logic for updating `pos` and checking the limits is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Read the input correctly for `n`, `k`, and `L`.
- Read the array `ar` correctly.
- Simulate the tide effect by considering the cyclic nature of the depth changes.
- Check if Koa can swim to the island by ensuring the depth at each meter does not exceed `L` at any point during the tide cycle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_koa_swim(n, k, L, ar):
    p = [i for i in range(k)] + [k - i for i in range(k)]
    for x in range(n):
        max_depth = max(ar[x] + p[i % (2 * k)] for i in range(2 * k))
        if max_depth > L:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, L = map(int, input().split())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_koa_swim(n, k, L, ar):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `L`, followed by the array `ar`.

2. **Simulating Tide Effect**: The array `p` is constructed to represent the tide effect over `2k` seconds. The maximum depth at each meter is calculated by considering the depth plus the tide effect at each second in the cycle.

3. **Checking Depth**: For each meter, the program checks if the maximum depth exceeds `L`. If it does, Koa cannot swim to the island, and the program prints 'No'. If all depths are within the limit, the program prints 'Yes'.

This corrected program ensures that the tide effect is correctly simulated and that Koa's ability to swim to the island is accurately determined.
