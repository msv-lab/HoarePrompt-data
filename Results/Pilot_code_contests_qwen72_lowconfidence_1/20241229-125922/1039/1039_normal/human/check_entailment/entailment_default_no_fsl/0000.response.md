Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code in `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for checking if Koa can swim to the island without drowning is flawed. The function attempts to check if each depth in the array `ar` is within the allowed limit `L` and tries to manage a position `pos` to track the tide's effect, but it does not accurately simulate the tide's cyclic nature and the constraints on Koa's movement.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Tide Cycles**: The function does not correctly account for the tide cycle, which alternates between increasing and decreasing depths. The tide cycle is defined by the array `p = [0, 1, 2, ..., k-1, k, k-1, ..., 2, 1]` and repeats every `2k` seconds. The function should ensure that at any time `t`, the depth at position `i` is `d_i + p[t % 2k]` and should not exceed `L`.

2. **Flawed Position Management**: The variable `pos` is used to track the position relative to the tide, but it is not managed correctly. The logic for updating `pos` and checking the limits is incorrect and does not reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Missing Depth Checks**: The function does not correctly check the depth at each position for all possible tide phases. It should verify that for each position `i`, the depth `d_i + p[t % 2k]` does not exceed `L` for all `t` in the range `[0, 2k-1]`.

A correct implementation would need to simulate the tide cycles and check the depth constraints for each position at all relevant times. The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. For example, the test case where the tide cycle and depth constraints are more complex would likely fail with the current logic.
