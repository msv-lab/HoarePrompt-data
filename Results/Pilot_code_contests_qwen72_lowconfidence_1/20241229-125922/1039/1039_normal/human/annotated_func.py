#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, L are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9. ar is a list of n integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n such that 0 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n`, `k`, `L` are the values returned by `func_2()` each time the outer loop runs, `ar` is a list of `n` integers \(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n\) such that \(0 \leq d_i \leq 10^9\). `pos` is either `None` or the last computed value based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop, if any element `x` in `ar` is greater than `L` or if `x + k > L` and `pos` is `None`, the program prints 'No' and the loop terminates early. If the loop completes without breaking, the program prints 'Yes'. After all iterations of the outer loop, the program will have printed 'No' or 'Yes' for each set of `n`, `k`, `L`, and `ar` provided by `func_2()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `L`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. For each set of inputs, the function checks if it is possible to place a sequence of numbers (from the list `ar`) in a way that no two adjacent numbers exceed a certain limit defined by `L` and `k`. Specifically, the function ensures that no number in `ar` exceeds `L`, and for any two consecutive numbers `x` and `y` in the sequence, the condition `x + k <= y` holds true. If the sequence can be arranged according to these rules, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function continues processing until all sets of inputs have been evaluated. After execution, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each set of inputs, reflecting whether the conditions were met for each case.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from a string obtained by splitting the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers. Each integer in the list is derived from a string obtained by splitting the input provided by the user. If the user input is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will either return an empty list or raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert a non-integer string to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is an integer.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list where each element is the result of converting a string from the input (split by spaces) into an integer and adding the integer `o` to it. The value of `o` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and reads a space-separated string from the standard input. It converts each substring into an integer, adds `o` to it, and returns a list of these results. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The value of `o` remains unchanged. The function does not handle any other types of input errors or edge cases, such as empty input strings or invalid input formats.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, m is not used in the function and can be of any type.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` `n` times, where `n` is a non-negative integer. The variable `m` is not used in the function and does not affect the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer) and `m` (of any type, but unused). It returns a list containing the results of calling `func_2()` `n` times. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. The variable `m` does not influence the function's behavior or output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable function, and *dim is a tuple of non-negative integers representing the dimensions of the nested list to be created.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a nested list of calls to `f()` with the structure defined by `*dim`. If `dim` is empty, the program returns the result of calling `f()`. Each level of the nested list corresponds to one dimension in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a callable `f` and a variable number of non-negative integer arguments `*dim`. If `*dim` is empty, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it constructs and returns a nested list where each level of the list corresponds to one dimension specified in `*dim`, and the length of each sublist at a given level is determined by the corresponding value in `*dim`. Each element in the nested list is the result of calling `f()`. Edge cases include scenarios where `*dim` contains zero values, resulting in empty sublists at those levels, and the case where `f` returns a mutable object, which could lead to unintended side effects if not handled carefully.
