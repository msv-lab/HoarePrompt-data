The function `func_1` reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and `L`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. For each set of inputs, the function checks if it is possible to place a sequence of numbers (from the list `ar`) in a way that no two adjacent numbers exceed a certain limit defined by `L` and `k`. Specifically, the function ensures that no number in `ar` exceeds `L`, and for any two consecutive numbers `x` and `y` in the sequence, the condition `x + k <= y` holds true. If the sequence can be arranged according to these rules, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function continues processing until all sets of inputs have been evaluated. After execution, the program will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each set of inputs, reflecting whether the conditions were met for each case.
