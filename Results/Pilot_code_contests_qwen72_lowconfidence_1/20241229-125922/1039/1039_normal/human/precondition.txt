t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains three integers n, k, and l such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers d_1, d_2, …, d_n such that 0 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
