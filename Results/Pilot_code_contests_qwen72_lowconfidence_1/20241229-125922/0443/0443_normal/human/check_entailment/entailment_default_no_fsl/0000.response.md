Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the condition that "there is at least one south magnet in every row and every column." The current implementation only checks if there is at least one black cell in each row and column, which is insufficient to ensure that the placement of south magnets meets the requirement.

Additionally, the function does not account for the requirement that "if a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement." The current implementation only checks if black cells are adjacent to other black cells in the same row or column, but it does not verify if it is possible to move a north magnet to every black cell through a sequence of operations.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
#..
..#
.##
```

Expected output: `-1`
Actual output: `1`

In this case, the grid has black cells in each row and column, but it is impossible to place south magnets such that a north magnet can move to all black cells. The current implementation incorrectly returns `1`, indicating that it is possible to place the magnets, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
