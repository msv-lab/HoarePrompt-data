You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.

There is an n× m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.

An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.

Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.

  1. There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column. 
  2. If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 
  3. If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 



Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next n lines describe the coloring. The i-th of these lines contains a string of length m, where the j-th character denotes the color of the cell in row i and column j. The characters "#" and "." represent black and white, respectively. It is guaranteed, that the string will not contain any other characters.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of north magnets required.

If there is no placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions, print a single integer -1.

Note

In the first test, here is an example placement of magnets:

<image>

In the second test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are three example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 3 since we can move the north magnet down onto a white square. The second example violates rule 2 since we cannot move the north magnet to the bottom-left black square by any sequence of operations. The third example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first column.

<image>

In the third test, here is an example placement of magnets. We can show that there is no required placement of magnets with fewer north magnets.

<image>

In the fourth test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are two example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first row. The second example violates rules 1 and 3 since there is no south magnet in the second row and we can move the north magnet up one unit onto a white square.

<image>

In the fifth test, we can put the south magnet in each cell and no north magnets. Because there are no black cells, it will be a correct placement.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. One specific issue is in the way the `DisjointSetUnion` class is used and initialized. The `DisjointSetUnion` class is not defined in the provided code, which is essential for the union-find operations. Without this class, the program cannot correctly manage the connected components of black cells, which is crucial for determining the minimum number of north magnets required.

Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of valid placements of south magnets in every row and column, and ensuring that black cells can be reached by north magnets, and white cells cannot, is not fully verified. For example, the condition `exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` and `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` does not correctly enforce the requirement that black cells must be reachable by north magnets moving only in the same row or column.

A more detailed analysis would involve constructing specific test cases, but the absence of the `DisjointSetUnion` class and the incomplete logic for validating the placement of magnets are sufficient to conclude that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

If `cols` and `rows` are both empty and `black` is False, and `exists` is True, then `func_2(n * m - white)` has been called. Otherwise, either `cols` is not empty, or `rows` is not empty, or `black` is True, or `exists` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a grid from standard input, where the grid is defined by dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and each cell is represented by a character "#" (black) or "." (white). It processes the grid to identify connected components of black cells ("#") using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. The function also checks several conditions to determine if the grid meets specific criteria:

1. All black cells ("#") are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column.
2. There is at least one black cell in the grid.
3. All rows and columns contain at least one black cell.

If these conditions are met, the function calls `func_2` with the number of connected components of black cells minus the number of white cells. If any of these conditions are not met, `func_2` is called with `-1`.

After the function executes:
- `n` and `m` remain the dimensions of the grid.
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent black cells.
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a black cell.
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a black cell.
- `cols` is a set containing all row indices that did not have a black cell.
- `rows` is a set containing all column indices that did not have a black cell.
- `exists` is `True` if all black cells are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column, otherwise `False`.
- `black` is `True` if there is at least one black cell in the grid, otherwise `False`.
- `white` is the total number of white cells in the grid.
- `prev_row` is the last row read from the input.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the grid is entirely white (no black cells), the function will still correctly call `func_2(-1)`.
- If the grid is entirely black, the function will call `func_2(1)` since there is only one connected component of black cells.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer dimensions or invalid characters in the grid), which could lead to runtime errors.

After writing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline `'\n'` if not provided). If the `flush` parameter in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the output is immediately flushed to the file. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` if they exist, and potentially `'flush'` if it is used. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the file except the `end` string.
