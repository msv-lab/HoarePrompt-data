Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the condition that there must be at least one south magnet in every row and every column. The current implementation only checks if there is at least one black cell in each row and column, but it does not ensure that there is at least one south magnet placed in every row and column, which is a requirement according to the problem description.

Additionally, the function does not correctly handle the condition that a north magnet can only move to a black cell if there is a path through black cells that are connected in the same row or column. The current implementation only checks if black cells are adjacent, but it does not ensure that a north magnet can reach every black cell in the grid.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
  ```
  #.
  .#
  ```
  In this case, the function will incorrectly return `-1` because it does not have a black cell in every row and column. However, it is possible to place a south magnet in each cell and a north magnet in one of the black cells, satisfying all the conditions.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
