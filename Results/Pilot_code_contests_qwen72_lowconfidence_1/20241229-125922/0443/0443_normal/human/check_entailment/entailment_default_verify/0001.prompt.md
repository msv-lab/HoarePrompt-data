You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care.

There is an n× m grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell.

An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable.

Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.

  1. There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column. 
  2. If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 
  3. If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement. 



Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n,m≤ 1000) — the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next n lines describe the coloring. The i-th of these lines contains a string of length m, where the j-th character denotes the color of the cell in row i and column j. The characters "#" and "." represent black and white, respectively. It is guaranteed, that the string will not contain any other characters.

Output

Output a single integer, the minimum possible number of north magnets required.

If there is no placement of magnets that satisfies all conditions, print a single integer -1.

Note

In the first test, here is an example placement of magnets:

<image>

In the second test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are three example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 3 since we can move the north magnet down onto a white square. The second example violates rule 2 since we cannot move the north magnet to the bottom-left black square by any sequence of operations. The third example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first column.

<image>

In the third test, here is an example placement of magnets. We can show that there is no required placement of magnets with fewer north magnets.

<image>

In the fourth test, we can show that no required placement of magnets exists. Here are two example placements that fail to meet the requirements. The first example violates rule 1 since there is no south magnet in the first row. The second example violates rules 1 and 3 since there is no south magnet in the second row and we can move the north magnet up one unit onto a white square.

In the fifth test, we can put the south magnet in each cell and no north magnets. Because there are no black cells, it will be a correct placement.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are some specific issues and test cases where the program fails:

1. **Handling of Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization and Operations**:
   - The `DisjointSetUnion` class is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical part of the algorithm, and without it, the program cannot function as intended.
   
2. **Logic for Ensuring South Magnets in Every Row and Column**:
   - The logic for ensuring that there is at least one south magnet in every row and column is not robust. The variables `cols` and `rows` are used to track which rows and columns still need a south magnet, but the logic for updating these sets is not clear and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
   
3. **Handling Black and White Cells**:
   - The program attempts to ensure that black cells can be reached by north magnets and white cells cannot. However, the logic for checking this is flawed. For example, the condition `exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` and `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` is too restrictive and may incorrectly reject valid configurations.

4. **Test Case Failure**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     3 3
     .#.
     #.#
     .#.
     ```
     In this case, the grid has a pattern where black cells are isolated and cannot be reached by north magnets moving in a single step. The program should output `-1`, but due to the flawed logic, it may output an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` prints the values from the tuple `args` to a specified file (or `sys.stdout` by default), separated by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space `' '` if not provided). After writing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline `'\n'` if not provided). If the `flush` parameter in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the output is immediately flushed to the file. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` if they exist, and potentially `'flush'` if it is used. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the file except the `end` string.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
