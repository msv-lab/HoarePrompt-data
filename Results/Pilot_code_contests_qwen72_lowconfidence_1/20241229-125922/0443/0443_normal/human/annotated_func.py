#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to `func_1()`.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent cells that are '#' horizontally or vertically across all rows. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a '#'. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a '#'. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column across all rows. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row across all columns. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in the grid are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in the grid, otherwise it is False. `white` is the total number of '.' characters in the grid. `prev_row` is equal to the last row read from the input. If `cols` and `rows` are both empty and `black` is False, and `exists` is True, then `func_2(n * m - white)` has been called. Otherwise, either `cols` is not empty, or `rows` is not empty, or `black` is True, or `exists` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a grid from standard input, where the grid is defined by dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and each cell is represented by a character "#" (black) or "." (white). It processes the grid to identify connected components of black cells ("#") using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. The function also checks several conditions to determine if the grid meets specific criteria:

1. All black cells ("#") are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column.
2. There is at least one black cell in the grid.
3. All rows and columns contain at least one black cell.

If these conditions are met, the function calls `func_2` with the number of connected components of black cells minus the number of white cells. If any of these conditions are not met, `func_2` is called with `-1`.

After the function executes:
- `n` and `m` remain the dimensions of the grid.
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent black cells.
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a black cell.
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a black cell.
- `cols` is a set containing all row indices that did not have a black cell.
- `rows` is a set containing all column indices that did not have a black cell.
- `exists` is `True` if all black cells are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column, otherwise `False`.
- `black` is `True` if there is at least one black cell in the grid, otherwise `False`.
- `white` is the total number of white cells in the grid.
- `prev_row` is the last row read from the input.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the grid is entirely white (no black cells), the function will still correctly call `func_2(-1)`.
- If the grid is entirely black, the function will call `func_2(1)` since there is only one connected component of black cells.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer dimensions or invalid characters in the grid), which could lead to runtime errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args, 'file' is a file-like object to which the output is written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True

        if not at_start:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `True`, and the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the key 'flush' (but not 'end' or 'file'), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `True`, and the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. The value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the content has been flushed to `file`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the values from the tuple `args` to a specified file (or `sys.stdout` by default), separated by the string `sep` (defaulting to a space `' '` if not provided). After writing all values, it appends the string `end` (defaulting to a newline `'\n'` if not provided). If the `flush` parameter in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the output is immediately flushed to the file. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, and `'end'` if they exist, and potentially `'flush'` if it is used. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the file except the `end` string.
