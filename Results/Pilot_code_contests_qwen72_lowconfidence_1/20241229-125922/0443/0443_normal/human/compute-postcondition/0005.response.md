The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object specified by `file`. Since `sep` is either the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, and `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, this operation does not change the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, it does write the content to the specified file.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must be non-empty, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `at_start` is `False`, `x` is not defined yet, the value of `sep` has been written to `file`.**
