The code snippet `rows.discard(j)` removes the value of `j` from the set `rows`. Given that `j` is 1, the set `rows` will no longer contain the value 1 if it was present. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` and `row[j]` are both '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 1, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding 0 and 1 (1 has been removed), `f_col[1]` is 1, `f_row[0]` is 1, `f_row[1]` is 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, if `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 1**
