Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`. `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`. `exists` is updated to `exists & True`. `black` is True if `row[j] == '#'`, otherwise `black` is determined by the presence of '#' in `row`. `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#'. `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'`.***
