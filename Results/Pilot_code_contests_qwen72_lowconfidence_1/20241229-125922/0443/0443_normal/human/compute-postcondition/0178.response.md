Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent cells that are '#' horizontally or vertically across all rows. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a '#'. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a '#'. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column across all rows. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row across all columns. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in the grid are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in the grid, otherwise it is False. `white` is the total number of '.' characters in the grid. `prev_row` is equal to the last row read from the input.**
