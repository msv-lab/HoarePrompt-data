The code snippet `cols.discard(i)` removes the value of `i` from the set `cols` if `i` is present in `cols`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable)
- `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `f_row[j]` is 2
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is updated to `exists & True`
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged
- `f_col[2]` is `j`

After executing the code snippet `cols.discard(i)`, the value `2` is removed from the set `cols` if it is present. 

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[j]` is 2, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is updated to `exists & True`, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged, `f_col[2]` is `j`**
