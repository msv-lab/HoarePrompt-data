The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure between the elements `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'
- `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, and `dsu` also contains a union between elements `m + 2` and `2`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet:

- `dsu` now contains a union between the elements `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, this translates to a union between elements `1 * m + 2` and `1 * m + 1`, which simplifies to `m + 2` and `m + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between elements `m + 1` and `m`, `m + 2` and `2`, and `m + 2` and `m + 1`, `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
