The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation in the `dsu` (Disjoint Set Union) object between the nodes at positions `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions `1` and `-m + 1`.
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0.
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0.
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`.
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`.
- `exists` is True.
- `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True.
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1.
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.').
- `row` is an input string.
- `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'.

After executing the code snippet:
- The `dsu` object now includes the union of nodes at positions `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this translates to `dsu.union(1, 0)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and 0, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and -m + 1, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**
