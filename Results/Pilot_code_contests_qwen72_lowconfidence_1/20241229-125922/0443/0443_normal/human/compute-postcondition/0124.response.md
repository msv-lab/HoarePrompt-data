To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to run. The loop iterates over the range of `m`, so the primary condition is that `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is the input string

For the loop to execute:
- `m` must be greater than 0 (since the loop iterates from 0 to `m-1`).

The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the loop counter.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 1. The other variables do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state and should be included in the final state description.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is the input string, `j` is 0**
