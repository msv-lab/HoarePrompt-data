The code `dsu.union(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. This operation merges the sets containing the elements `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `i`: The row index, currently 1.
   - `m`: The number of columns, an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
   - `j`: The column index, currently 0.
   - `dsu`: A `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The first element to be unioned is `i * m + j`.
     - Given `i = 1` and `j = 0`, this evaluates to `1 * m + 0 = m`.
   - The second element to be unioned is `(i - 1) * m + j`.
     - Given `i = 1`, this evaluates to `(1 - 1) * m + 0 = 0`.

3. **Effect**:
   - The `dsu.union` method will merge the sets containing the elements `m` and `0`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The union operation affects the internal state of the `dsu` object.
   - No other variables are changed by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and now contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, and the current value of `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` is '#'.**
