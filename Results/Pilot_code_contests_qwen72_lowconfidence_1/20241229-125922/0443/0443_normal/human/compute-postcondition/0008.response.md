The code snippet `at_start = False` changes the value of `at_start` from `True` to `False`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must be non-empty, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `at_start` is `False`, `x` is the first element of `args`, and the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
