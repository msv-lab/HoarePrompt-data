The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)` performs a union operation between two nodes in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. Specifically, it unions the node at position `(i * m + j)` with the node at position `((i - 1) * m + j)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1
- The character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Union Operation**:
   - The union operation is performed between the nodes at positions `(i * m + j)` and `((i - 1) * m + j)`.
   - Given `i` is 0, the positions become:
     - Node 1: `0 * m + j = j`
     - Node 2: `(0 - 1) * m + j = -m + j`

2. **Validating Positions**:
   - Since `i` is 0, `(i - 1)` is -1, which means the second position `((i - 1) * m + j)` is `-m + j`.
   - For `j` being 1, the positions are:
     - Node 1: `j = 1`
     - Node 2: `-m + 1`

3. **Impact on DSU**:
   - The union operation will affect the internal state of the `dsu` object, specifically the parent and rank arrays, but the exact changes depend on the implementation of the `union` method in the `dsu` class.
   - The union operation does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `f_col`, `f_row`, `cols`, `rows`, `exists`, `black`, `white`, `prev_row`, or `row`.

Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged, except for the internal state of the `dsu` object, which now includes the union of the nodes at positions `1` and `-m + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and now includes the union of nodes at positions `1` and `-m + 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**.
