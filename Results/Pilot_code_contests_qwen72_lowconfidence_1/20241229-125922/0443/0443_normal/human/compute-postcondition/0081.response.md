Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `f_row[0]` is 1
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- `row[j]` is '#'

Code Snippet:
```
f_col[i] = j
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The value of `f_col[i]` is updated to `j`.
2. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, `f_col[1]` is updated to 0.

Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `f_row[0]` is 1
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- `row[j]` is '#'
