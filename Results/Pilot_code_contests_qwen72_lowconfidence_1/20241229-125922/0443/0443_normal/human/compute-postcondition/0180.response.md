The function `func_2` is called with the argument `len(dsu) - white`. Here, `len(dsu)` represents the size of the `dsu` object, which is initialized with size `n * m`. The variable `white` is the total number of '.' characters in the grid.

The calculation for the argument passed to `func_2` is:
- `len(dsu)` = `n * m` (since `dsu` is initialized with size `n * m`)
- `len(dsu) - white` = `n * m - white`

The function `func_2` is executed with this calculated value, but the details of what `func_2` does are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes to the state beyond the fact that `func_2` is called with the specified argument.

Since the function call itself does not modify any of the variables explicitly mentioned in the initial state, the state remains largely unchanged, except for the fact that `func_2` has been called with the specified argument.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent cells that are '#' horizontally or vertically across all rows. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a '#'. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a '#'. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column across all rows. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row across all columns. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in the grid are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in the grid, otherwise it is False. `white` is the total number of '.' characters in the grid. `prev_row` is equal to the last row read from the input. The sets `cols` and `rows` are both empty or `black` is False, and `exists` is True. `func_2(n * m - white)` has been called.**
