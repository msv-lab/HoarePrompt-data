The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. This operation unites the elements at positions `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- If `row[j]` is '#', `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, `cols` excludes 1, `rows` excludes 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, and `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- If `row[j]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, and `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1

After executing the code snippet:
- The DSU data structure `dsu` now contains a union between the elements at positions `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`
- Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the positions are `1 * m + 1` and `(1 - 1) * m + 1`, which simplifies to `m + 1` and `1`

The output state remains the same for all other variables and conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and now contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `1`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, if `row[j]` is '#', `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, `cols` excludes 1, `rows` excludes 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, and `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, if `row[j]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, and `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 1**.
