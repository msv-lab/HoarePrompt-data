Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, and `dsu` also contains a union between elements `m + 2` and `2`. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`. `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0. `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1. `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1. `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string. `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.***
