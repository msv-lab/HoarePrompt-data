Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2 if `f_col[1]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, and `f_row[2]` is 1 if `f_row[2]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.

The code snippet:
```
exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `exists` is a boolean variable that is currently True.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `f_col[1]` is either 2 (if it was initially -1) or some other value based on the conditions provided.
4. `j` is 2.
5. The expression `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` evaluates to a boolean value.
6. `exists` is updated to the logical AND of its current value (True) and the result of the expression `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2`.

Let's evaluate `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2`:
- `f_col[1]` is 2 (if it was initially -1) or some other value.
- `j` is 2.
- If `f_col[1]` is 2, then `abs(2 - 2) = 0`, which is less than 2, so the expression evaluates to True.
- If `f_col[1]` is not 2, let's say it is `x`, then `abs(x - 2) < 2` must be evaluated:
  - If `x` is 1 or 3, then `abs(x - 2) = 1`, which is less than 2, so the expression evaluates to True.
  - If `x` is any other value, the expression evaluates to False.

Since `exists` is currently True, the final value of `exists` will be the result of the expression `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2`.

Output State:
- If `f_col[1]` is 2, 1, or 3, `exists` remains True.
- If `f_col[1]` is any other value, `exists` becomes False.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2 if `f_col[1]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, and `f_row[2]` is 1 if `f_row[2]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1, `exists` is True if `f_col[1]` is 2, 1, or 3, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
