The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. The state of the program before executing this code depends on whether `at_start` is True or False. After executing the code:

- If `at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep`, and `sep` remains unchanged. The file pointer will be further advanced by the length of the string representation of `x`.
- If `at_start` is True, the state of the program remains as initially described, and the file pointer will be advanced by the length of the string representation of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **If `at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)`, and `sep` remains unchanged. If `at_start` is True, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `str(x)`, and `sep` remains unchanged.**
