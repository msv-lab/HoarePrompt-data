Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the key 'flush' (but not 'end' or 'file'), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `True`, and the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. The value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`, the content has been flushed to `file`.***
