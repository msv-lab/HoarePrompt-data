The code `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation between the elements at indices `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1` in the `DisjointSetUnion` object `dsu`.

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
   - If `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`.
   - `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable).
   - `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`.
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row.
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column.
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2.
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`.
   - `exists` is updated to `exists & True`.
   - `black` is True if `row[j] == '#'`, otherwise `black` is determined by the presence of '#' in `row`.
   - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#'.
   - `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` operation affects the `dsu` object by performing a union between the elements at indices `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The `dsu` object now reflects the union between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and has performed the union operation between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, if `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`, `exists` is updated to `exists & True`, `black` is True if `row[j] == '#'`, otherwise `black` is determined by the presence of '#' in `row`, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'`.**
