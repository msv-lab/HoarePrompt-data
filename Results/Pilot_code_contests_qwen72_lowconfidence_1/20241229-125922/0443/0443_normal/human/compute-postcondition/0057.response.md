The value of `exists` is updated based on the evaluation of the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. The `&=` operator performs a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `exists` and the result of the condition. If the condition evaluates to `True`, `exists` remains unchanged; if the condition evaluates to `False`, `exists` becomes `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **The value of `exists` is updated to `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
