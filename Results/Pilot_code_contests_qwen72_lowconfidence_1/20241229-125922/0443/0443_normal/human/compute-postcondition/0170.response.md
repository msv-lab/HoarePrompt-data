The code snippet `f_col[i] = j` updates the value of the element in the list `f_col` at index `i` to `j`. The variable `exists` is mentioned as the only variable that changes in the initial state, but this code snippet does not affect `exists`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `f_col[i]` and the unchanged status of `exists`.

Output State: **`f_col[i]` is `j`, `exists` is the only variable that changes, all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**
