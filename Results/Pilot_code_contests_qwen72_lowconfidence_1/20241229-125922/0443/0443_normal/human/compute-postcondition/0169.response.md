The given code updates the `exists` variable based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Check the Previous Values of the Affected Variables:**
   - `exists`: This is a boolean value that is being updated.
   - `f_row[j]`: This is an element in the list `f_row` at index `j`.
   - `i`: This is an integer value, initially set to 2.
   - `j`: This is an integer value, set to `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The code `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` updates `exists` to the logical AND of its current value and the result of the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.
   - If `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` evaluates to `True`, `exists` remains unchanged.
   - If `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` evaluates to `False`, `exists` becomes `False`.

3. **Update the Output State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `exists`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`, if `j` and `row[j] == row[j - 1] == '#'`, `dsu` performs a union operation between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`, `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'` and `f_col[2]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[2]` remains unchanged, `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise `f_row[j]` remains unchanged.**
