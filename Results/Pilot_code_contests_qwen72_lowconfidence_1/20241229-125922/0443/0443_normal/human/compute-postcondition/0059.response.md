The value of `f_row[j]` is updated to `i`. The value of `exists` remains `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, and `f_col[i]` remains `j`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f_row[j]` is `i`, `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
