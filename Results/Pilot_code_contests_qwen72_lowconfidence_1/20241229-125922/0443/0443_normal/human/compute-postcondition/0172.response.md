The code `cols.discard(i)` removes the element `i` from the set `cols` if `i` is present in `cols`. If `i` is not in `cols`, the set remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `f_col[i]` is `j`
- `f_row[j]` is `i`
- `exists` changes (specific change not defined)
- All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.

After executing the code snippet:
- `i` is removed from the set `cols` if it was present.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`f_col[i]` is `j`, `f_row[j]` is `i`, `exists` changes (specific change not defined), `i` is removed from the set `cols` if it was present, all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.**
