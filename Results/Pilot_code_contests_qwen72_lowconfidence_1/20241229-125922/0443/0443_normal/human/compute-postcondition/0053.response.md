The code snippet sets the variable `black` to `True`. This overrides the condition that `black` is `False` if `row[j]` is not '#'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `j` is such that `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is '#', `dsu` performs a union between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#': `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'). If `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#'), `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.').**
