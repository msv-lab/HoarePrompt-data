The code snippet updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value. If `f_row[j]` is not -1, it remains unchanged. If `f_row[j]` is -1, it is updated to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- `row[j]` is '#'

Impact of the code:
- The value of `f_row[j]` is updated to 1 if it was -1. If it was already 1 or some other non-negative value, it remains unchanged.

Since `j` is 0, the specific impact is:
- `f_row[0]` is updated to 1 if it was -1. If it was already 1 or some other non-negative value, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[0]` is 1 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, `row[j]` is '#'**
