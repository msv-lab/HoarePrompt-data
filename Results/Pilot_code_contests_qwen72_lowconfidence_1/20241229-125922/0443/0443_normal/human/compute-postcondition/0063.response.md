Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `row[j]` is '#': `f_row[j]` is `i`, `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, `cols` does not contain `i`, `rows` does not contain `j` if it was present, `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` are unchanged, `black` is True, `white` is 0, and `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'). If `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#'), `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0, `exists` is True, `black` is False, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, and `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.').***
