The code snippet `cols.discard(i)` removes the element `i` from the set `cols` if it exists in the set. If `i` is not in the set, the set remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `f_row[j]` is `i`
- `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`
- `f_col[i]` is `j`

The impact of the code is:
- The set `cols` may or may not be modified depending on whether `i` is present in `cols`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `f_row[j]` is `i`
- `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`
- `f_col[i]` is `j`
- `cols` does not contain `i` (if `i` was in `cols` before the operation, it is now removed; otherwise, `cols` remains unchanged)

Output State: **`f_row[j]` is `i`, `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, `cols` does not contain `i`**
