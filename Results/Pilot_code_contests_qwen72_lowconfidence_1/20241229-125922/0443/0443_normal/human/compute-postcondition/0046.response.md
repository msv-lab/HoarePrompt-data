The code snippet `white += 1` increments the value of the variable `white` by 1. Given the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `white` and ensure that all other conditions remain unchanged.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `row[j - 1]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and 0
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and -m + 1
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `white` is incremented by 1.

### Calculation:
- If `row[j]` is '#', then `white` was initially 0. After incrementing, `white` becomes 1.
- If `row[j]` is not '#', then `white` was initially 1. After incrementing, `white` becomes 2.

### Output State:
- If `row[j]` is '#':
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `i` is 0
  - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
  - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
  - If `row[j]` and `row[j - 1]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and 0
  - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and -m + 1
  - `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0
  - `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
  - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
  - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is True
  - `white` is 1
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
  - `row` is an input string
  - `j` is 1

- If `row[j]` is not '#':
  - `n` is greater than 0
  - `i` is 0
  - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
  - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
  - If `row[j]` and `row[j - 1]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and 0
  - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` includes the union of nodes at positions 1 and -m + 1
  - `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0
  - `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
  - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
  - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is False
  - `white` is 2
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
  - `row` is an input string
  - `j` is 1
