The code snippet `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` updates the variable `exists` based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
   - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
   - `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
   - `f_row[0]` is 1 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
   - `exists` is True
   - `black` is True
   - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
   - `prev_row` is equal to `row`
   - `row` is an input string
   - `j` is 0
   - `row[j]` is '#'

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The expression `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` evaluates to a boolean value.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, we need to evaluate `abs(f_row[0] - 1) < 2`.
   - Given that `f_row[0]` is 1 (as it was -1 and got updated to 1), the expression `abs(1 - 1) < 2` simplifies to `abs(0) < 2`, which is `True`.
   - The `&=` operator performs a logical AND assignment, so `exists &= True` does not change the value of `exists`.

3. **Output State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
   - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
   - `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
   - `f_row[0]` is 1
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
   - `exists` is True
   - `black` is True
   - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
   - `prev_row` is equal to `row`
   - `row` is an input string
   - `j` is 0
   - `row[j]` is '#'

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[0]` is 1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, `row[j]` is '#'**
