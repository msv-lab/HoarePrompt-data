The code snippet updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value. If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it is updated to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable)
- `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged
- `f_col[2]` is `j` if `f_col[2]` was `-1`; otherwise, `f_col[2]` remains unchanged

After executing the code:
- If `f_row[j]` is `-1`, it will be updated to `2` (the value of `i`).
- If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise `f_row[j]` remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged, `f_col[2]` is `j` if `f_col[2]` was `-1`; otherwise, `f_col[2]` remains unchanged**
