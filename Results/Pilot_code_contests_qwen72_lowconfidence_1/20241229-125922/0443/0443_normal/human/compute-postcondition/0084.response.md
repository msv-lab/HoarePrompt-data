The code `rows.discard(j)` removes the value of `j` from the set `rows` if `j` is present in `rows`. Given that `j` is 0 and `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, excluding 1, this means 0 will be removed from `rows` if it is present.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[0]` is 1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 1, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, `row[j]` is '#'**
