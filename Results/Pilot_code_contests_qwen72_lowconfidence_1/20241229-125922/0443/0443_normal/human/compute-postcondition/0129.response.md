The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. Specifically, it unites the sets containing the elements at indices `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is the input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#'
- The character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#'

The impact of the code:
- The `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` operation will unite the sets containing the elements at indices `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, this translates to `dsu.union(2 * m + 0, 2 * m - 1)`, which simplifies to `dsu.union(2 * m, 2 * m - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and now contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is the input string, `j` is 0, the character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#', and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#'**.
