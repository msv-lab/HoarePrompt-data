The code `rows.discard(j)` removes the element `j` from the set `rows` if it is present. Given that `j` is 0, and `rows` initially contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`, the element 0 will be removed from `rows`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `j` is greater than 0 and the characters at index `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the sets containing the elements at indices 0 and -1 in `dsu` are united
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with `f_row[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `m-1` (0 is removed)
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at index `j` in `row` is '#'

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` is greater than 0 and the characters at index `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the sets containing the elements at indices 0 and -1 in `dsu` are united, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with `f_row[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` in `row` is '#'**
