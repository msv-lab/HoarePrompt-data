The code snippet updates the `exists` variable based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `exists`: A boolean variable that is updated.
   - `f_row[j]`: The value at index `j` (which is 2) in the list `f_row`.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is 1.

2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`: This checks if the absolute difference between `f_row[2]` and `1` is less than 2.
   - Since `j` is 2, we need to know the value of `f_row[2]`.

3. **Possible Values for `f_row[2]`**:
   - According to the initial state, `f_row[2]` is 1 if it was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, `f_row[2]` can be either 1 or some other value (if it was not -1 initially).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - If `f_row[2]` is 1, then `abs(1 - 1) = 0`, which is less than 2.
   - If `f_row[2]` is some other value (let's say `x`), then `abs(x - 1) < 2` must be evaluated.

5. **Update `exists`**:
   - If the condition `abs(f_row[2] - 1) < 2` is true, `exists` remains unchanged.
   - If the condition is false, `exists` becomes `False`.

Given that `m` must be greater than 2, and `f_row[2]` is 1 if it was initially -1, let's assume `f_row[2]` is 1 for simplicity (since it's the most common case given the initial state).

Therefore, the condition `abs(1 - 1) < 2` is true, and `exists` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2 if `f_col[1]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, and `f_row[2]` is 1 if `f_row[2]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1, `exists` is True if `f_col[1]` is 2, 1, or 3, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `exists` remains unchanged.**
