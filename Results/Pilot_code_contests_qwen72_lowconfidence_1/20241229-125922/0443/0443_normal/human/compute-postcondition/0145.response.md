The code snippet provided performs a union operation using the `dsu` (Disjoint Set Union) object. This operation connects two elements within the disjoint sets managed by `dsu`. The specific elements being connected are `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration
- `m` must be greater than `k + 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged. If `row[j]` is '#', `j` is discarded from the set `rows`, `exists` is updated to `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is set to `j`, `f_row[j]` is set to `i`, and `i` is removed from `cols`. If `row[j]` is not '#', `white` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet:
```python
dsu.union(i * m + j, (i - 1) * m + j)
```

Impact:
- The `dsu.union` method is called, which connects the elements `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j` in the disjoint set.

Since this operation does not modify any of the variables directly, the only change is the internal state of the `dsu` object. The variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `f_col`, `f_row`, `cols`, `rows`, `exists`, `black`, and `white` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and has performed the union of `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged.**
