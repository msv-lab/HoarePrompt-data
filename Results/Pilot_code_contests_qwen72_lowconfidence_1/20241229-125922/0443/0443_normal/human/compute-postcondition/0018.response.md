The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, there is no change to its value. The other variables (`file`, `sep`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)` from the previous iteration plus the length of `str(x)`, `sep` remains unchanged, and `x` is the next element in `args`.**
