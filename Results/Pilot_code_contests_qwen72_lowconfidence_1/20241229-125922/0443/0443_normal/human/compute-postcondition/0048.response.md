To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to run. The loop iterates over the range `m`, which means it will continue as long as `j` is less than `m`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` is '#':
  - `f_col[0]` is set to 0
  - `f_row[0]` is set to 0
  - `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
  - `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is True
  - `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- If `row[j]` is not '#':
  - `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#')
  - `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is False
  - `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute one more time if `j < m`.
2. **Increment `j`**: Since the loop is a `for` loop iterating over `range(m)`, the value of `j` will automatically increment by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - The values of `f_col`, `f_row`, `cols`, `rows`, `exists`, `black`, `white`, and `prev_row` will depend on the value of `row[j]` at the new position.

### Adjusted State:

- `n` remains greater than 0
- `i` remains 0
- `m` remains an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` remains a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `j` is incremented by 1
- If `row[j]` is '#':
  - `f_col[0]` is set to 0
  - `f_row[0]` is set to 0
  - `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
  - `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is True
  - `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- If `row[j]` is not '#':
  - `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#')
  - `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is False
  - `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `j` is incremented by 1, if `row[j]` is '#': `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), if `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#'), `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0, `exists` is True, `black` is False, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')**
