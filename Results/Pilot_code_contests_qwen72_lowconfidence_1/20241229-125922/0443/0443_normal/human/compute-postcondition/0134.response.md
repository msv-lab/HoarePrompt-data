The code snippet provided updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value. If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is updated to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `j` is greater than 0 and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the `dsu` contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is the input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#'
- `f_col[2]` is 0 (if `f_col[2]` was -1)

The code:
```
f_row[j] = f_row[j] if f_row[j] != -1 else i
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Check the current value of `f_row[j]`.
2. If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.
3. If `f_row[j]` is `-1`, it is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2.

Since `j` is 0, we need to check the value of `f_row[0]`. Given the initial state, `f_row[0]` could be `-1` or some other value. If `f_row[0]` is `-1`, it will be updated to 2. If it is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.

Output State:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` is greater than 0 and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the `dsu` contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where `f_row[0]` is 2 if it was -1, otherwise it remains the same, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is the input string, `j` is 0, the character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#', `f_col[2]` is 0 (if `f_col[2]` was -1)**
