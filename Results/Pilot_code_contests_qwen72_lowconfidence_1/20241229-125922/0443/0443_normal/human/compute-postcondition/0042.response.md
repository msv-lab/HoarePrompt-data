The code snippet `f_col[i] = j` updates the value of `f_col[i]` to `j`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, this means `f_col[0]` will be set to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**
