The code `rows.discard(j)` removes the element `j` from the set `rows` if it exists. If `j` is not in `rows`, the set remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `f_row[j]` is `i`
- `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`
- `f_col[i]` is `j`
- `cols` does not contain `i`

After executing the code:
- The set `rows` no longer contains `j` if it was present.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f_row[j]` is `i`, `exists` is `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, `cols` does not contain `i`, `rows` does not contain `j` if it was present**.
