The code `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation between two indices in the `dsu` object. The indices are `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. This operation modifies the internal state of the `dsu` object, but does not change the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, `n`, `f_col`, `f_row`, `cols`, `rows`, `exists`, `black`, `white`, or `prev_row`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `j` is incremented by 1
- If `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#':
  - `f_col[0]` is set to 0
  - `f_row[0]` is set to 0
  - `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
  - `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is True
  - `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- If `row[j]` is not '#':
  - `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#')
  - `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0
  - `exists` is True
  - `black` is False
  - `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
  - `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')

The union operation modifies the `dsu` object but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and has performed a union between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1. If `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#': `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'). If `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#'), `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0, `exists` is True, `black` is False, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')**
