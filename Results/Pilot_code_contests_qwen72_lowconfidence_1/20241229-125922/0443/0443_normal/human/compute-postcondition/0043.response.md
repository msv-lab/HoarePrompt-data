The code snippet `f_row[j] = i` updates the value of `f_row[j]` to `i`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 1
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

After executing the code snippet `f_row[j] = i`, the value of `f_row[1]` is updated to 0 (since `i` is 0).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with `f_row[0]` set to -1, `f_row[1]` set to 0, and the rest set to -1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**
