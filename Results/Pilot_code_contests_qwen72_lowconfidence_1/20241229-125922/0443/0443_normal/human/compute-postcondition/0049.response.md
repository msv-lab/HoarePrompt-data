The provided Python code snippet calls the `union` method on the `dsu` object, which is a `DisjointSetUnion` object. This method typically merges two sets identified by the given indices. Here, the indices are `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `j` is incremented by 1
- if `row[j]` is '#': `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row[0]` is set to 0
- `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- if `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#')
- `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0
- `exists` is True
- `black` is False
- `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
- `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')

After executing the code:
- The `union` method is called on `dsu` with the indices `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`.
- Since `i` is 0, the first index `i * m + j` simplifies to `j`.
- The second index `(i - 1) * m + j` simplifies to `-m + j`, which is an invalid index because it is negative (since `i` is 0 and `j` is non-negative).

Thus, the `union` method will likely raise an error or have no effect because one of the indices is invalid. However, assuming the method does not raise an error and simply does nothing, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `j` is incremented by 1, if `row[j]` is '#': `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), if `row[j]` is not '#': `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#'), `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0, `exists` is True, `black` is False, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.')**
