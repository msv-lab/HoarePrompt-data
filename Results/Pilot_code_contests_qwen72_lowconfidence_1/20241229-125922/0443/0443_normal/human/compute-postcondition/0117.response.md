The code snippet `rows.discard(j)` removes the value of `j` from the set `rows` if `j` is present in `rows`.

Given that `j` is 2, and `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, excluding 1 (since `rows` does not contain 1), the impact of this operation is:

- `rows` will no longer contain the value 2, assuming it was present before.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, and `f_row[2]` is 1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` except 1, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` except 1 and 2, `f_col[1]` is 2, `f_row[0]` is 1, `exists` is True if `f_col[1]` is 2, 1, or 3, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `exists` remains unchanged, `f_row[2]` is 1.**
