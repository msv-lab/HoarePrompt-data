To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the changes that occur at the end of each iteration:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < m`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - **Character at `row[j]`**: The character at the new index `j` in `row` will be checked.
   - **`f_col` and `f_row`**: These lists may be updated based on the new character at `row[j]`.
   - **`cols` and `rows`**: These sets may be modified based on the new character at `row[j]`.
   - **`black` and `white`**: These variables will be updated based on the new character at `row[j]`.

### Updated State:
- `n` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 (unchanged)
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` (unchanged)
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 (may change)
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 (may change)
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` (may change)
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` (may change)
- `exists` is True (unchanged)
- `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True (will change based on the new character at `row[j]`)
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1 (will change based on the new character at `row[j]`)
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.') (unchanged)
- `row` is an input string (unchanged)
- `j` is 1 (incremented by 1)
- The character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#' (new character)

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is False if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**
