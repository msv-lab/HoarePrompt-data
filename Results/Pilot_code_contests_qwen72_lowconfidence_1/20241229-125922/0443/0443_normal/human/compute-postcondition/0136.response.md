The line of code `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` modifies the variable `exists` by performing a bitwise AND operation between its current value and the result of the comparison `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. This means that if the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` evaluates to `True` (which is equivalent to `1` in a bitwise context), `exists` remains unchanged if it was already `True`, or it becomes `False` if it was `False`. If the condition evaluates to `False` (equivalent to `0`), `exists` will become `False`.

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `exists`, `f_row`, `j`, and `i`, we can only describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`exists` is now `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`**
