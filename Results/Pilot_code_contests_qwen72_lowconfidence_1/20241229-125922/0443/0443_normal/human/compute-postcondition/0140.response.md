The value `j` is discarded from the set `rows`. This operation does not affect the values of `exists`, `f_col[i]`, `f_row[j]`, or `cols`. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`exists` is now `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, `f_row[j]` is `i`, `i` is removed from `cols`, `rows` no longer contains `j`**
