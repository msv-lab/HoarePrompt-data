The code snippet updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value and the value of `i`. If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged. If `f_row[j]` is `-1`, it is set to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2 if `f_col[1]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string
- `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2

The specific changes due to the code snippet:
- If `f_row[j]` is `-1`, it is updated to `1` (the value of `i`).
- If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.

Since `j` is 2, we need to check the value of `f_row[2]`:
- If `f_row[2]` is `-1`, it will be updated to `1`.
- If `f_row[2]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, and `f_col[1]` is 2 if `f_col[1]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, and `f_row[2]` is 1 if `f_row[2]` was initially -1, otherwise it remains unchanged
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string
- `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2
