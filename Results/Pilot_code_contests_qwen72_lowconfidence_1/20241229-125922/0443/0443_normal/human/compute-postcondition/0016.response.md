Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)` from the previous iteration. If `at_start` is False, `file` is further advanced by the length of `sep`, `sep` remains unchanged, and `x` is the next element in `args`.***
