Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `j` is greater than 0 and the characters at index `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the sets containing the elements at indices 0 and -1 in `dsu` are united. `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is False, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` in `row` is not '#'.***
