To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 2 (since it is incremented by 1 in the loop).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `dsu`, `f_col`, `f_row`, `cols`, `rows`, `exists`, `black`, `white`, `prev_row`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop increment.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. After the loop finishes executing, if any cell in `row` is '#', `dsu` will contain unions between adjacent cells that are '#' horizontally or vertically. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False. `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. `prev_row` is equal to `row`.**
