The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a grid from standard input, where the grid is defined by the dimensions `n` and `m` (both integers representing the number of rows and columns, respectively, with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). Each row in the grid is represented by a string of characters, where "#" denotes a black cell and "." denotes a white cell.

The function processes this grid and returns the result of the processing. Since the specific output is not detailed in the provided information, we cannot specify exactly what the function returns. However, based on common patterns in such functions, it might return some form of analysis or transformation of the grid, such as the count of black cells, the pattern of cells, or any other derived information.
