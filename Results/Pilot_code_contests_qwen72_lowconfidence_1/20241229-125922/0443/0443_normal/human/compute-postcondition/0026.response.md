The value of `f_row[j]` is updated to `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, so `f_row[0]` is updated from 0 to 0. This does not change the value of `f_row[0]` because it was already 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` is greater than 0 and the characters at index `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the sets containing the elements at indices 0 and -1 in `dsu` are united, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with `f_row[0]` set to 0 and all other elements set to -1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, and the character at index `j` in `row` is '#'.
