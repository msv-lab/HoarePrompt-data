To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

Code Snippet:
```python
exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Evaluate `f_col[i]`**: Since `i` is 0, we are looking at `f_col[0]`.
   - If `row[j]` (where `j` is 1) is '#', `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1.
   - If `row[j]` is not '#', `f_col[0]` is -1.

2. **Calculate `abs(f_col[i] - j)`**:
   - If `f_col[0]` is 0, `abs(0 - 1) = 1`.
   - If `f_col[0]` is 1, `abs(1 - 1) = 0`.
   - If `f_col[0]` is -1, `abs(-1 - 1) = 2`.

3. **Check the condition `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2`**:
   - If `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, the condition is true (`1 < 2` and `0 < 2`).
   - If `f_col[0]` is -1, the condition is false (`2 < 2`).

4. **Update `exists`**:
   - If `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, `exists` remains True.
   - If `f_col[0]` is -1, `exists` becomes False.

Output State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'
