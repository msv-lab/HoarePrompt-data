The code snippet `f_col[i] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the element in the list `f_col` at index `i`.

Given the Initial State:
- The value of `exists` is updated based on the evaluation of the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.
- The `&=` operator performs a bitwise AND operation between the current value of `exists` and the result of the condition.
- If the condition evaluates to `True`, `exists` remains unchanged; if the condition evaluates to `False`, `exists` becomes `False`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `f_col[i]` is set to `j`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The value of `exists` is updated to `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
