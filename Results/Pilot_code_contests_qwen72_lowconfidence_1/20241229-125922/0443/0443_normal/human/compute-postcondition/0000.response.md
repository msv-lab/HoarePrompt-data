The provided code snippet is a docstring comment that describes the functionality of a print function. It does not actually execute any operations on the variables `args` or `kwargs`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple of values of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args, 'file' is a file-like object to which the output is written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.**
