The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. This operation advances the file pointer by the length of `str(x)`.

Given the initial state:
- `at_start` is False
- `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)` from the previous iteration
- If `at_start` is False, `file` is further advanced by the length of `sep`
- `sep` remains unchanged
- `x` is the next element in `args`

After executing `file.write(str(x))`:
- The file pointer in `file` is further advanced by the length of `str(x)`
- The value of `x` is written to the file, but `x` itself is not modified
- `at_start` remains False
- `sep` remains unchanged
- `args` is not modified

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)` from the previous iteration plus the length of `str(x)`, `sep` remains unchanged, and `x` is the next element in `args`.**
