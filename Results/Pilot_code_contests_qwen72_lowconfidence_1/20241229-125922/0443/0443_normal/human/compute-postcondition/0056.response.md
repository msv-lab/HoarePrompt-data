The given code snippet is:

```python
exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
   - `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[0]` remains unchanged
   - `f_row[0]` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `f_row[0]` is 0
   - `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `cols` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`
   - `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `rows` contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`
   - `exists` is True
   - `black` is True
   - `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
   - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` is evaluated.
   - Since `i` is 0, `f_col[i]` is `f_col[0]`.
   - `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - The condition `abs(f_col[0] - j) < 2` checks if the absolute difference between `f_col[0]` and `j` is less than 2.
   - If the condition is true, `exists` remains True.
   - If the condition is false, `exists` becomes False.

3. **Output State:**
   - The value of `exists` is updated based on the evaluation of the condition `abs(f_col[0] - j) < 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[0]` remains unchanged, `f_row[0]` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `f_row[0]` is 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `cols` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `rows` contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`, `exists` is `True and (abs(f_col[0] - j) < 2)`, `black` is True, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')**
