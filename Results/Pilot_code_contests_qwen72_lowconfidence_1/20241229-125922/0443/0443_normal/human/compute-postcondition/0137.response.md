The code snippet `f_col[i] = j` assigns the value of `j` to the element in the list `f_col` at index `i`.

Given the Initial State: `exists` is now `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`,

- The value of `exists` remains unchanged.
- The value of `f_col[i]` is updated to `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`exists` is now `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is `j`**.
