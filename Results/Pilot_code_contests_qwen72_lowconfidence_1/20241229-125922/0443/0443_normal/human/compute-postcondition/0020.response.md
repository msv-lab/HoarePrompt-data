The line of code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` will write the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary to the file specified by `file`. If `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to writing a newline character (`'\n'`). Additionally, the key `'end'` is removed from the `kwargs` dictionary.

- `file` writes the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` if `'end'` does not exist in `kwargs`.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the key 'flush' (but not 'end' or 'file'), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `True`, and the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. The value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'` has been written to `file`.**
