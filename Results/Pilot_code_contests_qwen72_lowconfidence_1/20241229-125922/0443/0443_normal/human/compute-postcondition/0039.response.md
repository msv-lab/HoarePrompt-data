The code snippet updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value. If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it is set to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Check the value of `f_row[j]`:
   - If `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.
   - If `f_row[j]` is `-1`, it is set to `i`.

Since `j` is 1, we need to check the value of `f_row[1]`:
- If `f_row[1]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.
- If `f_row[1]` is `-1`, it is set to `i` (which is 0).

Therefore, the updated value of `f_row[1]` will be:
- If `f_row[1]` was already not `-1`, it remains the same.
- If `f_row[1]` was `-1`, it is now 0.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'.**
