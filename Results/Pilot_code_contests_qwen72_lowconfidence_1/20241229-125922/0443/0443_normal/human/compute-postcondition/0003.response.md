To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `args` is not an empty tuple. If `args` is empty, the loop will not run even once.
2. **Initial State of `x`**: Before the loop starts, `x` is not defined because it is the loop variable that will take on the values from `args` during each iteration.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they should be mentioned in the state to provide a complete picture.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, `args` must be a non-empty tuple. The other variables remain as they are, but we need to clarify the initial state of `x`.

State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must be non-empty, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `at_start` is `True`, `x` is not defined yet**.
