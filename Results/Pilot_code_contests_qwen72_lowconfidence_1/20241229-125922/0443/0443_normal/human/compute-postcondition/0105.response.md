The provided code snippet performs a union operation using the `dsu` object. Specifically, it unites the elements located at indices `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j` within the `dsu` structure.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string
- `j` is 2
- `m` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet:
- `dsu` now contains a union between the elements `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the indices being united are:
- `i * m + j` = `1 * m + 2` = `m + 2`
- `(i - 1) * m + j` = `(1 - 1) * m + 2` = `0 * m + 2` = `2`

Thus, the `dsu` object now contains a union between the elements `m + 2` and `2`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains a union between elements `m + 2` and `2`. If `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`. `f_col[1]` is 1 if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#'; otherwise, `f_col[1]` is 0. `f_row[0]` is 1, and if `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `f_row[1]` is 1. `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`. If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1. `prev_row` is equal to `row`, and `row` is an input string. `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2.**
