Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a grid from standard input, where the grid is defined by dimensions `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and each cell is represented by a character "#" (black) or "." (white). It processes the grid to identify connected components of black cells ("#") using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. The function also checks several conditions to determine if the grid meets specific criteria:

1. All black cells ("#") are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column.
2. There is at least one black cell in the grid.
3. All rows and columns contain at least one black cell.

If these conditions are met, the function calls `func_2` with the number of connected components of black cells minus the number of white cells. If any of these conditions are not met, `func_2` is called with `-1`.

After the function executes:
- `n` and `m` remain the dimensions of the grid.
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m` and contains unions between adjacent black cells.
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in the corresponding row that had a black cell.
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in the corresponding column that had a black cell.
- `cols` is a set containing all row indices that did not have a black cell.
- `rows` is a set containing all column indices that did not have a black cell.
- `exists` is `True` if all black cells are adjacent to another black cell in the same row or column, otherwise `False`.
- `black` is `True` if there is at least one black cell in the grid, otherwise `False`.
- `white` is the total number of white cells in the grid.
- `prev_row` is the last row read from the input.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the grid is entirely white (no black cells), the function will still correctly call `func_2(-1)`.
- If the grid is entirely black, the function will call `func_2(1)` since there is only one connected component of black cells.
- The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer dimensions or invalid characters in the grid), which could lead to runtime errors. **
