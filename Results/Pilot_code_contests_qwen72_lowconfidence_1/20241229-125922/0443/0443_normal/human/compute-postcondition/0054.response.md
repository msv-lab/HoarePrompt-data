The given Python code snippet updates the value of `f_col[i]` based on its current value and the value of `j`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
- If `j` is such that `row[j]` is '#' and `row[j - 1]` is '#', `dsu` performs a union between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, and `j` is incremented by 1.
- If `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#':
  - `f_col[0]` is set to 0.
  - `f_row[0]` is set to 0.
  - `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`.
  - `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`.
  - `exists` is True.
  - `black` is True.
  - `white` is 0.
  - `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.').
- If `row[j]` is not '#':
  - `f_col` and `f_row` remain unchanged (all elements set to -1 except `f_col[0]` and `f_row[0]` if `row[j]` is '#').
  - `cols` and `rows` contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` and 0 to `m-1` respectively, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case they exclude 0.
  - `exists` is True.
  - `black` is True.
  - `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0.
  - `prev_row` remains a string of `m` periods ('.').

### Code Snippet:
```python
f_col[i] = f_col[i] if f_col[i] != -1 else j
```

### Impact of the Code:
- The code checks if `f_col[i]` is not equal to -1.
- If `f_col[i]` is not -1, it remains unchanged.
- If `f_col[i]` is -1, it is updated to the value of `j`.

### Calculation:
- Given `i` is 0, the code checks `f_col[0]`.
- If `f_col[0]` is not -1, it remains the same.
- If `f_col[0]` is -1, it is updated to the value of `j`.

### Output State:
- If `f_col[0]` was already set to a value other than -1, it remains unchanged.
- If `f_col[0]` was -1, it is now set to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[0]` remains unchanged, `f_row[0]` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `f_row[0]` is -1, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `cols` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `rows` contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.').**
