The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) object `dsu` for the elements at positions `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- **`dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)`**: This operation connects the two elements in the DSU structure. The elements being connected are at positions `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. This means that these two positions are now considered part of the same connected component in the DSU.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically:

- `n` is still greater than 1.
- `i` is still 2.
- `m` is still an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0.
- `dsu` is still a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
- The condition for performing the union operation when `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' remains unchanged.
- `j` is still `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`.
- `f_col` is still a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row.
- `f_row` is still a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column.
- `cols` is still a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`.
- `rows` is still a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`.
- `exists` is still True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False.
- `black` is still True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False.
- `white` is still the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged.
- If `row[j]` is '#', `j` is still discarded from the set `rows`, `exists` is still updated to `exists & (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`, `f_col[i]` is still set to `j`, `f_row[j]` is still set to `i`, and `i` is still removed from `cols`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` performs the union of `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False. `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged. `dsu` has performed the union of `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.**
