The code snippet `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` updates the value of `exists` based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `f_row[1]` is 1.
   - `exists` is True.

2. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - Calculate `f_row[j] - i`: Since `j` is 1, `f_row[j]` is 1. Therefore, `f_row[j] - i` is `1 - 1 = 0`.
   - Calculate `abs(f_row[j] - i)`: The absolute value of 0 is 0.
   - Check the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`: Since 0 is less than 2, the condition is True.

3. **Update `exists`**:
   - `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` is equivalent to `exists = exists and (abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2)`.
   - Since `exists` is True and the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` is also True, `exists` remains True.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` and `row[j]` are both '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, `f_row[1]` is 1, `cols` excludes 1, `rows` excludes 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, if `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, and `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, `f_col[1]` is 0**.
