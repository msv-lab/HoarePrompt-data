The value of `black` is set to `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`. If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` performs the union of `i * m + j` and `(i - 1) * m + j`. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`. `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row. `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column. `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`. `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`. `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False. `black` is True. `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged. If `j` and `row[j] == row[j - 1] == '#'`, `dsu` performs the union of `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`. Otherwise, no additional union operation is performed on `dsu`.**
