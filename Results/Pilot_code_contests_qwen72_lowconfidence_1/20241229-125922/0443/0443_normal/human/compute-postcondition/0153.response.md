The provided code snippet updates the `exists` variable based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
   - `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable).
   - `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`.
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row.
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column.
   - `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise `f_row[j]` remains unchanged.
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`.
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`.
   - `exists` is updated to `exists & (abs(f_col[2] - j) < 2)`.
   - `black` is True.
   - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged.
   - `f_col[2]` is `j` if `f_col[2]` was `-1`; otherwise, `f_col[2]` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` updates the `exists` variable.
   - `exists` is updated to the logical AND of its current value and the result of the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `exists` is updated based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `k + 1`.
   - `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - The condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` evaluates to `True` if `f_row[j]` is 2 (since `abs(2 - 2) == 0` which is less than 2).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise `f_row[j]` remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is updated to `exists & True`, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` remains unchanged, `f_col[2]` is `j` if `f_col[2]` was `-1`; otherwise, `f_col[2]` remains unchanged**.
