The given code snippet updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value. Specifically, if `f_row[j]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it is set to the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`
- If `j` and `row[j] == row[j - 1] == '#'`, `dsu` performs a union operation between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`
- `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable)
- `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`
- `exists` is updated to `exists & True`
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#'
- `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'` and `f_col[2]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[2]` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- If `f_row[j]` was `-1`, it is now set to `2` (the value of `i`).
- If `f_row[j]` was not `-1`, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j] == prev_row[j] == '#'`, `dsu` has performed the union operation between `2 * m + (k + 2)` and `m + k + 2`, if `j` and `row[j] == row[j - 1] == '#'`, `dsu` performs a union operation between `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`, `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#' (if applicable), `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, and `m` must be greater than `k + 2`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row` excluding 2, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row` excluding `j` if `row[j] == '#'`, `exists` is updated to `exists & True`, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 2 if `row[j]` is not '#' and `row[j-1]` is '.', otherwise `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1 if `row[j]` is not '#`, `f_col[2]` is `j` if `row[j] == '#'` and `f_col[2]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[2]` remains unchanged, `f_row[j]` is 2 if `f_row[j]` was -1, otherwise `f_row[j]` remains unchanged**
