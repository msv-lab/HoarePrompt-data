The given code snippet updates the value of `f_col[i]` based on its current value and the value of `j`. Specifically, if `f_col[i]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is set to the value of `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `j` is greater than 0 and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the `dsu` contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is the input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#'

Now, let's evaluate the code:

```python
f_col[i] = f_col[i] if f_col[i] != -1 else j
```

Since `i` is 2, we need to check the value of `f_col[2]`:
- If `f_col[2]` is not `-1`, it remains unchanged.
- If `f_col[2]` is `-1`, it is set to `j`.

Given that `j` is 0, if `f_col[2]` is `-1`, it will be updated to 0.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `j` is greater than 0 and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the `dsu` contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is the input string
- `j` is 0
- The character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#'
- `f_col[2]` is 0 (if `f_col[2]` was -1)

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` is greater than 0 and the character at position `j` and `j-1` in `row` are both '#', then the `dsu` contains the union of the sets at indices `2 * m` and `2 * m - 1`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is the input string, `j` is 0, the character at position `j` in both `row` and `prev_row` is '#', `f_col[2]` is 0 (if `f_col[2]` was -1)**
