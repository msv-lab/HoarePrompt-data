The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of the variable `sep` to the file object `file`. This operation does not change the value of `sep` or `file` itself, but it does affect the state of the file, advancing the file pointer by the length of `sep`.

Output State: **`file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep`, `sep` remains unchanged.**
