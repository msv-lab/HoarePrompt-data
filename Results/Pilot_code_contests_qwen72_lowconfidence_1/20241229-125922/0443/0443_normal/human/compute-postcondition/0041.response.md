The code snippet `exists &= abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` updates the value of `exists` based on the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False
- `black` is True
- `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1
- The character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `j` is 1.
3. `f_row` is a list where `f_row[0]` and `f_row[1]` are set to 0 if `row[j]` is '#'.
4. The condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` needs to be evaluated:
   - If `row[j]` is '#', then `f_row[1]` is 0.
   - Therefore, `abs(f_row[1] - i) = abs(0 - 0) = 0`.
   - Since 0 is less than 2, the condition `abs(f_row[j] - i) < 2` is True.
5. `exists` is updated using the logical AND operator:
   - If `exists` was True before, it remains True because `True & True = True`.
   - If `exists` was False before, it remains False because `False & True = False`.

Thus, the value of `exists` does not change if `row[j]` is '#'. If `row[j]` is not '#', `f_row[1]` is -1, and the condition `abs(-1 - 0) < 2` is also True (since 1 < 2). Therefore, `exists` remains unchanged in both cases.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_col[0]` is set to 0 or 1 depending on whether `row[1]` is '#' or not, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with all elements set to -1, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case `f_row[0]` is set to 0 and `f_row[1]` is set to 0, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**.
