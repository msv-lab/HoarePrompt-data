The code snippet `exists &= abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` updates the value of `exists` based on the condition `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
   - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`.
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row.
   - `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column.
   - `f_row[0]` is 1 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`.
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`.
   - `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False.
   - `black` is True.
   - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`.
   - `prev_row` is equal to `row`.
   - `row` is an input string.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `row[j]` is '#'.

2. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `f_col[1]` is 0 (since it was updated from -1 to 0 if it was -1).
   - The condition `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` becomes `abs(0 - 0) < 2`, which simplifies to `0 < 2`, which is True.

3. **Update `exists`**:
   - `exists` is initially True.
   - Since the condition `abs(f_col[i] - j) < 2` is True, `exists` remains True.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_col[1]` is 0 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `f_row[0]` is 1 if it was -1, otherwise it remains unchanged, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 0, `row[j]` is '#'**.
