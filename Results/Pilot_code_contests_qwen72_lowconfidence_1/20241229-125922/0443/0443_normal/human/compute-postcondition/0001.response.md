The code snippet modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `'sep'` and `'file'`, assigning their values (or default values) to the variables `sep` and `file` respectively. The specific changes are:

- `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise it is assigned the default value `' '`.
- `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise it is assigned the default value `sys.stdout`.

The rest of the `kwargs` dictionary remains unchanged, and the other preconditions (`args` being a tuple of values of any type, and `kwargs` being a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush') remain valid.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, and `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'.**
