The code `rows.discard(j)` removes the element `j` (which is 1) from the set `rows`. Since `rows` initially contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except if `row[j]` is '#', in which case it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, the removal of `j` (1) from `rows` means that `rows` will no longer contain the integer 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` with `f_col[0]` set to 1, `f_row` is a list of length `m` with `f_row[0]` set to -1, `f_row[1]` set to 0, and the rest set to -1, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `cols` is a set containing all integers from 1 to `n-1`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1`, except 1, and if `row[j]` is '#', it contains all integers from 1 to `m-1`, except 1, `exists` is True if `f_col[0]` is 0 or 1, otherwise `exists` is False, `black` is True, `white` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#', otherwise `white` is 1, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.'), `row` is an input string, `j` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `row` is either '#' or not '#'**
