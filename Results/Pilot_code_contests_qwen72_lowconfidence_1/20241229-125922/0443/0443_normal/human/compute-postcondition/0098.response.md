The code snippet `f_col[i] = j` updates the value of `f_col[i]` to `j`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `j` and `row[j]` are both '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `f_col[1]` is 0
- `f_row[0]` is 1
- `f_row[1]` is 1
- `cols` excludes 1
- `rows` excludes 0 and 1
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- If `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1
- `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 1
- `f_col[1]` is 0

After executing `f_col[i] = j`, the value of `f_col[1]` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, if `j` and `row[j]` are both '#' and `row[j - 1]` is also '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `f_col[1]` is 1, `f_row[0]` is 1, `f_row[1]` is 1, `cols` excludes 1, `rows` excludes 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, if `row[j]` is not '#' or `row[j - 1]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, `j` is 1**
