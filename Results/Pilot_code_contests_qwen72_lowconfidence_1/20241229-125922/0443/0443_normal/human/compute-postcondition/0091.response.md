The provided Python code snippet performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) object `dsu` between the elements `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Review:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
   - `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`.
   - If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `1` and also a union between elements `m` and `0`.
   - `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row.
   - `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column.
   - `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`.
   - `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`.
   - If `row[j]` is '#':
     - `f_col[1]` is 0.
     - `f_row[0]` is 1.
     - `cols` excludes 1.
     - `rows` excludes 0 and 1.
     - `exists` is True.
     - `black` is True.
     - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`.
   - If `row[j]` is not '#':
     - `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1.
     - `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states.
   - `prev_row` is equal to `row`.
   - `row` is an input string.
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation between the elements `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1`.
   - Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the elements being unioned are `1 * m + 1` and `1 * m + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `m + 1` and `m`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - The union operation between `m + 1` and `m` is performed in the `dsu` object.
   - No other variables are affected by this operation.

### Output State:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `dsu` contains a union between elements `m + 1` and `m`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, if `row[j]` is '#', `f_col[1]` is 0, `f_row[0]` is 1, `cols` excludes 1, `rows` excludes 0 and 1, `exists` is True, `black` is True, and `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, if `row[j]` is not '#', `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row` plus 1, and `exists`, `black`, `cols`, and `rows` retain their previous states, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, and `j` is 1.**
