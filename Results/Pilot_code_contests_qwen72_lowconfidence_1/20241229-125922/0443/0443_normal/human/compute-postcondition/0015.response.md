The code `file.write(sep)` writes the string `sep` to the file object `file`. The file pointer is advanced by the length of `sep`. The variables `at_start`, `sep`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`at_start` is False, `file` is a file object with the file pointer advanced by the length of `sep` plus the length of `str(x)` from the previous iteration and now additionally by the length of `sep`, `sep` remains unchanged, `x` is the next element in `args`**
