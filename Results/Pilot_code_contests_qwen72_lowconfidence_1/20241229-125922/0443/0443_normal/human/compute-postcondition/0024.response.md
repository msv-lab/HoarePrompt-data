The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `args` and `kwargs`. `args` is a tuple containing values of any type, and `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The key 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in `args`, 'file' is a file-like object to which the output is written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.

The function does not return any value; it performs operations based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `args` and a dictionary `kwargs`. It writes the values from `args` to the specified `file`, separated by the string `sep`, and appends the string `end` after the last value. If `flush` is True, it forcibly flushes the stream. The function does not return any value.**
