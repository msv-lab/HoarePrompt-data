The code snippet `f_row[j] = f_row[j] if f_row[j] != -1 else i` updates the value of `f_row[j]` based on its current value and the value of `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[0]` remains unchanged
- `f_row[0]` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `f_row[0]` is -1
- `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `cols` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`
- `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `rows` contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`
- `exists` is True
- `black` is True
- `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0
- `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Check the current value of `f_row[j]`.
2. If `f_row[j]` is not -1, it remains unchanged.
3. If `f_row[j]` is -1, it is updated to the value of `i`, which is 0.

Since `i` is 0, if `f_row[j]` was -1, it will now be set to 0. If `f_row[j]` was already 0 (or any other value), it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `f_col[0]` is `j` if `f_col[0]` was -1, otherwise `f_col[0]` remains unchanged, `f_row[0]` is 0 if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `f_row[0]` is 0, `cols` contains all integers from 1 to `n-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `cols` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, `rows` contains all integers from 1 to `m-1` if `row[j]` is '#' and `prev_row[j]` is '#', otherwise `rows` contains all integers from 0 to `m-1`, `exists` is True, `black` is True, `white` is 1 if `row[j]` is not '#', otherwise `white` is 0, `prev_row` is a string of `m` periods ('.')**
