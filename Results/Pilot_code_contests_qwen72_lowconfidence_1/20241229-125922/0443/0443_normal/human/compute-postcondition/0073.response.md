The code snippet `dsu.union(i * m + j, i * m + j - 1)` performs a union operation on the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. Specifically, it unites the elements at positions `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1` in the DSU.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`
- If `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` now contains a union between elements `m` and `0`
- `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row
- `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column
- `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`
- `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`
- `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False
- `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False
- `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`
- `prev_row` is equal to `row`
- `row` is an input string
- `j` is 0
- Additionally, `j` is greater than 0, and `row[j]` and `row[j - 1]` are both '#' characters

The impact of the code is:
- The elements `i * m + j` and `i * m + j - 1` are united in the `dsu` object.

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than 0, the specific positions being united are `1 * m + j` and `1 * m + j - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `dsu` is a `DisjointSetUnion` object initialized with size `n * m`, `dsu` now contains a union between elements `1 * m + j` and `1 * m + j - 1`, if `row[j]` and `prev_row[j]` are both '#', `dsu` also contains a union between elements `m` and `0`, `f_col` is a list of length `n` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last column in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding row, `f_row` is a list of length `m` where each element is either -1 or the index of the last row in `row` that had a '#' for the corresponding column, `cols` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding column of `row`, `rows` is a set containing all integers from 0 to `m-1` that did not have a '#' in the corresponding row of `row`, `exists` is True if all '#' characters in `row` are adjacent to another '#' character in the same row or column, otherwise it is False, `black` is True if there is at least one '#' character in `row`, otherwise it is False, `white` is the number of '.' characters in `row`, `prev_row` is equal to `row`, `row` is an input string, and `j` is greater than 0, and `row[j]` and `row[j - 1]` are both '#' characters.**
