The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, this would raise a `NameError`.

However, considering the initial state provided and assuming `x` should be a part of the `args` tuple (since `args` is non-empty), let's proceed under the assumption that `x` is the first element of `args`:

- `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of the first element of `args` to `file`.
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type and must be non-empty, so `x` is now the first element of `args`.
- The value of `sep` remains the same, which is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise.
- `file` remains the same, which is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file'.
- `at_start` is `True`, and since `file.write(str(x))` has been executed, the value of `sep` has not been written to `file` yet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of values of any type and must be non-empty, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` otherwise, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` otherwise, `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file', `at_start` is `True`, `x` is the first element of `args`, and the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
