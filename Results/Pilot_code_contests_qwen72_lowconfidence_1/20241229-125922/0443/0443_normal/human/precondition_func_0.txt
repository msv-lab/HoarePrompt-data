No variables are passed to `func_1()`. Inside the function, `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the grid (number of rows and columns, respectively), such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. The function reads the grid from standard input, where each row is represented by a string of characters "#" (black) and "." (white).
