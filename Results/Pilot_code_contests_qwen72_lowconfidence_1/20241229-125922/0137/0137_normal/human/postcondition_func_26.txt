The function `func_26` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist contains `m` elements, all of which are the value `v`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. If `m` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` empty sublists. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not have any side effects.
