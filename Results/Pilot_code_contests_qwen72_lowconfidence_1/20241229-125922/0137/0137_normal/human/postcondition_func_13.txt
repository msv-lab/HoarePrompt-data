The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters and invokes another function `func_1` with the string 'No' as an argument. After the function `func_13` completes its execution, `func_1` has been called with the argument 'No', but the specific effects of `func_1` on the program state are not defined within `func_13`. Since `func_13` does not return any value, the final state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effects caused by `func_1` (if any).
