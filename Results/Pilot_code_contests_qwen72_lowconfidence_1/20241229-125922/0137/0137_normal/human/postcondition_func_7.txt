The function `func_7` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list up to that point. Specifically, the i-th element in the returned list is the sum of the first i+1 elements of the input list `ar`. If the input list `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
