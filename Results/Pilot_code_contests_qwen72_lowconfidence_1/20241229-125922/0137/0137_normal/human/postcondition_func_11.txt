The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'NO' as its argument. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to the input parameters `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2`, as these parameters are not used within `func_11`. The overall effect of calling `func_11` is solely dependent on the behavior of `func_1` when called with the argument 'NO'.
