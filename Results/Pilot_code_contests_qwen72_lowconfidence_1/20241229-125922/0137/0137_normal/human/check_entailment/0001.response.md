Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle the movement and switching logic for certain cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the cost of moving from one point to another and the conditions under which the edges are switched is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Activation and Movement Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another by considering the difference in coordinates and the parity of the sum of the current point's coordinates.
   - However, the logic for determining whether an edge is active and how to switch it is not correctly implemented. The program incorrectly assumes that the cost calculation is straightforward and does not account for the complex nature of the edge activation rules.

2. **Flawed Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another. These conditions do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
   - For example, the program incorrectly handles the case where the current point and the next point are in the same row or column, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the test case with points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\). According to the problem description, the edge from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) is activated because \(1 + 1\) is even. Therefore, the cost to move from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) should be 0.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 1 due to its flawed logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases and therefore is incorrect.
