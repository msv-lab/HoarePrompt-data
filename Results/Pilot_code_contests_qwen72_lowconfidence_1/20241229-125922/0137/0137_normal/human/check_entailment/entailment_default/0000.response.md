Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_29` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost path to pass through all points is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Initial Point (1, 1)**: The function appends the point (1, 1) to the list of points and sorts the entire list. This means that (1, 1) could be in the middle of the sorted list, which would incorrectly influence the calculation of the cost.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost of moving between points is not correct. The function uses a combination of `plus1` and `same` to calculate the cost, but it does not correctly account for the rules of movement and edge activation. Specifically, the conditions for determining whether an edge is activated or not are not accurately implemented.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the points are already sorted or if there are very large values, the function might not behave as expected.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Appending (1, 1)**: Appending (1, 1) and sorting the list can place (1, 1) in the middle of the list, which is incorrect. The initial point (1, 1) should be the starting point, and the cost calculation should start from there.

- **Cost Calculation Logic**:
  - The function uses `plus1` and `same` to calculate the cost, but it does not correctly handle the rules for edge activation. For example, if `r + c` is even, the edge to `(r+1, c)` is activated, and if `r + c` is odd, the edge to `(r+1, c+1)` is activated. The function does not correctly account for these rules in its cost calculation.
  - The logic for `o` (whether the current point's sum is even or odd) is not consistently applied throughout the cost calculation.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function does not handle the case where the points are already sorted or contain very large values. This could lead to incorrect cost calculations.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
