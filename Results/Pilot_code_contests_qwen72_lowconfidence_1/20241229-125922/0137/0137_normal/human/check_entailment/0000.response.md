Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a flaw in how it calculates the cost of moving from one point to another. Specifically, the logic used to determine the cost of moving from `(x, y)` to `(nx, ny)` is not entirely correct. The conditions and calculations within the loop do not accurately reflect the rules for moving through the triangle, especially when dealing with the parity of `x + y`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
3
1 4 2
1 3 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Actual Output:
The program will output `0`, which is correct for this case. However, consider another case:

### Input:
```
1
3
1 4 2
1 3 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0
```

### Actual Output:
The program outputs `0`, but let's consider a more complex case:

### Input:
```
1
4
3 10 5 8
2 5 2 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
2
```

### Actual Output:
The program may output a different value because of the flawed logic in the cost calculation.

The issue lies in the way the program handles the movement costs. The conditions and calculations inside the loop are not robust enough to handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
