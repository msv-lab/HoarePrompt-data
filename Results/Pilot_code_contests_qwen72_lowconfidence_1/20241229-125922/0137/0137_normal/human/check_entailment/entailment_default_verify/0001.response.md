Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment identifies several critical issues with the program, which are indeed accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Activation and Movement Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another by considering the difference in coordinates and the parity of the sum of the current point's coordinates. However, this logic is flawed.
   - Specifically, the program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the cost, but these conditions do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements. For example, the program incorrectly handles the case where the current point and the next point are in the same row or column.

2. **Flawed Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the cost of moving from one point to another is incorrect. The conditions used to determine whether an edge is active and how to switch it are not aligned with the problem's edge activation rules.
   - For instance, the program incorrectly assumes that the cost calculation is straightforward and does not account for the complex nature of the edge activation rules. This leads to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the test case with points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\). According to the problem description, the edge from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) is activated because \(1 + 1\) is even. Therefore, the cost to move from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) should be 0.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 1 due to its flawed logic.

4. **Output Hints:**
   - The output hints indicate that the function `func_29` processes a set of distinct points, appends a fixed point `(1, 1)`, sorts the points, and calculates a cumulative result `ans` based on the differences between consecutive points.
   - While the output hints provide a high-level overview of the function's behavior, they do not address the specific issues in the cost calculation logic. The hints do not contradict the original assessment but rather confirm that the program's core logic for cost calculation is incorrect.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the movement and switching logic for certain cases, leading to incorrect cost calculations. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
