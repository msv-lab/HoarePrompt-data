Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key problems:

1. **Handling of Initial Point (1, 1)**:
   - The initial point (1, 1) is appended to the list of points and the list is sorted. However, this can lead to incorrect behavior because the initial point (1, 1) should be the starting point, and the algorithm should consider paths from this point to the other points. Appending it to the list and sorting it might place it in the wrong position, affecting the path calculation.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Path Cost**:
   - The logic for calculating the path cost is flawed. The code attempts to calculate the cost based on the differences between consecutive points, but it does not correctly handle the activation of edges based on the parity of \( r + c \). The conditions for adding to the cost are not aligned with the problem's rules for edge activation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the points are already sorted or where the points are very close to each other. For example, if the points are already in the correct order, the function might still incorrectly calculate the cost.

4. **Algorithmic Complexity**:
   - The current approach sorts the points and then iterates through them, which might not be the most efficient way to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum cost path, which might involve more complex algorithms like dynamic programming or graph traversal techniques.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

### Incorrect Handling of Initial Point (1, 1)
- The initial point (1, 1) is appended to the list of points and the list is sorted. This can lead to the initial point being in the wrong position, which affects the path calculation. The initial point should be the starting point, and the algorithm should consider paths from this point to the other points.

### Incorrect Calculation of Path Cost
- The logic for calculating the path cost is incorrect. The function attempts to calculate the cost based on the differences between consecutive points, but it does not correctly handle the activation of edges based on the parity of \( r + c \). The conditions for adding to the cost are not aligned with the problem's rules for edge activation.

### Edge Cases
- The function does not handle edge cases where the points are already sorted or where the points are very close to each other. For example, if the points are already in the correct order, the function might still incorrectly calculate the cost.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 4 2
1 3 1
```
The expected output is `0`, but the provided code might produce a different result due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
