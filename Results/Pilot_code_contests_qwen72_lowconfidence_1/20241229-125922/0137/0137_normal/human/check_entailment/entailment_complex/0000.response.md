Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_29` does not correctly handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost path is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function appends the point `(1, 1)` to the list of points and sorts the list. However, this approach does not guarantee that the path will be optimal. The problem requires finding the minimum cost path passing through all points in arbitrary order, not necessarily in sorted order.

2. **Flawed Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation logic inside the loop is incorrect. The variables `plus1`, `same`, and `o` are used to calculate the cost, but the logic does not correctly account for the rules of the problem:
     - If `r + c` is even, the edge to the point `(r+1, c)` is activated.
     - If `r + c` is odd, the edge to the point `(r+1, c+1)` is activated.
   - The current logic does not correctly handle the transition between points based on the activation rules.

3. **Incorrect Path Traversal**:
   - The function assumes that the points are traversed in the order they appear after sorting, which is not necessarily the optimal path. The problem requires finding the minimum cost path, which may involve a different traversal order.

4. **Missing Logic for Reversing Edges**:
   - The function does not include logic to reverse edges and calculate the cost of doing so, which is a crucial part of the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following example from the problem description:
- Input: `n = 3`, `r = [1, 4, 2]`, `c = [1, 3, 1]`
- Expected Output: `0`

The current implementation would sort the points to `[ (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 3) ]` and calculate the cost incorrectly. The correct approach would involve finding the optimal path, which in this case is `0` because the points can be reached without reversing any edges.

Given these issues, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
