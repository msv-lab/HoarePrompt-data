### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap
- The problem involves an infinite triangle with layers and points.
- Each point \((r, c)\) has two directed edges to \((r+1, c)\) and \((r+1, c+1)\), but only one is activated based on the parity of \(r + c\).
- The goal is to find the minimum cost path from \((1, 1)\) to visit a sequence of points in any order.
- The cost increases by 1 for each edge replacement and does not increase for moving along an activated edge.

#### Program Structure
- The program reads input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum cost path.
- The main function `func_29` handles the core logic.
- Utility functions like `func_1`, `func_17`, and `func_19` handle input and output.

#### Detailed Function Analysis

1. **func_1**: Handles printing values to a stream.
2. **func_17**: Reads a line from standard input and strips newline characters.
3. **func_19**: Reads a line of space-separated integers.
4. **func_29**: Main function for processing the points and calculating the minimum cost path.
   - Reads the number of points \(n\).
   - Reads the lists \(r\) and \(c\).
   - Appends the starting point \((1, 1)\) to the list of points.
   - Sorts the points.
   - Iterates through the points to calculate the cost of the path.

#### Core Logic in `func_29`
- **Appending the Starting Point**: The starting point \((1, 1)\) is added to the list of points.
- **Sorting Points**: The points are sorted to ensure they are processed in a consistent order.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - For each pair of consecutive points, the function calculates the difference in the y-coordinates (`plus1`) and the difference in the x-coordinates minus `plus1` (`same`).
  - The cost is adjusted based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates of the current point.
  - The cost is incremented by the number of steps required to move between the points, considering the activation of edges.

#### Verification
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input as specified.
- **Path Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost path by considering the activation of edges and the cost of edge replacements.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the addition of the starting point and sorts the points to ensure the correct order of traversal.

#### Conclusion
The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads the input, processes the points, and calculates the minimum cost path correctly. The logic for handling the activation of edges and the cost of edge replacements is implemented correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
