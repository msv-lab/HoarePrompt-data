Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the program, and the annotated version of the code does not address these issues or provide a different perspective that would make the program correct. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Activation and Movement Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another by considering the difference in coordinates and the parity of the sum of the current point's coordinates. However, the logic for determining whether an edge is active and how to switch it is flawed.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the cost calculation is straightforward and does not account for the complex nature of the edge activation rules.

2. **Flawed Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another. These conditions do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
   - For example, the program incorrectly handles the case where the current point and the next point are in the same row or column, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the test case with points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\). According to the problem description, the edge from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) is activated because \(1 + 1\) is even. Therefore, the cost to move from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) should be 0.
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 1 due to its flawed logic.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:

- The annotated code does not provide any additional insights that would correct the issues identified in the original assessment.
- The logic for calculating the cost of moving from one point to another in the `func_29` function remains flawed. Specifically, the conditions for determining the cost based on the parity of the sum of the coordinates and the differences in coordinates are not correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified in the original assessment and the lack of corrections in the annotated version, the program does not meet the problem description and is therefore incorrect. Thus, the final assessment remains **False**.
