Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Activation and Movement Cost Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another by considering the difference in coordinates and the parity of the sum of the current point's coordinates. However, the logic for determining whether an edge is active and how to switch it is not correctly implemented.
   - Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the cost calculation is straightforward and does not account for the complex nature of the edge activation rules. For example, the program does not correctly handle the case where the current point and the next point are in the same row or column, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

2. **Flawed Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to calculate the cost of moving from one point to another. These conditions do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
   - For example, consider the test case with points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\). According to the problem description, the edge from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) is activated because \(1 + 1\) is even. Therefore, the cost to move from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) should be 0. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 1 due to its flawed logic.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Switching:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the switching of edges. The problem description specifies that the edge can be switched, and this action increases the cost of the path by 1. The program's logic for switching edges is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

4. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - For the test case with points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\):
     - The correct cost should be 0 because the edge from \((1, 1)\) to \((2, 2)\) is activated.
     - However, the program calculates the cost as 1, which is incorrect.

5. **Annotation Verification:**
   - The annotated version of the code confirms that the program's logic for calculating the cost of moving from one point to another and the conditions for edge activation and switching are flawed. The annotations show that the program does not correctly handle the edge cases and the complex logic required by the problem description.

Given these issues, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the movement and switching logic for certain cases, leading to incorrect cost calculations. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
