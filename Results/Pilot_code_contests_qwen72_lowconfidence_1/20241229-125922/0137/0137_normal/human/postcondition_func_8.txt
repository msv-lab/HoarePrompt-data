The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar` up to that index, calculated in reverse order and then reversed back to maintain the original order. This means that for each element in the returned list, it represents the sum of all elements from the current position to the end of the list in the original list. If the input list `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If the input list contains a single element, the function returns a list with that same single element.
