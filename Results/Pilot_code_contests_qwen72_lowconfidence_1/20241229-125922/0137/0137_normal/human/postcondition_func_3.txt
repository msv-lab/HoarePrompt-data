The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It iterates `t` times, calling the function `func_29()` in each iteration. The function does not modify the value of `t` and does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `p` (the loop counter) will be equal to `t - 1`. The function does not determine or return whether `t` is odd or even, contrary to the provided return postcondition.
