The given Python code snippet increments the `ans` variable by the value of `same % 2`. To determine the new value of `ans`, we need to consider the current state of `ans` and `same`.

From the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples.
- `x` is `r[2]`.
- `y` is `c[2]`.
- `nx` is `r[3]`.
- `ny` is `c[3]`.
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`.
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`.
- Otherwise, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`.

The code snippet `ans += same % 2` further increments `ans` by the value of `same % 2`.

Let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. The value of `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.
2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `ans + same % 2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `ans + same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, otherwise, `o` is 0, and `ans` is `ans + same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`**
