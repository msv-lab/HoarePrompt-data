The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means no changes are made to the variables in the current iteration, and the state of the variables remains the same as before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `o` is either 1 or 0 based on `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.**
