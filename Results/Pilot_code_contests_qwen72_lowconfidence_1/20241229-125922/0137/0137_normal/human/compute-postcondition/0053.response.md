The code snippet `ans += same % 2` increments the value of `ans` by the result of `same % 2`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
   - `x` is `r[0]`.
   - `y` is `c[0]`.
   - `nx` is `r[1]`.
   - `ny` is `c[1]`.
   - `same` is 0 or a non-zero value.
   - `plus1` is 0.
   - `o` is 0.
   - `ans` is calculated based on the conditions:
     - If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`.
     - If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\).
     - If `same` was not 0 before, `same` is now `same - 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.
   - This operation does not affect any other variables.

3. **Final State**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + same % 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `same` is 0 or a non-zero value, `plus1` is 0, `o` is 0, `ans` is `ans + same % 2`**.
