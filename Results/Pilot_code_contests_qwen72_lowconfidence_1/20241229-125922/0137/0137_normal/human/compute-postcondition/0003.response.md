The code snippet initializes an empty list named `points`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `r`, or `c`, which remain as their respective return values from the functions `func_9()` and `func_19()`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and the new initialization of `points`.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is an empty list**
