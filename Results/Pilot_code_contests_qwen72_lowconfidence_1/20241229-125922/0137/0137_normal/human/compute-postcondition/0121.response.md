Functionality: ** The function `func_29` processes a set of distinct points defined by their coordinates `(r[i], c[i])` where `1 ≤ c[i] ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9`. It appends a fixed point `(1, 1)` to the list of points, sorts the points, and then calculates a cumulative result `ans` based on the differences between consecutive points. The function ultimately calls another function `func_1` with the calculated `ans` as its argument. The function does not return any value directly. The final state of the program includes `n` being incremented by 1, `points` being a sorted list of the original points plus `(1, 1)`, and `ans` being the cumulative result of the loop calculations. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0, leading to `points` initially being an empty list before appending `(1, 1)`, and the behavior when the points are already sorted or contain very large values. **
