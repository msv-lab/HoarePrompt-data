To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the return value of `func_9()`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_19()`.
- `c` is the return value of `func_19()`.
- `points` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    points.append((r[i], c[i]))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the return value of `func_9()`.
   - For each iteration `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), the tuple `(r[i], c[i])` is appended to the list `points`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times.
   - After `n` iterations, `points` will contain `n` tuples, each of the form `(r[i], c[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `points` will remain an empty list.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is the return value of `func_9()`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_19()`.
- `c` is the return value of `func_19()`.
- `points` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is `(r[i], c[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `points` will be an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is a list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-1], c[n-1])]` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `points` is an empty list.**
