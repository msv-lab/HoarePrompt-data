The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\), `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`, `o` is 0, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
