The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` was the return value of `func_9()`. The states of the other variables (`r`, `c`, `points`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Since `n` is now one more than its original value, the condition for constructing the `points` list remains the same, as the original `n` was already used to determine the structure of `points`.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()` + 1, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]` if the original `n` was greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`, `ans` is 0**
