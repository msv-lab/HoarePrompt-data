To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions and changes that occur at the start of each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[0]`
- `y` is `c[0]`
- `nx` is `r[1]`
- `ny` is `c[1]`
- `same` is 0
- `plus1` is 0
- `o` is 1 if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0
- `ans` is calculated based on the value of `o` and `same`

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, so `i < n - 1` is true.

2. **Increment `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.

3. **Update `x` and `y`**: The values of `x` and `y` are typically updated to the next tuple in the `points` list. Since `i` is now 1, `x` will be `r[1]` and `y` will be `c[1]`.

4. **Update `nx` and `ny`**: Similarly, `nx` and `ny` will be updated to the next tuple in the `points` list. Since `i` is now 1, `nx` will be `r[2]` and `ny` will be `c[2]`.

5. **Recompute `o` and `ans`**: The values of `o` and `ans` depend on the new values of `x` and `y`:
   - `o` is 1 if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0.
   - `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.

### Updated State:
- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (incremented by 1)
- `points` remains the same: `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]` (updated to the next tuple)
- `y` is `c[1]` (updated to the next tuple)
- `nx` is `r[2]` (updated to the next tuple)
- `ny` is `c[2]` (updated to the next tuple)
- `same` is 0 (unchanged unless modified in the loop body)
- `plus1` is 0 (unchanged unless modified in the loop body)
- `o` is 1 if `(r[1] + c[1]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0
- `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is 0, `plus1` is 0, `o` is 1 if `(r[1] + c[1]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0, `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.**
