The code assigns the next tuple in the `points` list to the variables `nx` and `ny`. Given that `i` is 0, the next tuple is `points[1]`, which is `(r[1], c[1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`**
