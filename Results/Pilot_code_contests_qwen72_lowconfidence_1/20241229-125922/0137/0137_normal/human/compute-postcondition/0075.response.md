The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `plus1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `plus1` and `o` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain in their respective states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `ans` is `ans + plus1`, If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0. If `plus1 == 0`, and if `o` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + same % 2`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. If `plus1 == 0` and `o` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. If `plus1 != 0`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.**
