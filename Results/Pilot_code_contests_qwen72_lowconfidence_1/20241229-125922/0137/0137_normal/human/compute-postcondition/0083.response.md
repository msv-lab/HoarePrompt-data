The code snippet `ans += same // 2` increments the value of `ans` by the integer division of `same` by 2. The value of `ans` before this operation is not specified, so we assume it is an existing variable. The value of `same` is given by the expression `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `plus1`, and `o`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`**
