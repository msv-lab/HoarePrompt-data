The given Python code snippet `ans += same // 2` increments the value of `ans` by the integer division of `same` by 2.

From the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `y` is `c[2]`
- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `ny` is `c[3]`
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`.
- If `same != 0`, the state remains as described in the precondition.

The code snippet `ans += same // 2` only affects the value of `ans` based on the current value of `same`.

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `same` by 2.

### Calculation:
- The value of `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`.
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `y` is `c[2]`
- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `ny` is `c[3]`
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`
- `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1.
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.
- If `same == 0` and `plus1 != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`. If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1. If `same == 0` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`. If `same == 0` and `plus1 != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`.**
