The code snippet `same -= 1` decrements the value of `same` by 1. The value of `same` was initially `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`. After decrementing, `same` becomes `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `plus1`, `o`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`. If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0. `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.**
