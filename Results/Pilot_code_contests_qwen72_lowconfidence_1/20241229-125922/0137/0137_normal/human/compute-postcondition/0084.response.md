The code snippet `ans += same % 2` increments the variable `ans` by the result of `same % 2`. The value of `same` is calculated as `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, which means the increment to `ans` depends on whether `same` is odd or even.

- If `same` is odd, `same % 2` equals 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `same` is even, `same % 2` equals 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Since `ans` was previously incremented by `same // 2`, this additional operation accounts for the remainder when `same` is divided by 2, ensuring `ans` is updated correctly to reflect the total count of something (which is not specified in the context).

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2`.
