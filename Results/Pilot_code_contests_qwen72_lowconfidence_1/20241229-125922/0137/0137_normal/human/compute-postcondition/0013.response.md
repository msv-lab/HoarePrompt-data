The code snippet initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `r`, `c`, or `points`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, with the addition of the new variable `ans` set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-1], c[n-1]), (1, 1)]` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`, `ans` is 0**
