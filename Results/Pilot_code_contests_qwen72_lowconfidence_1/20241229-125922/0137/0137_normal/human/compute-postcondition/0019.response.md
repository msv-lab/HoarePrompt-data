The code `same = nx - x - plus1` calculates the value of `same` based on the current values of `nx`, `x`, and `plus1`.

- `nx` is `r[1]`.
- `x` is `r[0]`.
- `plus1` is `c[1] - c[0]`.

Therefore, the value of `same` is calculated as:

\[ \text{same} = r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) \]

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, along with the new value of `same`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is `c[1] - c[0]`, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`**
