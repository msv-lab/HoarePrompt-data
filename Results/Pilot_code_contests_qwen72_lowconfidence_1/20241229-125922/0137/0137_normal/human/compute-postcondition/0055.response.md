Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`. If `same` is 0, `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0. If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`. If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2 + same // 2\). If `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition. If `o` is 1, `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`. If `o` is 0, `ans` is `ans + same % 2`.***
