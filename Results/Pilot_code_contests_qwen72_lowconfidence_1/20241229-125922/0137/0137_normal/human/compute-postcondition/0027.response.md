The code snippet `ans += same // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division result of `same` by 2. 

Given:
- `ans` is 0.
- `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`.

The new value of `ans` will be `0 + (same // 2)`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`, `(x + y) % 2` is 1, and `o` is 1.**
