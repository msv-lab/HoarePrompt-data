The code snippet `ans += same % 2` adds the remainder of `same` divided by 2 to `ans`.

- `same` is defined as `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`.
- `ans` was previously updated by `ans + same // 2`, which means it already includes the integer division part of `same`.

The current operation adds the remainder of `same` when divided by 2 to `ans`. This will add 0 if `same` is even, or 1 if `same` is odd.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`**
