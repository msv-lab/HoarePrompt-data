The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes occur to the variables in this specific line of code. All the initial state conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2` and then by `same % 2`**
