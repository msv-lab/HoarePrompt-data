The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `same` by 2. Given the initial state, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`. The integer division of `same` by 2 results in `same // 2`, which is added to `ans`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `0 + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`, `o` is 0**
