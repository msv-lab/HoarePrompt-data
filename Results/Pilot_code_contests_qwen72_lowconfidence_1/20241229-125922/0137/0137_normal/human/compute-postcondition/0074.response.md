The `continue` statement causes the program to immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop, bypassing any remaining code in the current iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0, if `plus1 == 0` and `o` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + same % 2`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop, if `plus1 == 0` and `o` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop, if `plus1 != 0`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop, `ans` remains unchanged.**
