The code snippet `ans += same % 2` increments the variable `ans` by the remainder of `same` divided by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `y` is `c[2]`
- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `ny` is `c[3]`
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`
- `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`

The impact of the code:
- `ans` is incremented by the remainder of `same` divided by 2.

Since `same` is defined as `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `same % 2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `y` is `c[2]`
- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `ny` is `c[3]`
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`
- `ans` is incremented by `same // 2` and then by `same % 2`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2` and then by `same % 2`**
