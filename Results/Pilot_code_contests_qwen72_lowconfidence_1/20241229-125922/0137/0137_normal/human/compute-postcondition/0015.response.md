To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is the return value of `func_9()` + 1
- `r` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `c` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]` if the original `n` was greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`
- `ans` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is the return value of `func_9()` + 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `func_9()` must return a value greater than 0 (since `n = func_9() + 1`).

3. **Points List**:
   - If the original `n` (before adding 1) was greater than 0, `points` will be a list of tuples as described.
   - If the original `n` was 0 or less, `points` will be a list containing only `(1, 1)`.

4. **Loop Variable**:
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be 0.
- `points` must be a list of tuples as described, but since `n` is greater than 1, `points` will have at least two elements.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0**
