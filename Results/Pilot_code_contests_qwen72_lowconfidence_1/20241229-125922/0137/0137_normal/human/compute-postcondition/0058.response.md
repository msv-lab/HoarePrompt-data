The code snippet `nx, ny = points[i + 1]` updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the tuple at index `i + 1` in the `points` list. Given that `i` is 1, the values of `nx` and `ny` will be updated to the values of the third tuple in the `points` list, which is `(r[2], c[2])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is 0, `plus1` is 0, `o` is 1 if `(r[1] + c[1]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0, `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.**
