The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves the execution to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`. If `plus1 == 0`, and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`. If `plus1 == 0`, and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`. If `plus1 != 0`, the state remains as described in the precondition.**
