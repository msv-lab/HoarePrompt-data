The given code snippet `continue` does not alter any variables directly. It is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the state remains unchanged except for the fact that the control flow would proceed to the next iteration of the loop if within one.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2 + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) % 2`, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.**
