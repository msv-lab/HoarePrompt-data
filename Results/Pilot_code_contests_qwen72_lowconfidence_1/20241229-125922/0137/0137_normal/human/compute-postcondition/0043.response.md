The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of any variables directly.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is 0, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\). The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
