The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is given, we assume this `continue` is within a loop and its effect is to move to the next iteration without altering any variable states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`. If `plus1 == 0`, and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`. If `plus1 == 0`, and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`. If `plus1 != 0`, the state remains as described in the precondition, except for the increment of `ans`.**
