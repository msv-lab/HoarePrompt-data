The value of `n` is updated by the return value of the function `func_9()`. The exact value of `n` after this assignment depends on what `func_9()` returns. The preconditions regarding `r` and `c` being lists of integers of length `n` and the conditions on their elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element `r[i]` and `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `r[i]` ≤ 10^9, and the points (`r[i]`, `c[i]`) are distinct.**
