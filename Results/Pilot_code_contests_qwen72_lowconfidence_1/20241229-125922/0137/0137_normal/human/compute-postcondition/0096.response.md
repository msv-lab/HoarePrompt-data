The value of `ans` is incremented by the remainder of `same` divided by 2 (`same % 2`). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `o` is either 1 or 0 based on `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.**
