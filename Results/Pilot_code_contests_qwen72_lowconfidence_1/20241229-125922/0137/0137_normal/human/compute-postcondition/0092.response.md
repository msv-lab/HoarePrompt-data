The provided code snippet sets the value of `o` to 1. This impacts the state of the variable `o` but does not affect any other variables or the overall state of the program.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `y` is `c[2]`
- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `ny` is `c[3]`
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`
- `o` is set based on whether `(r[2] + c[2]) % 2 == 1`. If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`. If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.

After executing the code snippet `o = 1`, the value of `o` is explicitly set to 1. The rest of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2` if `o` is true.**
