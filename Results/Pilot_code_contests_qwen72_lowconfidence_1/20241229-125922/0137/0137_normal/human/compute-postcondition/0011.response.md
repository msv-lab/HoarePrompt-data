The code appends the tuple `(1, 1)` to the list `points`. The initial state specifies that `points` is a list of tuples based on the values of `r` and `c`, which are return values from `func_19()`, and the length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is the return value of `func_9()`. After appending `(1, 1)` to `points`, the new state reflects this addition.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is a list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-1], c[n-1]), (1, 1)]` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`.**
