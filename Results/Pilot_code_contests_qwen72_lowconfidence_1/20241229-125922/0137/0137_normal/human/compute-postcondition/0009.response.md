The code appends a new tuple `(r[i], c[i])` to the list `points`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the third element from both `r` and `c` (considering 0-based indexing) will be added to `points`.

- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `r` and `c` remain the return values of `func_19()`.
- `points` was initially `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1])]` and now becomes `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), (r[2], c[2])]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), (r[2], c[2])]`**
