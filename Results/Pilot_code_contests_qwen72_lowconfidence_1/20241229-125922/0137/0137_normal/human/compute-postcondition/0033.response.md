The code snippet `ans += same % 2` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `same % 2` to its current value. Here's the detailed impact:

- `ans` was initially defined as `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2`.
- `same` is defined as `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`.
- The operation `same % 2` computes the remainder when `same` is divided by 2, which can be either 0 or 1.
- The new value of `ans` is `ans + same % 2`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is:

\[
\text{ans} = \left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2
\]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\), `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`, `o` is 0**
