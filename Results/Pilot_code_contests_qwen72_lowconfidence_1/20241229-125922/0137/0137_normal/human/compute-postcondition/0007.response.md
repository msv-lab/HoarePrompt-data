The code appends a new tuple `(r[i], c[i])` to the list `points`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `r` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `c` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `points` is `[(r[0], c[0])]`

After executing the code snippet, the list `points` will have one additional element, which is `(r[1], c[1])`. The values of `n`, `i`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1])]`**
