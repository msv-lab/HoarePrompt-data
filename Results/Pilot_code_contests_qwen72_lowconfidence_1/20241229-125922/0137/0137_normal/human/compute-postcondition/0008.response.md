According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1])]`**
