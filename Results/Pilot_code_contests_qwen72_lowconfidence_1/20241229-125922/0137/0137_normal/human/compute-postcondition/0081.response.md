The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. The loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`
- `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`
- `ans` is `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`

After executing the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow skips the rest of the loop body for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
