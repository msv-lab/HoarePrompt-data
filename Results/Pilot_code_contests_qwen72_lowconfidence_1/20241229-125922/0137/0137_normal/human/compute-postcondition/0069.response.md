The code snippet `ans += same % 2` increments the value of `ans` by the remainder of `same` divided by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`
- if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0
- `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2`

The impact of the code snippet:
- `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`

Calculating the new value of `ans`:
- The current value of `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`
- The new value of `ans` will be `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2 + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) % 2`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2 + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) % 2`**
