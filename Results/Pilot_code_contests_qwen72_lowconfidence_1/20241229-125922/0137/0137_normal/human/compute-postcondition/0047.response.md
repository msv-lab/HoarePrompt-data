The code snippet `ans += same // 2` adds the integer division of `same` by 2 to the variable `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
   - `x` is `r[0]`.
   - `y` is `c[0]`.
   - `nx` is `r[1]`.
   - `ny` is `c[1]`.
   - If `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0.
   - If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`.
   - If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\).
   - If `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition.
   - Additionally, `o` is 1.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated by adding `same // 2` to its current value.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `ans` is now `ans + same // 2`.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
- `x` is `r[0]`.
- `y` is `c[0]`.
- `nx` is `r[1]`.
- `ny` is `c[1]`.
- If `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0.
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`.
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2 + same // 2\).
- If `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition.
- Additionally, `o` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, if `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2 + same // 2\), if `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition, additionally, `o` is 1.**
