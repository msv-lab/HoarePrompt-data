The line of code `ans += same // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `same` by 2 to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`
- `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`
- `ans` is updated based on certain conditions

After executing the code `ans += same // 2`:
- `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `same` by 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `same`, `plus1`, `o`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is `ans + same // 2`**
