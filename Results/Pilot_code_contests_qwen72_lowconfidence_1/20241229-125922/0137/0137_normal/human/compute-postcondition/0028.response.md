The code snippet `ans += same % 2` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `same % 2` to it. Here's the detailed step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
   - `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2`
   - `x` is `r[0]`
   - `y` is `c[0]`
   - `nx` is `r[1]`
   - `ny` is `c[1]`
   - `plus1` is 0
   - `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`
   - `(x + y) % 2` is 1
   - `o` is 1

2. **Calculation**:
   - `same % 2` calculates the remainder when `same` is divided by 2.
   - `ans += same % 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding this remainder to the current value of `ans`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + same % 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
   - `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`
   - `x` is `r[0]`
   - `y` is `c[0]`
   - `nx` is `r[1]`
   - `ny` is `c[1]`
   - `plus1` is 0
   - `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`
   - `(x + y) % 2` is 1
   - `o` is 1

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`, `(x + y) % 2` is 1, and `o` is 1.**
