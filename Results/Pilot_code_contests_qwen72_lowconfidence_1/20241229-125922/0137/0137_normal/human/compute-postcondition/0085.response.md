The `continue` statement in Python causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables, and the program state remains the same except for the control flow which moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2`**
