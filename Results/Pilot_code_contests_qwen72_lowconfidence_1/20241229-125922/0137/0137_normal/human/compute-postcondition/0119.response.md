The function `func_1(ans)` is called, but without knowing the implementation details of `func_1`, we cannot determine exactly how `ans` is modified. However, we assume that `func_1` modifies `ans` in some way. Since no other variables are explicitly modified by this function call, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()` + 1, `r` and `c` are the return values of `func_19()`, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]` if the original `n` was greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`, `ans` is updated by `func_1(ans)`, `i` is `n - 1` (if the loop executed), `x` is `r[n-2]`, `y` is `c[n-2]`, `nx` is 1, `ny` is 1, `plus1` is `1 - c[n-2]`, `same` is `1 - r[n-2] - (1 - c[n-2])`, and `o` is set based on whether `(r[n-2] + c[n-2]) % 2 == 1`.**
