The value of `same` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `same` was `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, so the new value of `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, and `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`.**
