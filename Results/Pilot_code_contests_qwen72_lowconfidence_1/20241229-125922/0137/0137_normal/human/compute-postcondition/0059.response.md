The code snippet `plus1 = ny - y` updates the value of `plus1` based on the difference between `ny` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is 0
- `plus1` is 0
- `o` is 1 if `(r[1] + c[1]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0
- `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`

The value of `plus1` is updated to `ny - y`, which is `c[2] - c[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is 0, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is 1 if `(r[1] + c[1]) % 2 == 1`, otherwise `o` is 0, `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.**
