The code snippet `same -= 1` decrements the value of `same` by 1. We need to consider the initial conditions and the effect of this operation on the variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[0]`
- `y` is `c[0]`
- `nx` is `r[1]`
- `ny` is `c[1]`
- If `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\)
- If `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition
- Additionally, `o` is 0

After executing `same -= 1`:
- The value of `same` is decremented by 1.

Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[0]`
- `y` is `c[0]`
- `nx` is `r[1]`
- `ny` is `c[1]`
- If `same` was 0 before, it remains 0 (since `same` cannot be less than 0), and `plus1` is 0
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\)
- If `same` was not 0 before, `same` is now `same - 1`
- Additionally, `o` is 0

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, if `same` was 0 before, it remains 0 and `plus1` is 0, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2\), if `same` was not 0 before, `same` is now `same - 1`, `o` is 0**
