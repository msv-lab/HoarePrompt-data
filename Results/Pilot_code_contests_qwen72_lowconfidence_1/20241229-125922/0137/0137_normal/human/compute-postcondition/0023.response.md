The code snippet `o = 0` initializes a new variable `o` and assigns it the value 0. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables or their values in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is `c[1] - c[0]`, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`, `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0**
