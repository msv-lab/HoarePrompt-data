The code snippet `ans += same % 2` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `same % 2` to its current value. Let's evaluate the impact of this code:

- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + same % 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `same`, `plus1`, `o`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, we need to consider the value of `same` to determine the new value of `ans`:

- If `same` is 0, then `same % 2` is 0, so `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `same` is not 0, then `same % 2` is 1, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, if `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2 + same // 2\), if `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition, additionally, `o` is 1, `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.**
