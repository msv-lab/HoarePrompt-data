Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + same % 2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
