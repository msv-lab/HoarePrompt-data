The function `func_29` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `n`, `r`, and `c`.

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of points.
- `r` and `c` are lists of integers of length `n`.
- Each element `r[i]` and `c[i]` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `r[i]` ≤ 10^9.
- The points `(r[i], c[i])` are distinct.

Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value from the provided information. However, based on typical function behavior and the given constraints, the function might perform some operation involving the points `(r[i], c[i])` and return a result based on these points.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will provide a general description:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `r` (a list of integers of length `n`), and `c` (a list of integers of length `n`). Each element `r[i]` and `c[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `r[i]` ≤ 10^9, and the points `(r[i], c[i])` are distinct. The function returns a value based on the provided points, but the specific return value is not specified in the given information.**
