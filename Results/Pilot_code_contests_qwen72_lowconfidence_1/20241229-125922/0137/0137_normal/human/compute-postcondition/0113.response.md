The code `same -= 1` decrements the value of `same` by 1. Let's consider the initial state and the impact of this operation:

- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
- `x` is `r[2]`.
- `y` is `c[2]`.
- `nx` is `r[3]`.
- `ny` is `c[3]`.
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`.
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`.

The value of `same` is decremented by 1. The new value of `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`. If `same == -1` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`. If `same == -1` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`, with `same` adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`. If `same == -1` and `plus1 != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`. If `same != -1`, the state remains as described in the precondition.**
