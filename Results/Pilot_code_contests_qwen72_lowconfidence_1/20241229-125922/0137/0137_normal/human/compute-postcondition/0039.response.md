The code snippet `ans += 0` does not change the value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is 0, `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2`.**
