The code snippet `x, y = points[i]` updates the values of `x` and `y` based on the tuple at index `i` in the `points` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the tuple at `points[2]` will be assigned to `x` and `y`.

From the initial state:
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
- `i` is 2.

Therefore, `points[2]` is `(r[2], c[2])`.

So, after executing the code:
- `x` will be `r[2]`.
- `y` will be `c[2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, and `o` is set based on whether `(r[2] + c[2]) % 2 == 1`. If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`. If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.**
