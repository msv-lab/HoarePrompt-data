The code snippet `ans += same % 2` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `same % 2` to its current value. Let's evaluate the impact:

- `same` is defined as `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`. The exact value of `same` is not specified, but it is used in the calculation.
- `same % 2` will be 0 if `same` is even, and 1 if `same` is odd.
- `ans` is updated by adding this result to its current value.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `points`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `plus1`, `o`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + same % 2`.**
