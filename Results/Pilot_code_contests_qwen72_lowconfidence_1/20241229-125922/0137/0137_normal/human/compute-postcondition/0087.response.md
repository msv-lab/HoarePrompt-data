To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop conditions step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
- `x` is `r[1]`.
- `y` is `c[1]`.
- `nx` is `r[2]`.
- `ny` is `c[2]`.
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`.
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`.
- `o` is set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`.
- If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`.
- If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
3. **List `points`**: The list `points` remains the same, but the indices for `x`, `y`, `nx`, and `ny` will change.
4. **Variables Update**:
   - `x` will now be `r[2]`.
   - `y` will now be `c[2]`.
   - `nx` will now be `r[3]`.
   - `ny` will now be `c[3]`.
5. **Calculations**:
   - `same` will be recalculated as `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`.
   - `plus1` will be recalculated as `c[3] - c[2]`.
   - `o` will be set based on whether `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, where `x` is now `r[2]` and `y` is now `c[2]`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is `r[2]`.
- `y` is `c[2]`.
- `nx` is `r[3]`.
- `ny` is `c[3]`.
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`.
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`.
- `o` is set based on whether `(r[2] + c[2]) % 2 == 1`.
- If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`.
- If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, and `o` is set based on whether `(r[2] + c[2]) % 2 == 1`. If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`. If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.**
