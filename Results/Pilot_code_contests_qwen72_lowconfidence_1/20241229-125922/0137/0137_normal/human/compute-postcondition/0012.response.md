The `points.sort()` method sorts the list `points` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, and if there are ties, based on the second element. The sorting does not change the values of `n`, `r`, or `c`, only the order of the elements in the `points` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the return value of `func_9()`
- `r` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `c` is the return value of `func_19()`
- `points` is a list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-1], c[n-1]), (1, 1)]` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`.

After executing `points.sort()`, the list `points` will be sorted, but the values of `n`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_9()`, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-1], c[n-1]), (1, 1)]` if `n` is greater than 0, otherwise `points` is a list containing only `(1, 1)`**.
