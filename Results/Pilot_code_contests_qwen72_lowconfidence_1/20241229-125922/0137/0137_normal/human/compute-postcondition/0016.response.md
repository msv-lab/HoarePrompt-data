The code assigns the first element of the `points` list to the variables `x` and `y`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `points` is `points[0]`, which is `(r[0], c[0])`. Therefore, `x` is set to `r[0]` and `y` is set to `c[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`**
