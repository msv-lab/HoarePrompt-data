To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions required for the loop to run at least once. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
2. **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function when the loop begins.
3. **Other Variables (`r`, `c`, `points`)**: These variables do not directly affect the execution of the loop. However, they are part of the initial state and should be included in the final state.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be 0 when the loop starts.
- `r` and `c` are the return values of `func_19()`, and `points` is an empty list.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is an empty list**
