The code snippet `ans += same // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the floor division result of `same` divided by 2 to its current value. The initial state provides the following relevant information:

- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`.
- `x` is `r[2]`.
- `y` is `c[2]`.
- `nx` is `r[3]`.
- `ny` is `c[3]`.
- `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`.

The conditions for `o` and the increments to `ans` based on `same` and `plus1` are as follows:

- If `same == -1` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.
- If `same == -1` and `plus1 == 0` and `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2 + same % 2`.
- If `same == -1` and `plus1 != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `c[3] - c[2]`.
- If `same != -1`, the state remains as described in the precondition.

Given the initial state, the value of `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`. For the purpose of this calculation, let's assume `same` is already calculated and is either `-1` or some other value.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- If `same` is `-1`, the floor division `same // 2` results in `-1`.
- If `same` is any other value, the floor division `same // 2` results in the integer part of `same / 2`.

### Output State:
- If `same` is `-1`, `ans` is incremented by `-1`.
- If `same` is not `-1`, `ans` is incremented by the floor division result of `same // 2`.

Since the exact value of `same` is not provided, we can only express the change in `ans` in terms of `same`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2`.**
