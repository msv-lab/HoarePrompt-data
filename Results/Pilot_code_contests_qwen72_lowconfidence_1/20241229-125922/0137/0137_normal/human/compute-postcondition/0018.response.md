The code assigns the value of `ny - y` to the variable `plus1`. Given the initial state, `y` is `c[0]` and `ny` is `c[1]`, so `plus1` will be `c[1] - c[0]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is `c[1] - c[0]`**
