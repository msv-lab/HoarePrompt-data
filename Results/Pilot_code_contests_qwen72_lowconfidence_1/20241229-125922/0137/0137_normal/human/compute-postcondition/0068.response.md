The code snippet `ans += same // 2` adds the integer division of `same` by 2 to `ans`. Given the initial state, we need to calculate the new value of `ans` based on the current value of `same`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0.
- `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.

### Impact of the Code:
- `ans` is updated by adding `same // 2` to its current value.

### Calculation:
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`
- The integer division `same // 2` is calculated.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (same // 2)`.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`
- `x` is `r[1]`
- `y` is `c[1]`
- `nx` is `r[2]`
- `ny` is `c[2]`
- `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`
- `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`
- If `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0.
- `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1, otherwise `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1]) - 1) // 2`**
