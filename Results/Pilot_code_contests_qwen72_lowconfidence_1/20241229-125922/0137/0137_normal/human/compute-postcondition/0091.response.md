The code snippet `same = nx - x - plus1` updates the value of `same` using the existing values of `nx`, `x`, and `plus1`.

- `nx` is `r[3]`
- `x` is `r[2]`
- `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`

So, `same` is now calculated as:

\[ \text{same} = \text{nx} - \text{x} - \text{plus1} \]
\[ \text{same} = \text{r[3]} - \text{r[2]} - (\text{c[3]} - \text{c[2]}) \]

This calculation replaces the previous value of `same` which was initially defined as `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`. However, since the new calculation is essentially the same, the value of `same` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[2]`, `y` is `c[2]`, `nx` is `r[3]`, `ny` is `c[3]`, `same` is `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2])`, `plus1` is `c[3] - c[2]`, and `o` is set based on whether `(r[2] + c[2]) % 2 == 1`. If `o` is true, `ans` is updated to `ans + same // 2 + same % 2`. If `o` is false, `ans` is incremented by `same // 2 + same % 2` where `same` is adjusted to `r[3] - r[2] - (c[3] - c[2]) - 1`.**
