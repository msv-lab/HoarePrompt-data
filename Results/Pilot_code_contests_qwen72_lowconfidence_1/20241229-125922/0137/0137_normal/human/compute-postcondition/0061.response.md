The code snippet `o = 1` updates the value of `o` to 1. This overrides the previous condition-based assignment of `o`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, `o` is 1, `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.**
