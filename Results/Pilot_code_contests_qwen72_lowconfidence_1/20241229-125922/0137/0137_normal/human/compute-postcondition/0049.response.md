The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, if `same` is 0, then `plus1` is 0 and `same` is 0, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is 1, and `ans` is `(r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])) // 2 + same % 2 + same // 2`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 0`, `o` is 0, and `ans` is \(\left( (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) // 2 \right) + (r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1) \% 2 + same // 2\), if `same` is not 0, the variables remain unchanged from the precondition, additionally, `o` is 1, `ans` is incremented by `same % 2`.**
