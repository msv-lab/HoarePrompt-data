The code snippet provided decrements the value of `same` by 1. Given the initial state, `same` is defined as `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0])`. After decrementing `same` by 1, its new value becomes `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `points`, `ans`, `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, `plus1`, and `o` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `ans` is 0, `x` is `r[0]`, `y` is `c[0]`, `nx` is `r[1]`, `ny` is `c[1]`, `plus1` is 0, `same` is `r[1] - r[0] - (c[1] - c[0]) - 1`, `o` is 0**
