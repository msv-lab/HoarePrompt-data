The code snippet appends a tuple `(r[i], c[i])` to the list `points`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the first elements of `r` and `c` (which are the return values of `func_19()`) are used to form the tuple.

Since `points` was initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `points` will contain one tuple: `(r[0], c[0])`.

The other variables remain unchanged except for `points`, which now contains this new tuple. The specific values of `r[0]` and `c[0]` depend on the return values of `func_19()`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_19()`, `c` is the return value of `func_19()`, `points` is `[(r[0], c[0])]`**
