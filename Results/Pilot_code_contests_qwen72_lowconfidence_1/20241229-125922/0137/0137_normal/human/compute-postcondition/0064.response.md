The code snippet `ans += same // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `same` by 2. Let's go through the details:

- `ans` is recalculated based on the new values of `x`, `y`, `nx`, `ny`, and `same`.
- `same` is calculated as `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`.
- The integer division `same // 2` means that the quotient of `same` divided by 2 (ignoring the remainder) is added to `ans`.

Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is recalculated based on these values, we need to consider the updated value of `ans` after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `points` is a sorted list of tuples `[(r[0], c[0]), (r[1], c[1]), ..., (r[n-2], c[n-2]), (1, 1)]`, `x` is `r[1]`, `y` is `c[1]`, `nx` is `r[2]`, `ny` is `c[2]`, `same` is `r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])`, `plus1` is `c[2] - c[1]`, if `(x + y) % 2 == 1`, `o` is set to 1. Otherwise, `o` is set to 0, `ans` is `ans + (r[2] - r[1] - (c[2] - c[1])) // 2`.**
