The function `func_23` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace characters by default. Each substring is converted to a float, and the resulting map object is returned. The function assumes that `func_17` returns a string where each element can be successfully converted to a float. If `func_17` returns a non-string value or if any substring cannot be converted to a float, a `ValueError` or `TypeError` will be raised. The final state of the program includes the returned map object, which can be iterated over to access the converted float values.
