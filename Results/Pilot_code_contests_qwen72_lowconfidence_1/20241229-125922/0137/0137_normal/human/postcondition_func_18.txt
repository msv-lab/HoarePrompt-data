The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `var` of any type that can be converted to a string. It writes the string representation of `var` to the standard output (stdout) and does not return any value. After the function executes, the string representation of `var` will have been printed to the console, and the function will have no other side effects. Note that if `var` cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.
