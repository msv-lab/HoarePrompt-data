The function `func_12` does not actually process the list of tuples `points` as described in the annotations. Instead, it calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as its argument. The function `func_12` itself does not return any value or modify the `points` list. The state of the program after `func_12` concludes depends entirely on the behavior of `func_1`, which is not provided in the given code. Therefore, from the user's perspective, `func_12` simply triggers the execution of `func_1` with a fixed argument.
