t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. points is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains a list of integers r and a list of integers c, such that for each point (r_i, c_i), 1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ r_i. The total number of points across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and all points within a test case are distinct.
