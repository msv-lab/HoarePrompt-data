The function `func_15` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is not zero. It returns the absolute value of the product of the integer division of `a` by the result of `func_6(a, b)` and `b`. The function assumes that `func_6(a, b)` returns an integer. If `func_6(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError. The final state of the program is that the function has returned an integer value, which is the absolute value of the computed product.
