If `flush` is True, the `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of values `args`, a separator string `sep`, a file object `file`, an ending string `end`, and a boolean `flush`. It writes the string representations of the values in `args` to the `file` object, separating them by `sep`, and appends `end` after the last value. If `flush` is `True`, the function forcibly flushes the stream. If `args` is empty, the function only writes `end` to the `file` object and optionally flushes the stream based on the `flush` parameter.

    #The program returns `wrapped_func`, which is a function. No information about `stack` is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a function `f` and an optional parameter `stack` (initialized as an empty list). It returns a new function `wrapped_func`. The `stack` parameter is not modified or used within the function, and no information about `stack` is returned. The primary purpose of `func_2` is to create and return a new function `wrapped_func`, which can be used independently of the original function `f` and the `stack` parameter.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `wrapped_func` appears to be a generic wrapper for a coroutine or generator-based function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem of finding the minimum cost path in an infinite triangle. However, I can still provide a precondition for the function based on the context of the problem and the function's signature.

### Precondition
**args is a tuple of arguments, and kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments. The function `f` is expected to be a generator or a coroutine that yields values or sends values back to the caller. The variable `stack` is a list that is used to manage the state of the generator or coroutine, and it should be initialized before calling `wrapped_func`.**

This precondition describes the expected input types and the state management mechanism required for the function to operate correctly. However, this function does not directly solve the problem of finding the minimum cost path in an infinite triangle. It is likely part of a larger system that uses coroutines or generators to manage the state of the path-finding process.
def wrapped_func():
    if stack :
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
        #The program returns the result of calling the generator or coroutine function `f` with the provided arguments `*args` and `
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `args` is a tuple of arguments, and `kwargs` is a dictionary of keyword arguments. The function `f` is expected to be a generator or a coroutine that yields values or sends values back to the caller. The variable `stack` is a list that is used to manage the state of the generator or coroutine, and it should be initialized before calling `wrapped_func`. Additionally, `stack` is empty.
    to = f(*args, **kwargs)
    while True:
        if type(to) is GeneratorType:
            stack.append(to)
            to = next(to)
            continue
        
        stack.pop()
        
        if not stack:
            break
        
        to = stack[-1].send(to)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of arguments, `kwargs` is a dictionary of keyword arguments, `stack` is an empty list, `to` is the final value returned by the last generator or coroutine in the stack, and the loop has completed execution.
    return to
    #The program returns the final value `to` which is the value returned by the last generator or coroutine in the `stack`, and the loop has completed execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The `wrapped_func` function manages the execution of a generator or coroutine function `f` by maintaining a stack of active generators/coroutines. It accepts `*args` and `

    for p in range(t):
        func_29()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `p` is `t - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It iterates `t` times, calling the function `func_29()` in each iteration. The function does not modify the value of `t` and does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `p` (the loop counter) will be equal to `t - 1`. The function does not determine or return whether `t` is odd or even, contrary to the provided return postcondition.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are non-negative integers, and p is a positive integer.
def func_4(A, B, p):
    res = 1
    A = A % p
    if (A == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`A` is `A % p`, `B` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a positive integer, `res` is 1, and `A` is not 0
    while B > 0:
        if B & 1 == 1:
            res = res * A % p
        
        B = B >> 1
        
        A = A * A % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `B` is 0, `res` is `A^B % p` where `A` and `B` are the original values of `A` and `B`, `A` is `A^(2^n) % p` where `n` is the number of iterations, and `p` remains a positive integer.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is `A^0 % p`, where `A` is `A^(2^n) % p` after `n` iterations, and `p` is a positive integer. Since `B` is 0, `res` simplifies to `A^0 % p` which is always 1 (since any non-zero number to the power of 0 is 1). Therefore, the program returns 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `A`, `B`, and `p`, where `A` and `B` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `A^B % p`, where `A` and `B` are the original values of the input parameters. If `A` is 0 modulo `p` (i.e., `A % p == 0`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the result of `A^B % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `B` is 0, returning 1 in such scenarios.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_5(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([start, n // start] for start in range(1, 
    int(n ** 0.5) + 1) if n % start == 0)))
    #The program returns a set containing all unique divisors of the positive integer `n`, including 1 and `n` itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n` by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` and checking for divisibility. If a number is a divisor, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient are added to the result set. This ensures that all divisors are included without duplicates. Edge cases, such as when `n` is 1, are handled correctly, returning a set containing only `{1}`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_6(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return a

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *a and b are non-negative integers, and a is not equal to b
    while b > 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `b` is 0, `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`, where `b` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it directly returns `a`. In all other cases, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively reduces the problem until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function ensures that the returned value is always the GCD of the input values, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are equal or not.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of integers.
def func_7(ar):
    return list(accumulate(ar))
    #The program returns a list of the accumulated sums of the elements in the list `ar`. Each element in the returned list represents the sum of all preceding elements (including itself) from the original list `ar`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list up to that point. Specifically, the i-th element in the returned list is the sum of the first i+1 elements of the input list `ar`. If the input list `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of integers.
def func_8(ar):
    return list(accumulate(ar[::-1]))[::-1]
    #The program returns a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar` up to that index, but calculated in reverse order and then reversed back to maintain the original order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar` up to that index, calculated in reverse order and then reversed back to maintain the original order. This means that for each element in the returned list, it represents the sum of all elements from the current position to the end of the list in the original list. If the input list `ar` is empty, the function returns an empty list. If the input list contains a single element, the function returns a list with that same single element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem or the function's operation. The function `func_9` does not take any parameters and simply returns the integer result of calling `func_17()`.
def func_9():
    return int(func_17())
    #The program returns the integer result of calling `func_17()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17` and returns the integer result of that call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives an integer value representing the result of `func_17`. If `func_17` returns a non-integer value, `int(func_17())` will attempt to convert it to an integer, which could result in a loss of precision or a `ValueError` if the conversion is not possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r1, c1, r2, and c2 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ c1 ≤ r1, 1 ≤ c2 ≤ r2, and r2 = r1 + 1.
def func_10():
    func_1('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:- If `func_1` modifies any global variables or external state, those changes will be reflected after `func_10` is called.
- If `func_1` has side effects (e.g., printing to the console, writing to a file), these side effects will occur when `func_10` is executed.
- The function `func_10` does not handle any errors or exceptions that might be raised by `func_1`.
- The function `func_10` does not validate the external parameters `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2`, so it assumes they are always valid according to the given conditions. If these conditions are not met, the behavior of `func_10` is undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r1, c1, r2, c2 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ c1 ≤ r1 and 1 ≤ c2 ≤ r2.
def func_11():
    func_1('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'NO' as its argument. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to the input parameters `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2`, as these parameters are not used within `func_11`. The overall effect of calling `func_11` is solely dependent on the behavior of `func_1` when called with the argument 'NO'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: points is a list of tuples, where each tuple (r, c) represents a point in the infinite triangle with 1 ≤ c ≤ r and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^9. The list contains n points, and all points are distinct.
def func_12():
    func_1('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` does not actually process the list of tuples `points` as described in the annotations. Instead, it calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as its argument. The function `func_12` itself does not return any value or modify the `points` list. The state of the program after `func_12` concludes depends entirely on the behavior of `func_1`, which is not provided in the given code. Therefore, from the user's perspective, `func_12` simply triggers the execution of `func_1` with a fixed argument.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_13` does not contribute to solving the problem as described. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'No' as an argument, which is unrelated to the problem's context involving points in an infinite triangle and calculating the minimum cost path. Therefore, I cannot derive a meaningful precondition from `func_13` based on the problem description. Please provide a relevant function that interacts with the variables and logic described in the problem statement.
def func_13():
    func_1('No')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters and invokes another function `func_1` with the string 'No' as an argument. After the function `func_13` completes its execution, `func_1` has been called with the argument 'No', but the specific effects of `func_1` on the program state are not defined within `func_13`. Since `func_13` does not return any value, the final state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effects caused by `func_1` (if any).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer.
def func_14(start):
    start = start - (start >> 1 & 1431655765)
    start = (start & 858993459) + (start >> 2 & 858993459)
    return ((start + (start >> 4) & 252645135) * 16843009 & 4294967295) >> 24
    #The program returns an integer value calculated as (((start + (start >> 4) & 252645135) * 16843009 & 4294967295) >> 24), where `start` is updated to `(start & 858993459) + (start >> 2 & 858993459)` before the calculation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `start` and performs a series of bitwise operations on it. The function ultimately returns an integer value that is the result of a complex bitwise and arithmetic transformation of the input `start`. Specifically, the function updates `start` through a series of bitwise AND, OR, and shift operations, and then applies a final transformation to produce the output. The final state of the program after the function call is that the input `start` is no longer accessible in its original form, and the function returns an integer value that is the result of the transformations. Edge cases, such as negative input values or very large integers, are handled by the bitwise operations, which ensure that the result is within the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b is not zero.
def func_15(a, b):
    return abs(a // func_6(a, b) * b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of the integer division of `a` by the result of `func_6(a, b)` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is not zero. It returns the absolute value of the product of the integer division of `a` by the result of `func_6(a, b)` and `b`. The function assumes that `func_6(a, b)` returns an integer. If `func_6(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError. The final state of the program is that the function has returned an integer value, which is the absolute value of the computed product.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.

    else :
        return fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod
        #The program returns the value of `fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod`, where `fac[n]` is the factorial of `n`, `finv[r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `r`, and `finv[n - r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `n - r`. The calculation is performed under modulo `mod`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `r` such that `0 <= r <= n`. It returns `0` if `n < r`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod`, where `fac[n]` is the factorial of `n`, `finv[r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `r`, and `finv[n - r]` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of `n - r`, under modulo `mod`. The function assumes that `fac` and `finv` arrays are precomputed and available in the scope. If these arrays are not properly initialized, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_17():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #The program returns the input line read from the standard input (stdin) with the trailing newline and carriage return characters removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` reads a line from the standard input (stdin) and returns it with the trailing newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) characters removed. If the input is empty or contains no trailing newline or carriage return, the function still returns the input as is, without any modifications. The function does not handle any other types of whitespace or special characters, and it does not modify the state of the program beyond returning the processed input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: var is a value of any type that can be converted to a string.
def func_18(var):
    sys.stdout.write(str(var))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `var` of any type that can be converted to a string. It writes the string representation of `var` to the standard output (stdout) and does not return any value. After the function executes, the string representation of `var` will have been printed to the console, and the function will have no other side effects. Note that if `var` cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem description or the specific task. The function `func_19` does not take any arguments and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()` and converting each element to an integer.
def func_19():
    return list(map(int, func_17().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()` and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. If `func_17` returns an empty string or a string without any numeric components, `func_19` will return an empty list. If `func_17` returns a string with non-numeric substrings, `func_19` will raise a `ValueError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem description provided. The function `func_20` appears to be a standalone utility function that does not interact with the variables or logic required for solving the infinite triangle problem.
def func_20():
    return list(map(str, func_17().split()))
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()` and then converting each element to a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace (or whatever delimiter `split()` uses by default), and each substring is converted to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the elements are already strings). The function returns a list of these substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_20` will return an empty list. If `func_17` raises an exception, `func_20` will propagate that exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are provided to the function `func_21`.
def func_21():
    return map(int, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the list obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()` into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_21` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings using the default whitespace delimiter. Each substring in the resulting list is converted to an integer, and a map object representing this conversion process is returned. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object is returned, which can be iterated over to obtain the converted integers. If `func_17` returns a string that contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert those values to integers. Additionally, if `func_17` returns an empty string, the map object will be empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature relate to the problem description. The function `func_22` appears to be a standalone utility function that processes the output of another function `func_17`. It does not take any parameters and returns a map object of strings split from the output of `func_17`.
def func_22():
    return map(str, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object where each element is a string resulting from splitting the output of `func_17()` by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_22` is a standalone utility function that does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. The output of `func_17` is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and these substrings are returned as a map object where each element is a string. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_22` will return an empty map object. If `func_17` raises an exception, `func_22` will also raise that exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, so there is no precondition to state.
def func_23():
    return map(float, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the string returned by `func_17()` into a float. The elements are split based on whitespace by default.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_23` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace characters by default. Each substring is converted to a float, and the resulting map object is returned. The function assumes that `func_17` returns a string where each element can be successfully converted to a float. If `func_17` returns a non-string value or if any substring cannot be converted to a float, a `ValueError` or `TypeError` will be raised. The final state of the program includes the returned map object, which can be iterated over to access the converted float values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None, as the function `func_24` does not have any parameters or relevant variables.**
def func_24():
    func_18('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_18` with the newline character `'\n'` as its argument. The final state of the program after `func_24` concludes depends on the behavior of `func_18`. Since the exact behavior of `func_18` is not provided, we can only infer that `func_24` indirectly performs whatever action `func_18` does when given `'\n'` as input. If `func_18` modifies any global state or produces side effects (e.g., printing to the console, modifying a file, etc.), those changes will be the final state of the program after `func_24` completes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, and v is a value of any type.
def func_25(n, v):
    return [v] * n
    #The program returns a list containing `n` repetitions of the value `v`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `v` is a value of any type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_25` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer) and `v` (a value of any type). It returns a list containing `n` repetitions of the value `v`. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not have any side effects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, v is a value of any type.
def func_26(n, m, v):

    #The program returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` elements, all being the value `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_26` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist contains `m` elements, all of which are the value `v`. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are non-negative integers. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. If `m` is 0, the function returns a list of `n` empty sublists. The function does not modify the input parameters and does not have any side effects.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and p are non-negative integers, v is a value of any type.
def func_27(n, m, p, v):
    return [[([v] * p) for _ in range(m)] for start in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 3D list where each element in the outermost list is a 2D list of size m x p, and each element in these 2D lists is the value `v`. The total number of such 2D lists is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_27` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `p`, and `v`. It returns a 3D list where each element in the outermost list is a 2D list of size `m` x `p`, and each element in these 2D lists is the value `v`. The total number of such 2D lists is `n`. The function correctly handles the case where `n`, `m`, and `p` are zero, returning an empty 3D list if any of these parameters are zero. If `v` is a mutable object (like a list), all elements in the 3D list will reference the same object, which could lead to unintended side effects if the object is modified.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b > 0.
def func_28(a, b):
    return (a + b - 1) // b
    #The program returns the integer division result of (a + b - 1) // b, where a and b are integers with b being greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_28` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both are integers and `b` is greater than 0. It returns the integer division result of `(a + b - 1) // b`. This effectively computes the ceiling of the division `a / b` as an integer. For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 3`, the function returns 2. If `a = 0` and `b = 1`, the function returns 0. The function handles all valid integer inputs for `a` and `b` (with `b > 0`) correctly.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_29` processes a set of distinct points defined by their coordinates `(r[i], c[i])` where `1 ≤ c[i] ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9`. It appends a fixed point `(1, 1)` to the list of points, sorts the points, and then calculates a cumulative result `ans` based on the differences between consecutive points. The function ultimately calls another function `func_1` with the calculated `ans` as its argument. The function does not return any value directly. The final state of the program includes `n` being incremented by 1, `points` being a sorted list of the original points plus `(1, 1)`, and `ans` being the cumulative result of the loop calculations. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0, leading to `points` initially being an empty list before appending `(1, 1)`, and the behavior when the points are already sorted or contain very large values.
