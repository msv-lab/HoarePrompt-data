The provided function `func_13` does not contribute to solving the problem as described. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'No' as an argument, which is unrelated to the problem's context involving points in an infinite triangle and calculating the minimum cost path. Therefore, I cannot derive a meaningful precondition from `func_13` based on the problem description. Please provide a relevant function that interacts with the variables and logic described in the problem statement.
