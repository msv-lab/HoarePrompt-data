The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17` and returns the integer result of that call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives an integer value representing the result of `func_17`. If `func_17` returns a non-integer value, `int(func_17())` will attempt to convert it to an integer, which could result in a loss of precision or a `ValueError` if the conversion is not possible.
