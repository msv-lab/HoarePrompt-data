The provided function `wrapped_func` appears to be a generic wrapper for a coroutine or generator-based function, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem of finding the minimum cost path in an infinite triangle. However, I can still provide a precondition for the function based on the context of the problem and the function's signature.

### Precondition
**args is a tuple of arguments, and kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments. The function `f` is expected to be a generator or a coroutine that yields values or sends values back to the caller. The variable `stack` is a list that is used to manage the state of the generator or coroutine, and it should be initialized before calling `wrapped_func`.**

This precondition describes the expected input types and the state management mechanism required for the function to operate correctly. However, this function does not directly solve the problem of finding the minimum cost path in an infinite triangle. It is likely part of a larger system that uses coroutines or generators to manage the state of the path-finding process.
