The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace (or whatever delimiter `split()` uses by default), and each substring is converted to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the elements are already strings). The function returns a list of these substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_20` will return an empty list. If `func_17` raises an exception, `func_20` will propagate that exception.
