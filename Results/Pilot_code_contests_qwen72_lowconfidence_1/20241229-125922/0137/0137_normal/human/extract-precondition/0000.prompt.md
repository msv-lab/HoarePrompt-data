You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Consider an infinite triangle made up of layers. Let's number the layers, starting from one, from the top of the triangle (from top to bottom). The k-th layer of the triangle contains k points, numbered from left to right. Each point of an infinite triangle is described by a pair of numbers (r, c) (1 ≤ c ≤ r), where r is the number of the layer, and c is the number of the point in the layer. From each point (r, c) there are two directed edges to the points (r+1, c) and (r+1, c+1), but only one of the edges is activated. If r + c is even, then the edge to the point (r+1, c) is activated, otherwise the edge to the point (r+1, c+1) is activated. Look at the picture for a better understanding.

<image> Activated edges are colored in black. Non-activated edges are colored in gray.

From the point (r_1, c_1) it is possible to reach the point (r_2, c_2), if there is a path between them only from activated edges. For example, in the picture above, there is a path from (1, 1) to (3, 2), but there is no path from (2, 1) to (1, 1).

Initially, you are at the point (1, 1). For each turn, you can: 

  * Replace activated edge for point (r, c). That is if the edge to the point (r+1, c) is activated, then instead of it, the edge to the point (r+1, c+1) becomes activated, otherwise if the edge to the point (r+1, c+1), then instead if it, the edge to the point (r+1, c) becomes activated. This action increases the cost of the path by 1; 
  * Move from the current point to another by following the activated edge. This action does not increase the cost of the path. 



You are given a sequence of n points of an infinite triangle (r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), …, (r_n, c_n). Find the minimum cost path from (1, 1), passing through all n points in arbitrary order.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case begins with a line containing one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) is the number of points to visit.

The second line contains n numbers r_1, r_2, …, r_n (1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9), where r_i is the number of the layer in which i-th point is located.

The third line contains n numbers c_1, c_2, …, c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ r_i), where c_i is the number of the i-th point in the r_i layer.

It is guaranteed that all n points are distinct.

It is guaranteed that there is always at least one way to traverse all n points.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output the minimum cost of a path passing through all points in the corresponding test case.
