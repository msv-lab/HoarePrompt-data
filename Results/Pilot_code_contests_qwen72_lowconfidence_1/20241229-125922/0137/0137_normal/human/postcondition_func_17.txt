The function `func_17` reads a line from the standard input (stdin) and returns it with the trailing newline (`\n`) and carriage return (`\r`) characters removed. If the input is empty or contains no trailing newline or carriage return, the function still returns the input as is, without any modifications. The function does not handle any other types of whitespace or special characters, and it does not modify the state of the program beyond returning the processed input string.
