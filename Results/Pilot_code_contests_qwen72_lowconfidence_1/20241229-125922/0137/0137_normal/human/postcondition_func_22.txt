`func_22` is a standalone utility function that does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. The output of `func_17` is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and these substrings are returned as a map object where each element is a string. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_22` will return an empty map object. If `func_17` raises an exception, `func_22` will also raise that exception.
