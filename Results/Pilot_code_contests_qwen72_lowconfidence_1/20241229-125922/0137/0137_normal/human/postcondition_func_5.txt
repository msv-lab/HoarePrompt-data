The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all unique divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n` by iterating through numbers from 1 to the square root of `n` and checking for divisibility. If a number is a divisor, both the divisor and its corresponding quotient are added to the result set. This ensures that all divisors are included without duplicates. Edge cases, such as when `n` is 1, are handled correctly, returning a set containing only `{1}`.
