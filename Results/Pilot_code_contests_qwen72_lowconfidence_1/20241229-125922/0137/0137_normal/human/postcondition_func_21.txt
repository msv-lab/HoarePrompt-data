The function `func_21` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings using the default whitespace delimiter. Each substring in the resulting list is converted to an integer, and a map object representing this conversion process is returned. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object is returned, which can be iterated over to obtain the converted integers. If `func_17` returns a string that contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert those values to integers. Additionally, if `func_17` returns an empty string, the map object will be empty.
