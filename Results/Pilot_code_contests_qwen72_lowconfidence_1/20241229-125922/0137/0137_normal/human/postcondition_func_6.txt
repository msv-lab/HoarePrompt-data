The function `func_6` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it directly returns `a`. In all other cases, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively reduces the problem until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function ensures that the returned value is always the GCD of the input values, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are equal or not.
