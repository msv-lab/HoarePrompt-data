args is a tuple of any values, and kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, 'file' is a file-like object to which the output is written, 'end' is a bytes object appended after the last argument, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
