Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not fully adhere to the problem description in all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the edge case where `n` is 1. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the only possible scenario is that Alice starts and ends at the same cell (cell 1). However, the program does not account for this scenario correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1
1
```
The expected output is 0 because Alice cannot move to an adjacent cell (since there are no other cells), and she cannot answer "NO" to Bob's question if she is on cell 1. However, the program will incorrectly output 1.

This indicates that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, making it incorrect.
