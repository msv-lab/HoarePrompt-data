Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it processes the questions and calculates the valid scenarios for Alice. Specifically, the way the `counter` array is used and updated might not correctly account for all possible movements and scenarios. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Case Where the Program Fails
Consider the following input:
```
5 3
1 2 3
```

### Expected Output
For this input, the expected output should be:
```
6
```
The valid scenarios are:
- (1, 2): Alice starts at cell 1, stays there for the first question, then moves to cell 2.
- (2, 1): Alice starts at cell 2, stays there for the first question, then moves to cell 1.
- (2, 3): Alice starts at cell 2, stays there for the first two questions, then moves to cell 3.
- (3, 2): Alice starts at cell 3, stays there for the first question, then moves to cell 2.
- (4, 3): Alice starts at cell 4, stays there for the first question, then moves to cell 3.
- (5, 4): Alice starts at cell 5, stays there for the first question, then moves to cell 4.

### Actual Output
However, the program as written will produce an incorrect output. The logic in the program does not correctly handle the transitions between cells and the conditions for valid scenarios.

### Analysis
The main issue lies in the way the `counter` array is used to track the indices of the questions. The program does not correctly account for all possible movements and transitions between cells. Specifically, the conditions for checking if a scenario is valid are not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

To fix this, the program needs a more comprehensive approach to track the movements and ensure that all valid scenarios are counted correctly. This involves a more detailed analysis of the questions and the possible movements Alice can make.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the logical flaw in handling the valid scenarios.
