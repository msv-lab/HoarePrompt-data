Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` is intended to solve the problem described, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to count the number of scenarios that allow Alice to answer "NO" to all of Bob's questions. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Cells**: The function attempts to count scenarios where Alice can move to an adjacent cell, but it does not correctly handle all cases where Alice can move before or after answering a question. Specifically, the logic for checking consecutive cells and their indices is flawed.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if Bob's questions cover all cells from 1 to n, the function should return 0, but it may not do so correctly due to the flawed logic.

3. **Complexity and Redundancy**: The function has multiple loops and conditions that are redundant and may lead to incorrect results. For instance, the nested `if-else` statements are overly complex and do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 3`, `x = [5, 1, 4]`
- Expected Output: `9`
- Actual Output: The function may not return 9 due to the incorrect logic in handling consecutive cells and their indices.

Given these issues, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
