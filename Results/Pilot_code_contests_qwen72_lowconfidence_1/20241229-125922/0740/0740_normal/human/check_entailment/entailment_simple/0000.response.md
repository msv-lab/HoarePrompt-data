Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem described. Let's break down the solution and see how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of cells `n` and the number of questions `k`.
   - It then reads the list of Bob's questions `x`.

2. **Tracking Occurrences:**
   - The program uses a list `counter` of size `n + 1` to track the first and last occurrences of each cell in Bob's questions.
   - For each cell `xi` in Bob's questions, it updates the `counter` list with the first and last indices of its occurrence.

3. **Counting Valid Scenarios:**
   - The program initializes a variable `res` to count the number of valid scenarios.
   - It iterates over each cell from 1 to `n` and checks if the cell does not appear in Bob's questions. If it doesn't, it increments `res`.
   - It then checks for pairs of adjacent cells (i, i+1) to see if they can form valid scenarios:
     - If the current cell `i` appears in Bob's questions, it checks if the next cell `i+1` does not appear or appears after the last occurrence of `i`.
     - If the current cell `i` does not appear, it directly increments `res` for the pair (i, i+1).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the final count of valid scenarios using the `func_2` function, which is a custom print function to handle the output.

### Why the Program is Correct

- **Handling All Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where Alice's token is not in any of Bob's questions by counting such cells.
  - It also correctly handles the case where Alice can move to an adjacent cell that is not in Bob's questions, ensuring that the move is valid according to the problem constraints.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program uses efficient data structures (lists and tuples) to keep track of the first and last occurrences of each cell, allowing it to handle the constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^5) efficiently.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` or `k` are at their minimum or maximum values, and when the list `x` contains all possible cells or no cells.

### Conclusion

The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
