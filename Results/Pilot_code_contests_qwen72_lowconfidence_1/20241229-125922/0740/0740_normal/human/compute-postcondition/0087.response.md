Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\) and must be greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` and also do not form a consecutive sequence with any integer that appears in the list `x`. If `counter[3][0] == -1` or `counter[3][0] > counter[4][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. `i` is 3.***
