The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `x`. 

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\).
- `x` is a list of `k` integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output based on these inputs is not provided in the given context. To accurately describe the functionality, I need more information about the expected output or behavior of the function.

Given the information available, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` and `k` (positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^5\)), and `x` (a list of `k` integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n` inclusive). The function's output is not specified in the given context.**
