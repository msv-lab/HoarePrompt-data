To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
- `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
- `x` is a list of integers.
- `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`.
- `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, n)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to but not including `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `i` should start at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`**.
