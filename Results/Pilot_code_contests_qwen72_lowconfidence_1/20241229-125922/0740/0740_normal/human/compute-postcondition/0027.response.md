The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` was determined based on the condition: if the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `counter` is -1, then `res` is 2; otherwise, `res` is 1. After incrementing, the new value of `res` will be 3 if the first element was -1, or 2 if it was not -1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `i` is 3, if the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `counter` is -1, then `res` is 3, otherwise `res` is 2.**
