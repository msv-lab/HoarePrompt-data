Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`. If `counter[i][1] != -1` and (`counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]`), then `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` plus 1. Otherwise, if `counter[i][1] == -1` and (`counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]`), then `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` plus 1. In all other cases, `res` remains the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`.***
