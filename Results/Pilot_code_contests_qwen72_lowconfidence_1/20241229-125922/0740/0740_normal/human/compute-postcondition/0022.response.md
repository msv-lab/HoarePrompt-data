The `file.flush()` method is called, which ensures that all data written to `file` is actually written to the underlying file or stream. This operation does not change the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, it does affect the state of the file by ensuring that any buffered data is flushed.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'flush' and 'sep', `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of 'end' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b'\n'`, the current value of `kwargs['flush']` is True, and the buffer of `file` has been flushed.**
