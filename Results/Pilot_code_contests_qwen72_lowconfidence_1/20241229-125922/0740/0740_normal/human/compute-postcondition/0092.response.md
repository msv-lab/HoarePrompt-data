The function `func_2(res)` is called, which implies that this function might modify the value of `res` or perform operations using it. However, without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine exactly how `res` is modified or what value it returns. Assuming `func_2` does not return a value, the primary effect of this line is the potential modification of `res`.

Since we don't have the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can only assume that `res` could be modified within this function. If `func_2` modifies `res`, the new value of `res` would be whatever `func_2` sets it to. If `func_2` does not modify `res`, then `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the possible exception being the value of `res` if `func_2` changes it. Since we don't know the specifics of `func_2`, we cannot definitively state the new value of `res`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` may be modified by `func_2(res)`, `i` is `n - 1`.**
