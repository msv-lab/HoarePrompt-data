The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` (which is the third element in `args`) to the `file` object. The `file` object already contains the string representation of the second element in `args`, followed by the value of `sep`, and then the string representation of the third element in `args`. Since `at_start` is False, `file` also contains an additional `sep` after the third element.

After executing the code, the `file` object will contain the existing content followed by the string representation of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end', 'flush', and 'sep', `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, `file` contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by the value of `sep`, the string representation of the third element in `args`, an additional `sep`, and then the string representation of `x`.**
