Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'flush' and 'sep', `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of 'end' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b'\n'`. If `kwargs['flush']` was True, the buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
