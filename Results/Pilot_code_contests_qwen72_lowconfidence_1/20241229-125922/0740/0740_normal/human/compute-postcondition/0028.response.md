Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `k` is within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `i` is 3. If the first element of the tuple at index 3 in `counter` is -1, then `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2.***
