The code snippet sets `at_start` to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, there is no change in its value. The other variables (`args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `x`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end', 'flush', and 'sep', `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element in `args`, `file` contains the string representation of the second element in `args` followed by the value of `sep` (if `not at_start` is true) and then the string representation of `x`.**
