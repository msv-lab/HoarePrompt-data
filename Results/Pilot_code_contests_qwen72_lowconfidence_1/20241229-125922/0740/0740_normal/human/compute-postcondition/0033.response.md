Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`. The first occurrence of `i` in `x` is recorded in `counter[i][0]` and is not equal to -1, and the last occurrence of `i` in `x` is recorded in `counter[i][1]` and is not equal to -1. Additionally, either the first occurrence of `i + 1` in `x` is not recorded (i.e., `counter[i + 1][0] == -1`) or the first occurrence of `i + 1` in `x` is after the last occurrence of `i` in `x` (i.e., `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]`).***
