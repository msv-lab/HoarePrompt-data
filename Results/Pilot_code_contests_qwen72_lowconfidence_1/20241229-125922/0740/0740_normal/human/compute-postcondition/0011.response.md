Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end', 'flush', and 'sep', `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element in `args`, `file` contains the string representation of the second element in `args`. If `not at_start` is true, `file` additionally contains the value of `sep` following the string representation of the second element in `args`.***
