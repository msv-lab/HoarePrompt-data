Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\) and must be greater than 3, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, and `i` is 3. If `counter[4][1]` is not `-1`, then `res` remains unchanged. If `counter[4][1]` is `-1` and either `counter[3][0]` is `-1` or `counter[3][0] > counter[4][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter[3][0] == -1` or `counter[3][0] > counter[4][1]`, then `res` is incremented by 1.***
