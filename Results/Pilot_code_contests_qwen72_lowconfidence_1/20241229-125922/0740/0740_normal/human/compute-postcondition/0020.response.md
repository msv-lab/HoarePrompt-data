The code snippet `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` performs the following actions:

1. It looks for the key `'end'` in the dictionary `kwargs`.
2. If `'end'` is found, its value is removed from `kwargs` and used as the argument to `file.write()`.
3. If `'end'` is not found in `kwargs`, the default value `b'\n'` is used instead.
4. The value (either from `'end'` in `kwargs` or the default `b'\n'`) is written to the `file`.

Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `args` is a tuple of any values (unchanged).
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys `'end'`, `'flush'`, and `'sep'` (after the operation, `'end'` is removed if it was present).
- `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '` (unchanged).
- `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout` (unchanged).
- `at_start` is False (unchanged).
- `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` (unchanged, but the end-of-line character is appended).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'flush' and 'sep' (if 'end' was present, it is removed), `sep` is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `file` contains the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b'\n'`.**
