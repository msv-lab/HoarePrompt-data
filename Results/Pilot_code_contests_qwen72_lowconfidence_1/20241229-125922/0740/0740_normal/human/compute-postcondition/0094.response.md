Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` and a list `x` of `k` integers, where each integer in `x` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. It then processes the list `x` to determine the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in `x` and also do not form a consecutive sequence with any integer that appears in `x`. The result, stored in `res`, is passed to another function `func_2`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `x` is empty or when all integers from 1 to `n` are present in `x`. In these cases, `res` will be 0. Additionally, the function assumes that the input values are within the specified range and that `readlist` is a valid function for reading input lists. **
