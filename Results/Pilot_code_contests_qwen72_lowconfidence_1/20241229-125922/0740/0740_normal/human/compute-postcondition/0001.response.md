The code snippet extracts the values of 'sep' and 'file' from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method, with default values `b' '` for 'sep' and `sys.stdout` for 'file'. This means that if 'sep' or 'file' are present in `kwargs`, their values will be assigned to the respective variables and removed from `kwargs`. If they are not present, the default values will be used.

- `sep` is now set to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`.
- `file` is now set to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the keys 'sep' and 'file' if they were originally present.

The other keys in `kwargs` (if any) and the `args` tuple remain unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any values, kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush'. 'sep' is a bytes object used to separate the arguments, now equal to the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `b' '`. 'file' is a file-like object to which the output is written, now equal to the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it existed, otherwise `sys.stdout`.**
