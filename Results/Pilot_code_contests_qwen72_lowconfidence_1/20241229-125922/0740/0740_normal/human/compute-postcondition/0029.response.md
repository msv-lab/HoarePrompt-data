To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies the variables based on the provided initial state and the loop code. Let's break down the loop and its effects:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the input list, respectively, both within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`.
- `res` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if counter[i][0] == -1:
        res += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- For each `i`, the loop checks if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `counter` is `-1`.
- If the condition is true, `res` is incremented by 1.

### Output State:
- After the loop finishes, `res` will contain the count of indices `i` (from 1 to `n`) for which the first element of the tuple in `counter[i]` is `-1`.
- This means `res` will be the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
- `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
- `x` is a list of integers.
- `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`.
- `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`.**
