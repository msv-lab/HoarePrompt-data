The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, `counter`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\) and must be greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` and also do not form a consecutive sequence with any integer that appears in the list `x` plus 1, `i` is 2.**
