Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`. If `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
