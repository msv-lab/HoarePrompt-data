Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\) and must be greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` and also do not form a consecutive sequence with any integer that appears in the list `x`, and `i` is 2. If `counter[3][0] != -1`, then: 
- If `counter[2][0] == -1` or `counter[2][0] > counter[3][1]`, `res` is incremented by 1.
- If `counter[3][1] == -1`, and `counter[2][0] == -1` or `counter[2][0] > counter[3][0]`, `res` is incremented by 1.
- If none of these conditions are met, `res` remains unchanged.
If `counter[3][0] == -1`, then `res` is incremented by 1.***
