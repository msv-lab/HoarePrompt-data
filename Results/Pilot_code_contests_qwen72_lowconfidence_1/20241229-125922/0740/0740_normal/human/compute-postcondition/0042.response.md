The value of `res` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x` plus 1, and `counter[i][0]` is -1**
