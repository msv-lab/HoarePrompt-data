Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `x` is a list of integers, `counter` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `xi` (for each `xi` in `x`) is a tuple `(first_occurrence, last_occurrence)`, and `res` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that do not appear in the list `x`. If `counter[i][0]` is not -1, then: 
- If `counter[i][1]` is not -1 and either `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][1]`, `res` is incremented by 1.
- If `counter[i][1]` is -1 and either `counter[i + 1][0] == -1` or `counter[i + 1][0] > counter[i][0]`, `res` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
If `counter[i][0]` is -1, `res` is incremented by 1.***
