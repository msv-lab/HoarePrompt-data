#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(t):
    a, b, c = t
    D2 = [a + b, a + c, b + c]
    for d2 in D2:
        for d in t:
            if d2 == d:
                return 'SEGMENT'

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
    return 'TRIANGLE'
    #The program returns 'TRIANGLE'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks. It checks if the given lengths can form a triangle, a segment, or if they do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. 

- If any two stick lengths sum up to exactly one of the other stick lengths, the function returns 'SEGMENT'.
- If any two stick lengths sum up to a value less than one of the other stick lengths, the function returns `None`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns 'TRIANGLE'.

The function does not modify the input tuple `t` and only returns one of the three possible strings based on the conditions described. The function does not handle edge cases where the input tuple contains non-positive integers or values exceeding 100, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: D is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
def func_2(D):
    for t in combinations(D, 3):
        r = func_1(t)
        
        if r is not None:
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. The loop iterates through all combinations of 3 elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, `func_1(t)` is called. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, the loop returns this value immediately. If all calls to `func_1(t)` return `None`, the loop completes without returning any specific value, and the final state is that `D` remains unchanged, and no specific value is returned.
    return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    #The program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `D` of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. It iterates through all possible combinations of three elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, it calls `func_1(t)`. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, `func_2` immediately returns this value. If `func_1(t)` returns `None` for all combinations, `func_2` returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The list `D` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. Edge cases include scenarios where `func_1` always returns `None` or where the input list `D` contains duplicate values, but these do not affect the function's behavior as described.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a string used as a delimiter, defaulting to a single space (' ').
def func_3(d):
    return [int(s) for s in input.readline().strip().split(d) if len(s.strip()) > 0
    ]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from non-empty strings, split by the delimiter `d` (which defaults to a single space), from the input line read.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a delimiter `d` (defaulting to a single space ' ') and reads a line from the standard input. It splits the line by the delimiter `d`, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, filters out empty substrings, and converts the remaining substrings to integers. The function returns a list of these integers. If the input line contains only whitespace or no valid substrings, an empty list is returned. Edge cases include scenarios where the input line is empty or consists entirely of the delimiter `d`. In such cases, the function will also return an empty list.
