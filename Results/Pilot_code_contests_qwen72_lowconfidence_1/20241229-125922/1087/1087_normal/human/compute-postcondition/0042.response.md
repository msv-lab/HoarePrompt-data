Postcondition: ***`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `a`, `d2` is `a + c`. The current value of `d2` is equal to the current value of `d`, which means `a + c` is equal to `a`. Therefore, `c` must be 0, but since `c` is a positive integer, this implies a contradiction unless the definition of "positive" allows for zero.*** 

However, if we assume "positive" strictly means greater than zero, then the postcondition cannot hold as stated due to the contradiction. If "positive" includes zero, then:

Postcondition: ***`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `a`, `d2` is `a + c`. The current value of `d2` is equal to the current value of `d`, which means `a + c` is equal to `a`, implying `c` is 0.***

Given the typical definition of "positive" as greater than zero, the more precise postcondition would be:

Postcondition: ***`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `a`, `d2` is `a + c`. The current value of `d2` is equal to the current value of `d`, which means `a + c` is equal to `a`, implying a contradiction unless `c` is allowed to be zero.***
