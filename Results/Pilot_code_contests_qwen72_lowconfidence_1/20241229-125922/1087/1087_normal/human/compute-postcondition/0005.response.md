To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
- `t` is the first combination of 3 elements from `D`.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`, and `r` is `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for t in combinations(D, 3):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over all combinations of 3 elements from the list `D`. Since `D` has 4 elements, there are exactly 4 choose 3 = 4 combinations.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `D` is a list of four positive integers.
   - `t` is the first combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`, and `r` is `None`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will move to the next combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - The variable `t` will now hold the second combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - The value of `r` will be the result of `func_1(t)` for the new combination, but since we don't know the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only say that `r` will be the result of `func_1(t)` for the new `t`.

### Adjusted State:
- `D` remains the same list of four positive integers.
- `t` is now the second combination of 3 elements from `D`.
- `r` will be the result of `func_1(t)` for the new combination, but it is still `None` until the loop body is executed.

### Final State:
State: **`D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100, `t` is the second combination of 3 elements from `D`, `r` is `None`**
