To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`, each not exceeding 100.
- `D2` is a list `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- The loop iterates over each element `d2` in `D2`.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for d2 in D2:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `D2` to iterate over.
- Each element `d2` in `D2` is compared against the elements in `t`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- The loop has not yet returned 'SEGMENT' or None.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The initial state is that `t` is `(a, b, c)` and `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each element `d2` in `D2`.
3. **State Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `D2` must be available for iteration.

### Adjusting the State:
- After the previous iteration, the loop has processed one element `d2` from `D2`.
- The next element in `D2` will be the next value in the list.

### Conclusion:
- The state does not change in terms of the values of `t` or `D2` between iterations. The only thing that changes is the current element `d2` being processed.
- Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the fact that the next element in `D2` will be processed.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, where `a` is the first element, `b` is the second element, and `c` is the third element. `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. The next element `d2` in `D2` will be processed.**
