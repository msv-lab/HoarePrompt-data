The function reads an input line, splits it by the delimiter `d`, and converts the non-empty strings into a list of integers. The functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a delimiter `d`, and return a list of integers converted from non-empty strings split by `d`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a delimiter `d` (defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a list of integers converted from non-empty strings split by `d` from the input line read.**
