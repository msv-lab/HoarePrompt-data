To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is `a`.
- `d2` is `a + c`.
- `d2` is not equal to `d`.
- `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The for loop iterates over the elements of the tuple `t`. In each iteration, the variable `d` takes the value of the current element in `t`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was `a`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `d` will take the value of the next element in `t`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Current State**: `d` is `a`.
- **Next Element**: The next element in `t` is `b` (since `t` is a tuple of three elements `(a, b, c)`).
- **Update `d`**: For the next iteration, `d` will be `b`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains the same: a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` remains the same: `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is now `b`.
- `d2` remains `a + c` (unchanged because it is not part of the loop iteration).

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `b`, `d2` is `a + c`, and `d2` is not equal to `d`. Additionally, `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
