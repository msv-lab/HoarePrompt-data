You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(t):
    a, b, c = t
    D2 = [a + b, a + c, b + c]
    for d2 in D2:
        for d in t:
            if d2 == d:
                return 'SEGMENT'
            elif d2 < d:
                return None
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
    return 'TRIANGLE'
    #The program returns 'TRIANGLE'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tuple `t` of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks. If the lengths can form a triangle, it returns 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, it alternates between returning 'SEGMENT' and `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: The program returns the string 'SEGMENT'.

Case_6: The program returns None

Case_7: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_8: The program returns None

Case_9: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_10: The program returns None

Case_11: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_12: The program returns None

Case_13: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_14: The program returns None

Case_15: The program returns 'SEGMENT'

Case_16: The program returns None

Case_17: The program returns the string 'SEGMENT'.

Case_18: The program returns None

Case_19: The program returns 'TRIANGLE'


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
