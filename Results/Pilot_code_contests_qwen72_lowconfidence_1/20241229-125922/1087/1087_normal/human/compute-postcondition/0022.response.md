To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- The next element `d2` in `D2` will be processed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Tuple `t`**: The loop iterates over the elements of the tuple `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must contain at least one element.
2. **Elements of `t`**: Since `t` is defined as a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), it already contains three elements.
3. **Initial State of `d`**: Before the loop starts, `d` is not defined. The loop will assign the first element of `t` to `d` on the first iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The tuple `t` must have at least one element for the loop to execute. In this case, `t` is already defined as a tuple of three elements (a, b, c), so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
- The variable `d` is not defined before the loop starts, but it will be assigned the value of the first element of `t` when the loop begins.

### Final State:
Since `t` is already defined and contains three elements, and `d` will be assigned the first element of `t` on the first iteration, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is not defined yet but will be assigned the first element of `t` on the first iteration**
