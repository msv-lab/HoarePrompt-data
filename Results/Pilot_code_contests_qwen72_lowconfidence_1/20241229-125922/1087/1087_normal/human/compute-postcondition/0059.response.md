Output State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.**
