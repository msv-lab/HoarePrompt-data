The code assigns the result of `func_1(t)` to the variable `r`. Since `t` is the third combination of 3 elements from `D`, and assuming `func_1` is a function that processes `t` in some way, the value of `r` will be the result of this processing. The initial state specifies that `D` remains unchanged and `t` is the third combination of 3 elements from `D`.

Output State: **`D` remains unchanged as it is the input list, `t` is the third combination of 3 elements from `D`, `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`.**
