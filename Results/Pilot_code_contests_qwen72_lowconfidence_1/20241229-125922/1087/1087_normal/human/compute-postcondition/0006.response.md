The value of `r` is updated to the result of `func_1(t)`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `t`, which is the second combination of 3 elements from the list `D`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `r`, but we know that `r` now holds the return value of `func_1(t)`. The other variables (`D` and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100, `t` is the second combination of 3 elements from `D`, `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`**
