To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` is a list `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is `b`.
- `d2` is `a + c`.
- The program checks if `d2` equals `d`. If true, it returns 'SEGMENT'.
- If `d2` is not equal to `d` and `d2` is less than `d`, the program returns `None`.
- Otherwise, the program continues with the initial conditions unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a tuple `(a, b, c)`.
   - `d` is `b`.
   - `d2` is `a + c`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the tuple `t`.
   - After the first iteration, `d` was set to `b`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - The next value of `d` will be the next element in the tuple `t`.
   - Since `d` was `b` in the previous iteration, the next value of `d` will be `c`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable that changes is `d`, which moves to the next element in the tuple.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `D2`, and `d2`) remain unchanged.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains the same: `(a, b, c)`.
- `d` is now `c`.
- `d2` remains `a + c`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `c`, and `d2` is `a + c`.**
