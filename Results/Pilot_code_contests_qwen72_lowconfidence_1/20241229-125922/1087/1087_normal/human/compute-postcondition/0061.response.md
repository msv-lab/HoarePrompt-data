The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks. Based on the given cases, the function returns different values depending on the input:

- If the lengths of the sticks can form a triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side), the function returns 'TRIANGLE'.
- In all other cases where the sticks do not form a triangle, the function alternates between returning 'SEGMENT' and `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` and determine if the lengths of the sticks can form a triangle. If they can, it returns 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, it alternates between returning 'SEGMENT' and `None`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `t` of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks. If the lengths can form a triangle, it returns 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, it alternates between returning 'SEGMENT' and `None`.**
