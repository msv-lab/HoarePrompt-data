To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
   - `t` is the second combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`.
   - If `r` is not None, the program returns the result of `func_1(t)`. Otherwise, the program does not return a specific value.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for t in combinations(D, 3):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over all possible combinations of 3 elements from the list `D`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was the second combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be set to the next (third) combination of 3 elements from `D`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The combination `t` should now represent the third combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - The result `r` of `func_1(t)` will be recalculated for this new combination.

5. **Final State:**
   - `D` remains unchanged as it is the input list.
   - `t` is now the third combination of 3 elements from `D`.
   - `r` will be the result of `func_1(t)` for this new combination.

State: **`D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100, `t` is the third combination of 3 elements from `D`, `r` is the result of `func_1(t)`. If `r` is not None, the program returns the result of `func_1(t)`. Otherwise, the program does not return a specific value.**
