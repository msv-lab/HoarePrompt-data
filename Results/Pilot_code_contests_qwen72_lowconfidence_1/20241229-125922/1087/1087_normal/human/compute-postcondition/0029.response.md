To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information and the loop structure:

- **Initial State**: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`, each not exceeding 100.
- **`D2`**: Is a list `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- **`d`**: Initially not defined, but on the first iteration, it is assigned the first element of `t`.
- **Condition**: `D2` is not equal to `d`, and `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.

Given the loop:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Iteration**:
   - `d` is assigned the first element of `t`, which is `a`.
   - The state at the end of the first iteration is:
     - `t` remains `(a, b, c)`.
     - `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
     - `d` is now `a`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop will proceed to the next element in `t`, which is `b`.
   - Therefore, `d` will be assigned the value `b`.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `t` remains `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is now `b`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `b`, and `D2` is not equal to `d`. Additionally, `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
