To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is the last element of `t` (i.e., `c`).
- `d2` is the current element from `D2` being processed in the loop.
- `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for d2 in D2:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d2` was the current element from `D2` and it was greater than or equal to `d`.
2. **Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to the next element in `D2` if there are more elements left in `D2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`d2`**: The value of `d2` needs to be updated to the next element in `D2`.
- **`d`**: The value of `d` remains the same as it is defined by the tuple `t` and does not change within the loop.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:
- The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `D2` to process.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` remains `c`.
- `d2` is now the next element in `D2`.

Since `D2` contains exactly three elements, the loop will execute up to three times. After the first iteration, `d2` will be the second element in `D2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is the last element of `t` (i.e., `c`), and `d2` is the second element in `D2` (i.e., `a + c`)**.
