Output State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, where `a` is the first element, `b` is the second element, and `c` is the third element. `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, either the program has returned 'SEGMENT' if any element `d` in `t` is equal to any element in `D2`, or the program has returned None if any element `d` in `t` is less than any element in `D2`. If the loop completes without returning, `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]` and no element in `t` is equal to or less than any element in `D2`.**
