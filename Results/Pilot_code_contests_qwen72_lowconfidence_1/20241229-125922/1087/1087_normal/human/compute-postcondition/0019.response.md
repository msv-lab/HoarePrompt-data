Postcondition: ***`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, where `a` is the first element, `b` is the second element, and `c` is the third element. `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, and `d` is the third element of `t` (which is `c`). If `d2` (which is `b + c`) is equal to `d` (which is `c`), the program returns the string 'SEGMENT'. If `d2` (which is `b + c`) is not equal to `d` (which is `c`), the program returns None.***
