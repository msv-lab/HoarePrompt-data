Postcondition: ***The only variable that changes is `d`, which moves to the next element in the tuple, now `c`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `D2`, and `d2`) remain unchanged. If `d2 == d`, the program returns the string 'SEGMENT'. If `d2 < d`, the program returns None. Otherwise, `d` is now `c`, and `d2` remains `a + c`.***
