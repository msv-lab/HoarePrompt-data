To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers `(a, b, c)`, each not exceeding 100.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is `b`.
- `D2` is not equal to `d`.
- `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.
  - If `d2` is equal to `d`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'.
  - If `d2` is greater than `d`, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.
  - If `d2` is less than `d`, the program returns None.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the tuple `t`. Since `t` is a tuple of three elements `(a, b, c)`, the loop will execute up to three times.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is `b`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be the next element in the tuple `t`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Current State**: `t` is `(a, b, c)`, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `b`, and `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.
- **Next Iteration**: The next element in the tuple `t` is `c`. Therefore, `d` should be updated to `c`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same tuple `(a, b, c)`.
- `D2` remains the same list `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is now `c`.
- The condition `d2` being greater than or equal to `d` must still hold for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `c`, and `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`.**
