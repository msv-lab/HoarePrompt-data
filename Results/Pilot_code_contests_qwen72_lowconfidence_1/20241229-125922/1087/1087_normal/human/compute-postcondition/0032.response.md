Postcondition: ***`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `b`, and `D2` is not equal to `d`. Additionally, `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`. If `d2` is less than `d`, the program returns None. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as described in the precondition.***
