To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100.
- `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
- `d` is the last element of `t` (i.e., `c`).
- `d2` is the second element in `D2` (i.e., `a + c`).

### For Loop:
```python
for d in t:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the tuple `t` is not empty. Since `t` is defined as a tuple of three positive integers, it is guaranteed to have elements.
2. **Initial State of `d`**: Before the loop starts, `d` is the last element of `t`, which is `c`.
3. **Iteration Variable `d`**: Inside the loop, `d` will take on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` in sequence.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`d`**: The variable `d` should be adjusted to reflect the current element being iterated over in the tuple `t`. Initially, `d` should be set to the first element of `t` (i.e., `a`).
- **`D2` and `d2`**: These values are derived from the elements of `t` and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is `a`, `d2` is `a + c`**
