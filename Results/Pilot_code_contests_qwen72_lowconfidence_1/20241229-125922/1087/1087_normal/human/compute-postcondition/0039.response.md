Output State: **`t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`, `d` is the last element of `t` (i.e., `c`), and `d2` is greater than or equal to `d`. If `d2` is equal to any element of `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If `d2` is less than any element of `t`, the program returns None. If the loop does not execute, `d` remains undefined, and the program returns None.**
