Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling (`func_3`)**:
   - The function `func_3` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This correctly handles the input format specified in the problem description, which states that the input will contain four space-separated positive integers.

2. **Combination Generation and Triangle Check (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` generates all combinations of three sticks from the four provided. It then calls `func_1` for each combination to check if a triangle or a degenerate triangle can be formed.
   - If `func_1` returns a non-None value (either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SEGMENT'), `func_2` immediately returns that value. If all combinations result in `func_1` returning `None`, `func_2` returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. This correctly implements the logic for determining the possibility of forming a triangle or a degenerate triangle.

3. **Triangle and Degenerate Triangle Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a tuple of three stick lengths and checks if they can form a triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - It uses the triangle inequality theorem to check for a non-degenerate triangle. If any two sides sum to exactly the third side, it returns 'SEGMENT'. If any two sides sum to less than the third side, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.
   - This function correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including the formation of a non-degenerate triangle, a degenerate triangle, and the impossibility of forming any triangle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the following edge cases:
     - **Non-degenerate Triangle**: If the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.
     - **Degenerate Triangle**: If the sum of any two sides is equal to the third side, it returns 'SEGMENT'.
     - **Impossible Triangle**: If the sum of any two sides is less than the third side for all combinations, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

5. **Examples**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:
     - **Input: 4 2 1 3** -> Output: TRIANGLE
     - **Input: 7 2 2 4** -> Output: SEGMENT
     - **Input: 3 5 9 1** -> Output: IMPOSSIBLE

Given that the code correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, the correctness of the program is confirmed as **True**.
