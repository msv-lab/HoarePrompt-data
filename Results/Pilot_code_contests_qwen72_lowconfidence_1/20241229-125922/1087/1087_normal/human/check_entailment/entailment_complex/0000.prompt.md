You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she came home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task that her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to construct a triangle out of four sticks of different colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne has perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same.

The boy answered that he would cope with it without any difficulty. However, after a while he found out that different tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible to construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is impossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he does not want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated positive integer numbers not exceeding 100 â€” lengthes of the sticks.

Output

Output TRIANGLE if it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle. Output SEGMENT if the first case cannot take place and it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. Output IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct any triangle. Remember that you are to use three sticks. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length.

Annotated Functions:
import sys
from itertools import combinations

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
D = func_3()
a = func_2(D)
output.write('%s\n' % a)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(t):
    a, b, c = t
    D2 = [a + b, a + c, b + c]
    for d2 in D2:
        for d in t:
            if d2 == d:
                return 'SEGMENT'
            elif d2 < d:
                return None
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
    return 'TRIANGLE'
    #The program returns 'TRIANGLE'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks. It checks if the given lengths can form a triangle, a segment, or if they do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. 

- If any two stick lengths sum up to exactly one of the other stick lengths, the function returns 'SEGMENT'.
- If any two stick lengths sum up to a value less than one of the other stick lengths, the function returns `None`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns 'TRIANGLE'.

The function does not modify the input tuple `t` and only returns one of the three possible strings based on the conditions described. The function does not handle edge cases where the input tuple contains non-positive integers or values exceeding 100, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: D is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
def func_2(D):
    for t in combinations(D, 3):
        r = func_1(t)
        
        if r is not None:
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. The loop iterates through all combinations of 3 elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, `func_1(t)` is called. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, the loop returns this value immediately. If all calls to `func_1(t)` return `None`, the loop completes without returning any specific value, and the final state is that `D` remains unchanged, and no specific value is returned.
    return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    #The program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list `D` of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. It iterates through all possible combinations of three elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, it calls `func_1(t)`. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, `func_2` immediately returns this value. If `func_1(t)` returns `None` for all combinations, `func_2` returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The list `D` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. Edge cases include scenarios where `func_1` always returns `None` or where the input list `D` contains duplicate values, but these do not affect the function's behavior as described.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a string used as a delimiter, defaulting to a single space (' ').
def func_3(d):
    return [int(s) for s in input.readline().strip().split(d) if len(s.strip()) > 0
    ]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from non-empty strings, split by the delimiter `d` (which defaults to a single space), from the input line read.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a delimiter `d` (defaulting to a single space ' ') and reads a line from the standard input. It splits the line by the delimiter `d`, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, filters out empty substrings, and converts the remaining substrings to integers. The function returns a list of these integers. If the input line contains only whitespace or no valid substrings, an empty list is returned. Edge cases include scenarios where the input line is empty or consists entirely of the delimiter `d`. In such cases, the function will also return an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
