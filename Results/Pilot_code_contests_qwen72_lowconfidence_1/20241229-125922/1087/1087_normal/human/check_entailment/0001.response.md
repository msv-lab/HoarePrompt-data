Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the construction of triangles based on the given lengths of sticks. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **func_1**: This function checks if a given set of three stick lengths can form either a non-degenerate triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - It first calculates the sum of each pair of stick lengths.
   - It then checks if any of these sums equal one of the stick lengths (which would form a degenerate triangle).
   - If none of the sums equal a stick length, it checks if any of the sums are less than a stick length (which would mean it is impossible to form a triangle).
   - If neither condition is met, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.

2. **func_2**: This function iterates over all combinations of three stick lengths from the input list.
   - For each combination, it calls `func_1` to check if it forms a valid triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - If a valid triangle or degenerate triangle is found, it returns the corresponding result.
   - If no valid or degenerate triangle is found, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

3. **func_3**: This function reads the input from the standard input and parses it into a list of integers.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs:
- It correctly identifies when a non-degenerate triangle can be formed.
- It correctly identifies when only a degenerate triangle can be formed.
- It correctly identifies when no triangle (neither non-degenerate nor degenerate) can be formed.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
