You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she came home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task that her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to construct a triangle out of four sticks of different colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne has perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same.

The boy answered that he would cope with it without any difficulty. However, after a while he found out that different tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible to construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is impossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he does not want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated positive integer numbers not exceeding 100 â€” lengthes of the sticks.

Output

Output TRIANGLE if it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle. Output SEGMENT if the first case cannot take place and it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. Output IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct any triangle. Remember that you are to use three sticks. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length.

                return 'SEGMENT'
            elif d2 < d:

    return [int(s) for s in input.readline().strip().split(d) if len(s.strip()) > 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly handles the construction of triangles based on the given lengths of sticks. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **func_1**: This function checks if a given set of three stick lengths can form either a non-degenerate triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - It first calculates the sum of each pair of stick lengths.
   - It then checks if any of these sums equal one of the stick lengths (which would form a degenerate triangle).
   - If none of the sums equal a stick length, it checks if any of the sums are less than a stick length (which would mean it is impossible to form a triangle).
   - If neither condition is met, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.

2. **func_2**: This function iterates over all combinations of three stick lengths from the input list.
   - For each combination, it calls `func_1` to check if it forms a valid triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - If a valid triangle or degenerate triangle is found, it returns the corresponding result.
   - If no valid or degenerate triangle is found, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

3. **func_3**: This function reads the input from the standard input and parses it into a list of integers.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs:
- It correctly identifies when a non-degenerate triangle can be formed.
- It correctly identifies when only a degenerate triangle can be formed.
- It correctly identifies when no triangle (neither non-degenerate nor degenerate) can be formed.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program appears to handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` accepts a delimiter `d` (defaulting to a single space ' ') and reads a line from the standard input. It splits the line by the delimiter `d`, strips leading and trailing whitespace from each resulting substring, filters out empty substrings, and converts the remaining substrings to integers. The function returns a list of these integers. If the input line contains only whitespace or no valid substrings, an empty list is returned. Edge cases include scenarios where the input line is empty or consists entirely of the delimiter `d`. In such cases, the function will also return an empty list.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
