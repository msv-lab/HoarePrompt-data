You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she came home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task that her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to construct a triangle out of four sticks of different colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne has perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same.

The boy answered that he would cope with it without any difficulty. However, after a while he found out that different tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible to construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is impossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he does not want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated positive integer numbers not exceeding 100 — lengthes of the sticks.

Output

Output TRIANGLE if it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle. Output SEGMENT if the first case cannot take place and it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. Output IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct any triangle. Remember that you are to use three sticks. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle, a degenerate triangle, or if it is impossible to construct any triangle using three out of four given sticks. Here’s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function takes a tuple `t` of three stick lengths and checks if they can form a non-degenerate triangle or a degenerate triangle.
   - It calculates the sum of each pair of stick lengths.
   - For each sum, it checks if it equals or is less than the third stick length.
   - If any sum equals the third stick length, it returns 'SEGMENT'.
   - If any sum is less than the third stick length, it returns `None`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function takes a list `D` of four stick lengths and uses combinations to generate all possible sets of three sticks.
   - For each combination, it calls `func_1` to check if the sticks can form a triangle.
   - If `func_1` returns 'SEGMENT' or 'TRIANGLE', it immediately returns that result.
   - If no valid combination is found, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input from `stdin`, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list. This function is not directly used in the logic but is provided for reading input.

The program correctly handles all potential cases:
- **Non-degenerate Triangle**: If the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
- **Degenerate Triangle**: If the sum of any two sides equals the third side.
- **Impossible**: If neither of the above conditions is met for any combination of three sticks.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program works correctly for all potential inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
from itertools import combinations

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
D = func_3()
a = func_2(D)
output.write('%s\n' % a)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(t):
    a, b, c = t
    D2 = [a + b, a + c, b + c]
    for d2 in D2:
        for d in t:
            if d2 == d:
                return 'SEGMENT'
            elif d2 < d:
                return None
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
    return 'TRIANGLE'
    #The program returns 'TRIANGLE'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: D is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
def func_2(D):
    for t in combinations(D, 3):
        r = func_1(t)
        
        if r is not None:
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. The loop iterates through all combinations of 3 elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, `func_1(t)` is called. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, the loop returns this value immediately. If all calls to `func_1(t)` return `None`, the loop completes without returning any specific value, and the final state is that `D` remains unchanged, and no specific value is returned.
    return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    #The program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a string used as a delimiter, defaulting to a single space (' ').
def func_3(d):
    return [int(s) for s in input.readline().strip().split(d) if len(s.strip()) > 0
    ]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from non-empty strings, split by the delimiter `d` (which defaults to a single space), from the input line read.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
