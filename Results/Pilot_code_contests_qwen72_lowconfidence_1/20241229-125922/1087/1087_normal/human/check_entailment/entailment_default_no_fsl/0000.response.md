Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases as required:

1. **Input Handling (`func_3`)**:
   - The function reads four space-separated positive integers from the input.
   - It correctly handles the input format and ensures that only valid integers are processed.

2. **Combination Checking (`func_2`)**:
   - The function generates all possible combinations of three sticks from the four provided.
   - For each combination, it calls `func_1` to check if the combination can form a triangle, a segment, or is impossible.
   - If any combination forms a triangle or a segment, it immediately returns the appropriate result.
   - If no combination forms a triangle or a segment, it returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

3. **Triangle and Segment Checking (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks the triangle inequality theorem for the given combination of three sticks.
   - If the sum of any two sides equals the third side, it returns 'SEGMENT'.
   - If the sum of any two sides is less than the third side, it returns `None`.
   - If the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.

The code correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including:
- Cases where a non-degenerate triangle can be formed.
- Cases where only a degenerate triangle (segment) can be formed.
- Cases where no triangle (degenerate or non-degenerate) can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code behaves as expected and meets all requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
