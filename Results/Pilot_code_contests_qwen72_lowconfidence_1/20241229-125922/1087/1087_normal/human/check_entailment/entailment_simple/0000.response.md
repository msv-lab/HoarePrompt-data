Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The `func_3` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This matches the problem's requirement of reading four space-separated positive integers.

2. **Combinations of Three Sticks:**
   - The `func_2` function generates all possible combinations of three sticks from the four input sticks using `itertools.combinations`. This ensures that all possible sets of three sticks are considered.

3. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the given three sticks can form a triangle by verifying the triangle inequality theorem. Specifically:
     - If the sum of any two sides equals the third side, it returns 'SEGMENT'.
     - If the sum of any two sides is less than the third side, it returns None.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'TRIANGLE'.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If `func_1` returns 'TRIANGLE' or 'SEGMENT' for any combination of three sticks, `func_2` immediately returns that result.
   - If no combination of three sticks can form either a non-degenerate or degenerate triangle, `func_2` returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Non-degenerate Triangle:**
  - A non-degenerate triangle is formed if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. The program correctly identifies this case and returns 'TRIANGLE'.

- **Degenerate Triangle (Segment):**
  - A degenerate triangle is formed if the sum of any two sides equals the third side. The program correctly identifies this case and returns 'SEGMENT'.

- **Impossible to Form Any Triangle:**
  - If none of the combinations of three sticks can form either a non-degenerate or degenerate triangle, the program correctly returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

### Example Cases:

- **Input: 4 2 1 3**
  - Possible combinations: (4, 2, 1), (4, 2, 3), (4, 1, 3), (2, 1, 3)
  - (4, 2, 3) satisfies the triangle inequality: 4 + 2 > 3, 4 + 3 > 2, 2 + 3 > 4
  - Output: TRIANGLE

- **Input: 7 2 2 4**
  - Possible combinations: (7, 2, 2), (7, 2, 4), (7, 2, 4), (2, 2, 4)
  - (7, 2, 4) forms a degenerate triangle: 7 = 2 + 4
  - Output: SEGMENT

- **Input: 3 5 9 1**
  - Possible combinations: (3, 5, 9), (3, 5, 1), (3, 9, 1), (5, 9, 1)
  - None of the combinations satisfy the triangle inequality or form a degenerate triangle
  - Output: IMPOSSIBLE

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
