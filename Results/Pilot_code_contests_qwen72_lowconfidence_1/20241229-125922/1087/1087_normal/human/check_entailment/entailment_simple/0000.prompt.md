You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she came home from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task that her kindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to construct a triangle out of four sticks of different colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is extra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne has perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same.

The boy answered that he would cope with it without any difficulty. However, after a while he found out that different tricky things can occur. It can happen that it is impossible to construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is impossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he does not want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains four space-separated positive integer numbers not exceeding 100 â€” lengthes of the sticks.

Output

Output TRIANGLE if it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle. Output SEGMENT if the first case cannot take place and it is possible to construct a degenerate triangle. Output IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct any triangle. Remember that you are to use three sticks. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
from itertools import combinations

input = sys.stdin
output = sys.stdout
D = func_3()
a = func_2(D)
output.write('%s\n' % a)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of three positive integers, each not exceeding 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(t):
    a, b, c = t
    D2 = [a + b, a + c, b + c]
    for d2 in D2:
        for d in t:
            if d2 == d:
                return 'SEGMENT'
            elif d2 < d:
                return None
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a tuple of three positive integers (a, b, c), each not exceeding 100, `D2` is `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`. After the loop completes, if any element in `D2` is equal to any element in `t`, the program returns 'SEGMENT'. If any element in `D2` is less than any element in `t`, the program returns None. If none of these conditions are met during the loop execution, the loop completes without returning, and `D2` remains `[a + b, a + c, b + c]`.
    return 'TRIANGLE'
    #The program returns 'TRIANGLE'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: D is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100.
def func_2(D):
    for t in combinations(D, 3):
        r = func_1(t)
        
        if r is not None:
            return r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `D` is a list of four positive integers, each not exceeding 100. The loop iterates through all combinations of 3 elements from `D`. For each combination `t`, `func_1(t)` is called. If `func_1(t)` returns a non-None value, the loop returns this value immediately. If all calls to `func_1(t)` return `None`, the loop completes without returning any specific value, and the final state is that `D` remains unchanged, and no specific value is returned.
    return 'IMPOSSIBLE'
    #The program returns 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a string used as a delimiter, defaulting to a single space (' ').
def func_3(d):
    return [int(s) for s in input.readline().strip().split(d) if len(s.strip()) > 0
    ]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from non-empty strings, split by the delimiter `d` (which defaults to a single space), from the input line read.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
