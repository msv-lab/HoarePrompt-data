Precondition: **f is a dictionary where keys are integers representing the number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), and values are tuples of five integers (l, r, Ql, Qr, weights) where 1 ≤ l, r ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Ql, Qr ≤ 104, and weights is a list of n integers (1 ≤ wi ≤ 100) representing the weights of the items.**

However, based on the provided function definition `def func_1(f):`, it seems there might be a mismatch or an error because the function expects a single argument `f`, which does not align with the problem description that suggests multiple inputs. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def min_energy_cost(n, l, r, Ql, Qr, weights):
```

Given this corrected function definition, the precondition should be:

Precondition: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), l and r are integers (1 ≤ l, r ≤ 100), Ql and Qr are integers (1 ≤ Ql, Qr ≤ 104), and weights is a list of n integers (1 ≤ wi ≤ 100).**
