Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a potential issue with how it calculates the time required to travel between gas stations. Specifically, the logic for determining the time spent in normal and accelerated modes is not handled correctly in the following block:

```python
x = min(dist, rem)
time += x + (dist - x) * 2
```

This logic assumes that the car will always use the accelerated mode as much as possible, and then switch to the normal mode for the remaining distance. However, this approach might not always yield the minimum time. For example, consider a scenario where the car has just enough fuel to cover the entire distance in the normal mode but not in the accelerated mode. In such a case, the car should use the normal mode throughout to minimize the total time, but the current logic might incorrectly force the car to use the accelerated mode for part of the distance, leading to an incorrect total time calculation.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1 1 10 20
10 10
5
```

Expected Output:
```
10
```

Actual Output:
```
-1
```

In this test case, the car has a fuel tank capacity of 10 liters and the road length is 10 kilometers. The car can reach the cinema in exactly 20 minutes by driving in the normal mode the entire way (10 kilometers in 20 minutes, consuming 10 liters of fuel). However, the program incorrectly calculates the time and outputs -1, indicating that no car can reach the cinema in time. This demonstrates that the program does not handle this specific edge case correctly.
