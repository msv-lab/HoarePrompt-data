You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya is currently at a car rental service, and he wants to reach cinema. The film he has bought a ticket for starts in t minutes. There is a straight road of length s from the service to the cinema. Let's introduce a coordinate system so that the car rental service is at the point 0, and the cinema is at the point s.

There are k gas stations along the road, and at each of them you can fill a car with any amount of fuel for free! Consider that this operation doesn't take any time, i.e. is carried out instantly.

There are n cars in the rental service, i-th of them is characterized with two integers ci and vi — the price of this car rent and the capacity of its fuel tank in liters. It's not allowed to fuel a car with more fuel than its tank capacity vi. All cars are completely fueled at the car rental service.

Each of the cars can be driven in one of two speed modes: normal or accelerated. In the normal mode a car covers 1 kilometer in 2 minutes, and consumes 1 liter of fuel. In the accelerated mode a car covers 1 kilometer in 1 minutes, but consumes 2 liters of fuel. The driving mode can be changed at any moment and any number of times.

Your task is to choose a car with minimum price such that Vasya can reach the cinema before the show starts, i.e. not later than in t minutes. Assume that all cars are completely fueled initially.

Input

The first line contains four positive integers n, k, s and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·105, 2 ≤ s ≤ 109, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·109) — the number of cars at the car rental service, the number of gas stations along the road, the length of the road and the time in which the film starts. 

Each of the next n lines contains two positive integers ci and vi (1 ≤ ci, vi ≤ 109) — the price of the i-th car and its fuel tank capacity.

The next line contains k distinct integers g1, g2, ..., gk (1 ≤ gi ≤ s - 1) — the positions of the gas stations on the road in arbitrary order.

Output

Print the minimum rent price of an appropriate car, i.e. such car that Vasya will be able to reach the cinema before the film starts (not later than in t minutes). If there is no appropriate car, print -1.

Output

20

Note

In the first sample, Vasya can reach the cinema in time using the first or the third cars, but it would be cheaper to choose the first one. Its price is equal to 10, and the capacity of its fuel tank is 8. Then Vasya can drive to the first gas station in the accelerated mode in 3 minutes, spending 6 liters of fuel. After that he can full the tank and cover 2 kilometers in the normal mode in 4 minutes, spending 2 liters of fuel. Finally, he drives in the accelerated mode covering the remaining 3 kilometers in 3 minutes and spending 6 liters of fuel. 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

input = func_1()
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in input().split()]
rints_2d = lambda n: [tuple(rints()) for _ in range(n)]
(n, k, s, t) = rints()
(a, g) = (sorted(rints_2d(n), key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])), sorted(rints()) + [s])
(be, en, ans) = (0, n - 1, float('inf'))
while be <= en:
    md = be + en >> 1
    (fuel, point, time) = (a[md][1], 0, 0)
    for i in range(k + 1):
        dist = g[i] - point
        rem = fuel - dist
        if rem < 0:
            time = float('inf')
            break
        else:
            x = min(dist, rem)
            time += x + (dist - x) * 2
        point = g[i]
    if time > t:
        be = md + 1
    else:
        en = md - 1
        ans = min(ans, a[md][0])
print(-1 if ans == float('inf') else ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, s, and t are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^9. ci and vi are positive integers for each car i, where 1 ≤ ci, vi ≤ 10^9. The list of gas station positions g is a list of k distinct integers, each in the range 1 to s-1.
def func_1():
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    #The program returns the readline method of a BytesIO object that was initialized with the content read from the standard input (file descriptor 0) up to the size of the file.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to a `BytesIO` object, which captures any output that would normally go to the standard output. It also registers an exit handler using `atexit.register` that writes the contents of the `BytesIO` object back to the standard output when the program exits. Finally, the function returns the `readline` method of a `BytesIO` object that is initialized with the content read from the standard input (file descriptor 0) up to the size of the file. This means that after the function is called, the caller can use the returned `readline` method to read lines from the standard input. The function effectively redirects standard output to a buffer and ensures that this buffer is written back to the standard output upon program termination.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
