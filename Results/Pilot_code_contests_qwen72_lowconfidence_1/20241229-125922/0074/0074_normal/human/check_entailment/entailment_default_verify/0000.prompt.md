You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya is currently at a car rental service, and he wants to reach cinema. The film he has bought a ticket for starts in t minutes. There is a straight road of length s from the service to the cinema. Let's introduce a coordinate system so that the car rental service is at the point 0, and the cinema is at the point s.

There are k gas stations along the road, and at each of them you can fill a car with any amount of fuel for free! Consider that this operation doesn't take any time, i.e. is carried out instantly.

There are n cars in the rental service, i-th of them is characterized with two integers ci and vi — the price of this car rent and the capacity of its fuel tank in liters. It's not allowed to fuel a car with more fuel than its tank capacity vi. All cars are completely fueled at the car rental service.

Each of the cars can be driven in one of two speed modes: normal or accelerated. In the normal mode a car covers 1 kilometer in 2 minutes, and consumes 1 liter of fuel. In the accelerated mode a car covers 1 kilometer in 1 minutes, but consumes 2 liters of fuel. The driving mode can be changed at any moment and any number of times.

Your task is to choose a car with minimum price such that Vasya can reach the cinema before the show starts, i.e. not later than in t minutes. Assume that all cars are completely fueled initially.

Input

The first line contains four positive integers n, k, s and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·105, 2 ≤ s ≤ 109, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·109) — the number of cars at the car rental service, the number of gas stations along the road, the length of the road and the time in which the film starts. 

Each of the next n lines contains two positive integers ci and vi (1 ≤ ci, vi ≤ 109) — the price of the i-th car and its fuel tank capacity.

The next line contains k distinct integers g1, g2, ..., gk (1 ≤ gi ≤ s - 1) — the positions of the gas stations on the road in arbitrary order.

Output

Print the minimum rent price of an appropriate car, i.e. such car that Vasya will be able to reach the cinema before the film starts (not later than in t minutes). If there is no appropriate car, print -1.

Note

In the first sample, Vasya can reach the cinema in time using the first or the third cars, but it would be cheaper to choose the first one. Its price is equal to 10, and the capacity of its fuel tank is 8. Then Vasya can drive to the first gas station in the accelerated mode in 3 minutes, spending 6 liters of fuel. After that he can full the tank and cover 2 kilometers in the normal mode in 4 minutes, spending 2 liters of fuel. Finally, he drives in the accelerated mode covering the remaining 3 kilometers in 3 minutes and spending 6 liters of fuel. 
Program:
```
from sys import stdin

input = func_1()
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in input().split()]
rints_2d = lambda n: [tuple(rints()) for _ in range(n)]
(n, k, s, t) = rints()
(a, g) = (sorted(rints_2d(n), key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])), sorted(rints()) + [s])
(be, en, ans) = (0, n - 1, float('inf'))
while be <= en:
    md = be + en >> 1
    (fuel, point, time) = (a[md][1], 0, 0)
    for i in range(k + 1):
        dist = g[i] - point
        rem = fuel - dist
        if rem < 0:
            time = float('inf')
            break
        else:
            x = min(dist, rem)
            time += x + (dist - x) * 2
        point = g[i]
    if time > t:
        be = md + 1
    else:
        en = md - 1
        ans = min(ans, a[md][0])
print(-1 if ans == float('inf') else ans)

def func_1():
    import os, sys, atexit
    from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
    sys.stdout = BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    return BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all the specified requirements and constraints as described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why it seems to be correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using a custom function `func_1()` which simulates reading from standard input and writing to standard output. This is necessary for the program to work within the constraints of the problem.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**: The program sorts the list of cars based on their fuel capacity and price, ensuring that the binary search can efficiently find the minimum price car that meets the requirements.

3. **Binary Search**: The binary search is implemented to find the minimum price car that can reach the cinema in time. The search is conducted on the sorted list of cars, and for each candidate car, the program checks if it can complete the journey within the given time `t`.

4. **Journey Calculation**: For each candidate car, the program calculates the total time required to travel the distance `s` using the given gas stations. It ensures that the car can refuel at the gas stations and continues the journey without running out of fuel.

5. **Time Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the time taken for each segment of the journey, considering both the normal and accelerated modes of travel. It ensures that the car does not run out of fuel and completes the journey within the allowed time `t`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when no car can complete the journey within the given time, returning `-1` in such cases.

Given the above points, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to a `BytesIO` object, which captures any output that would normally go to the standard output. It also registers an exit handler using `atexit.register` that writes the contents of the `BytesIO` object back to the standard output when the program exits. Finally, the function returns the `readline` method of a `BytesIO` object that is initialized with the content read from the standard input (file descriptor 0) up to the size of the file. This means that after the function is called, the caller can use the returned `readline` method to read lines from the standard input. The function effectively redirects standard output to a buffer and ensures that this buffer is written back to the standard output upon program termination.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
