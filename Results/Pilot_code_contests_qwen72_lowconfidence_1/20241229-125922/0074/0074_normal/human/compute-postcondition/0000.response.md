The code snippet changes the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`) to a `BytesIO` object. This means that any print statements or outputs directed to `sys.stdout` will now be captured in the `BytesIO` buffer instead of being printed to the console.

The initial state variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `ci`, `vi`, and `g`) remain unchanged. The only change is in the `sys.stdout` object.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` are positive integers where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ `s` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2·10^9. `ci` and `vi` are positive integers for each car `i`, where 1 ≤ `ci`, `vi` ≤ 10^9. The list of gas station positions `g` is a list of `k` distinct integers, each in the range 1 to `s-1`. `sys.stdout` is now a `BytesIO` object.**
