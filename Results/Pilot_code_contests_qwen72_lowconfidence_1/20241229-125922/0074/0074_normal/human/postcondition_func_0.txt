The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It sets the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to a `BytesIO` object, which captures any output that would normally go to the standard output. It also registers an exit handler using `atexit.register` that writes the contents of the `BytesIO` object back to the standard output when the program exits. Finally, the function returns the `readline` method of a `BytesIO` object that is initialized with the content read from the standard input (file descriptor 0) up to the size of the file. This means that after the function is called, the caller can use the returned `readline` method to read lines from the standard input. The function effectively redirects standard output to a buffer and ensures that this buffer is written back to the standard output upon program termination.
