n, k, s, and t are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^9. Each car is defined by two positive integers ci and vi where 1 ≤ ci, vi ≤ 10^9, representing the price and the fuel tank capacity, respectively. The positions of the gas stations, g1, g2, ..., gk, are distinct integers where 1 ≤ gi ≤ s - 1.
