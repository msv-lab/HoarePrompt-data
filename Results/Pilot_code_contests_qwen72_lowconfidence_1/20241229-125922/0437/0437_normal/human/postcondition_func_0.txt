The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. The function then processes these operations by incrementing a counter `cnt` for each '+' character and decrementing it for each '-' character. The counter `cnt` is clamped to a minimum value of 0 to prevent it from going negative. After processing all operations, the function calls another function `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`. If `n` is 0, the function will not process any operations, and `cnt` will remain 0 before calling `func_2`.
