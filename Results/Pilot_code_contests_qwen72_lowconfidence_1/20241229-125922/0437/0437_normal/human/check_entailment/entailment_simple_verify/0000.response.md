Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The primary issue lies in the use of the `func_2` function for printing the result. While the logic inside `func_1` correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones in the pile, the way `func_2` handles the output is overly complex and non-standard.

1. **Complexity and Unnecessary Features**: The `func_2` function is designed to mimic the behavior of the `print` function but with additional complexity. This includes handling binary strings, file objects, and other features that are not necessary for this simple problem. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

2. **Non-Standard Output Handling**: The `func_2` function writes to a file object, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. While this might work in some environments, it introduces potential issues and is not the standard way to print output in Python. The built-in `print` function is the standard and expected way to handle output in Python.

3. **Simpler Alternative**: A simpler and more reliable way to print the result would be to use the built-in `print` function directly. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the use of `func_2` for output is unnecessarily complex and does not align with standard Python practices. Therefore, the program is not considered correct in its current form.

To correct this, the program should use the built-in `print` function to output the result, as shown in the corrected version provided in the original assessment. This ensures that the program meets the problem description and is implemented in a clear and standard manner.
