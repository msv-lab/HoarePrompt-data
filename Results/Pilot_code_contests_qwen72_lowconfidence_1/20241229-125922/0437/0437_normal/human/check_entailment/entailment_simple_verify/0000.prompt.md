You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input

The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s_i is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, s_i is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Note

In the first test, if Vasya had 3 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 0. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is 0. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than 3, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 4. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making 4 operations the number of stones in the pile increases on 4 stones. So, the answer is 4.

In the third test, if Vasya had 1 stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 1. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 3.

from __future__ import division, print_function

#Function 1:
def func_1():

    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < 0:
            cnt = 0
    func_2(cnt)

#Function 2:

    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the `func_2` function is used to print the result, but it is not a standard way to print output in Python. The function `func_2` is designed to mimic the behavior of the `print` function but with additional complexity and unnecessary features. This makes the program more complex than necessary and introduces potential issues.

For example, the `func_2` function writes to a file object, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. However, this approach is not standard and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the file object is not properly handled or if the environment does not support the same behavior as `sys.stdout`.

A simpler and more reliable way to print the result would be to use the built-in `print` function directly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < 0:
            cnt = 0
    print(cnt)

func_1()
```

This version of the program directly prints the result using the `print` function, which is the standard and expected way to handle output in Python. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
