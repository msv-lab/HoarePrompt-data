Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes a sequence of operations (`+` for adding a stone and `-` for removing a stone) and ensures that the count of stones never goes below zero by clamping the counter `cnt` to a minimum value of 0. This approach guarantees that the minimal possible number of stones in the pile is calculated correctly, even if there are more removal operations (`-`) than addition operations (`+`) at the beginning of the sequence.

The `func_2` function is used to print the result, and it correctly handles the printing according to the provided specifications. Since the problem assumes valid input and the code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and examples, the program is correct.
