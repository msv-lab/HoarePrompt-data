Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` containing the operations.
   - This matches the problem description, which specifies that the first line contains the integer `n` and the second line contains the string `s`.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '+', it increments `cnt` by 1.
     - If the character is '-', it decrements `cnt` by 1.
   - After each operation, it ensures that `cnt` does not go below 0 by setting `cnt` to 0 if it becomes negative.
   - This logic ensures that the pile never becomes empty before a stone is taken out, which aligns with the problem's constraint.

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - After processing all operations, the program calls `func_2(cnt)` to print the final value of `cnt`.
   - The function `func_2` is a custom print function that writes the value of `cnt` to the standard output, followed by a newline character.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Initial State Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the initial state of the pile. Since the problem does not specify an initial number of stones, the program assumes an initial count of 0 and adjusts accordingly based on the operations.
  
- **Operation Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that the pile never becomes negative by clamping `cnt` to 0 whenever it would otherwise become negative. This matches the problem's requirement that the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking a stone.

- **Final Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after all operations, which is the final value of `cnt`.

### Edge Cases:

- **Empty String:**
  - If `n` is 0, the string `s` will be empty. The program correctly initializes `cnt` to 0 and does not perform any operations, resulting in the correct output of 0.
  
- **All Addition Operations:**
  - If `s` contains only '+' characters, the program correctly increments `cnt` for each addition and outputs the total number of additions.

- **All Subtraction Operations:**
  - If `s` contains only '-' characters, the program correctly decrements `cnt` for each subtraction but ensures it does not go below 0, resulting in the correct output of 0.

- **Mixed Operations:**
  - If `s` contains a mix of '+' and '-' characters, the program correctly processes each operation and clamps `cnt` to 0 when necessary, ensuring the final output is the minimal possible number of stones.

Given that the program correctly handles all specified cases and constraints, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
