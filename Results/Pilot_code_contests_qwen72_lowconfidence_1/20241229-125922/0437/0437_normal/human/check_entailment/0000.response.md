Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the `func_2` function is used to print the result, but it is not a standard way to print output in Python. The function `func_2` is designed to mimic the behavior of the `print` function but with additional complexity and unnecessary features. This makes the program more complex than necessary and introduces potential issues.

For example, the `func_2` function writes to a file object, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. However, this approach is not standard and can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the file object is not properly handled or if the environment does not support the same behavior as `sys.stdout`.

A simpler and more reliable way to print the result would be to use the built-in `print` function directly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += 1 if s[i] == '+' else -1
        if cnt < 0:
            cnt = 0
    print(cnt)

func_1()
```

This version of the program directly prints the result using the `print` function, which is the standard and expected way to handle output in Python. This ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
