Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Let's break down the functionality and verify it against the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Processing Operations:**
   - The function initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each '+', it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - For each '-', it decrements `cnt` by 1.
   - If `cnt` goes below 0, it is reset to 0. This ensures that the pile never has a negative number of stones, which is consistent with the problem's constraint that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all operations, the function calls `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`.
   - The function `func_2` prints the final value of `cnt` to the standard output, which is the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `3`, `---`
  - Process: `cnt` starts at 0, becomes -1, -2, -3, and is clamped to 0.
  - Output: `0`
  - Correct.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `++++`
  - Process: `cnt` starts at 0, becomes 1, 2, 3, 4.
  - Output: `4`
  - Correct.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2`, `-+`
  - Process: `cnt` starts at 0, becomes -1, and is clamped to 0, then becomes 1.
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `5`, `++-++`
  - Process: `cnt` starts at 0, becomes 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
  - Output: `3`
  - Correct.

The program handles all edge cases and examples correctly, ensuring that the pile never has a negative number of stones and that the minimal possible number of stones is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
