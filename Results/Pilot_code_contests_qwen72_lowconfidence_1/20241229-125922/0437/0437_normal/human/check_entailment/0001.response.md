Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the cases described in the problem statement correctly. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` representing the operations correctly.
2. **Operation Counting**: It maintains a count `cnt` of the stones in the pile. For each operation, it increments `cnt` by 1 if the operation is a '+' (adding a stone) and decrements `cnt` by 1 if the operation is a '-' (removing a stone).
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `cnt` becomes negative (which would imply an invalid state where the pile has fewer than 0 stones), it resets `cnt` to 0. This ensures that the pile never goes into a negative state, aligning with the problem's requirement that the pile should never be empty before a removal operation.
4. **Output**: The final value of `cnt` is passed to `func_2`, which prints it to the standard output.

The program correctly handles the following scenarios:
- All addition operations (`++++`): The initial count can be 0, and the final count will be the number of additions.
- All subtraction operations (`----`): The initial count must be at least the number of subtractions to avoid going negative, and the final count will be 0.
- Mixed operations (`-+`, `++-++`): The program correctly adjusts the count and ensures it never goes below 0.

Since the program handles all these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle, the program is correct.
