Final: **True**

Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` representing the operations.
2. **Operation Counting**: The program maintains a count `cnt` of the stones in the pile. It increments `cnt` by 1 for each '+' operation and decrements `cnt` by 1 for each '-' operation.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program ensures that `cnt` never goes below 0 by resetting it to 0 if it becomes negative. This aligns with the problem's requirement that the pile should never be empty before a removal operation.
4. **Output**: The final value of `cnt` is passed to `func_2`, which prints it to the standard output.

The output hints confirm that `func_2` behaves as expected, printing the final count of stones to the standard output. The hints do not indicate any issues with the function's behavior.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program correctly handles all the cases described. The original assessment of correctness is accurate because the program meets the requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
