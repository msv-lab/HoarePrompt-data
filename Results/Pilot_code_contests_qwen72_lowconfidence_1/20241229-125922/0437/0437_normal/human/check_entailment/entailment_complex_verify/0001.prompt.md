You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input

The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s_i is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, s_i is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Note

In the first test, if Vasya had 3 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 0. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is 0. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than 3, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 4. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making 4 operations the number of stones in the pile increases on 4 stones. So, the answer is 4.

In the third test, if Vasya had 1 stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 1. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had 0 stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to 3.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to handle all the cases described in the problem statement correctly. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` representing the operations correctly.
2. **Operation Counting**: It maintains a count `cnt` of the stones in the pile. For each operation, it increments `cnt` by 1 if the operation is a '+' (adding a stone) and decrements `cnt` by 1 if the operation is a '-' (removing a stone).
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `cnt` becomes negative (which would imply an invalid state where the pile has fewer than 0 stones), it resets `cnt` to 0. This ensures that the pile never goes into a negative state, aligning with the problem's requirement that the pile should never be empty before a removal operation.
4. **Output**: The final value of `cnt` is passed to `func_2`, which prints it to the standard output.

The program correctly handles the following scenarios:
- All addition operations (`++++`): The initial count can be 0, and the final count will be the number of additions.
- All subtraction operations (`----`): The initial count must be at least the number of subtractions to avoid going negative, and the final count will be 0.
- Mixed operations (`-+`, `++-++`): The program correctly adjusts the count and ensures it never goes below 0.

Since the program handles all these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_1`. Inside the function, `n` is an integer representing the number of operations (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), `cnt` remains 0.
    func_2(cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of operations, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. The function then processes these operations by incrementing a counter `cnt` for each '+' character and decrementing it for each '-' character. The counter `cnt` is clamped to a minimum value of 0 to prevent it from going negative. After processing all operations, the function calls another function `func_2` with the final value of `cnt`. If `n` is 0, the function will not process any operations, and `cnt` will remain 0 before calling `func_2`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing zero or more items of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' defaults to a space byte (b' '), 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline byte (b'\n'), and 'flush' defaults to False.

For each item in `args`, its string representation has been written to `file`, separated by `sep` if there are multiple items.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing zero or more items of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' (and no longer contains 'end' if it was present), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists or `b' '` if it does not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists or `sys.stdout` if it does not, `'end'` defaults to a newline byte (`b'\n'`), `'flush'` defaults to `False`. If `'flush'` is `True`, the file buffer associated with `file` has been flushed. `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one item, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, and the end character has been written to `file`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a tuple `args` and a dictionary `kwargs` as input. It prints the items in `args` to a specified file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space byte `b' '`), and ends the output with a specified end character (defaulting to a newline byte `b'\n'`). If the `flush` parameter in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the file buffer is flushed after writing. The function does not return any value. After execution, `args` remains unchanged, `kwargs` may have the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' removed, and the specified file (or `sys.stdout`) will contain the printed output. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where nothing is printed except the end character, and ensuring the file buffer is flushed only if explicitly requested.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
