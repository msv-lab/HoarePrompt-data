Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code provided follows the problem description accurately for every potential case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` representing the operations. This aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the input consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters.

2. **Processing Operations**: The function iterates over the string `s` and updates a counter `cnt`:
   - It increments `cnt` for each '+' character.
   - It decrements `cnt` for each '-' character.
   - If `cnt` becomes negative, it is reset to 0 to ensure the pile never has a negative number of stones.

3. **Clamping the Counter**: The condition `if cnt < 0: cnt = 0` ensures that the number of stones in the pile never goes below 0, which is consistent with the problem's requirement that the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking a stone.

4. **Outputting the Result**: After processing all operations, the final value of `cnt` is passed to `func_2`, which prints the result. This matches the problem's requirement to print the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty String**: If `n` is 0, the string `s` will be empty. In this case, `cnt` remains 0, and the program correctly outputs 0.
   - **All '+' Operations**: If `s` consists entirely of '+' characters, the program correctly outputs the number of '+' characters.
   - **All '-' Operations**: If `s` consists entirely of '-' characters, the program correctly outputs 0, as the counter is clamped to 0 whenever it would go negative.
   - **Mixed Operations**: For mixed operations, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of stones by clamping the counter to 0 whenever necessary.

Given that the code handles all these cases correctly and follows the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
