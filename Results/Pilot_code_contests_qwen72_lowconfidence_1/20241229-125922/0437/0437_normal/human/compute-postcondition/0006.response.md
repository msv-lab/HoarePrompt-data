Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least one item of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists or `b' '` if it does not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists or `sys.stdout` if it does not, 'end' defaults to a newline byte (`b'\n'`), 'flush' defaults to `False`. If `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to `file`.***
