Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes a tuple `args` and a dictionary `kwargs` as input. It prints the items in `args` to a specified file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separating them with a specified separator (defaulting to a space byte `b' '`), and ends the output with a specified end character (defaulting to a newline byte `b'\n'`). If the `flush` parameter in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the file buffer is flushed after writing. The function does not return any value. After execution, `args` remains unchanged, `kwargs` may have the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' removed, and the specified file (or `sys.stdout`) will contain the printed output. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where nothing is printed except the end character, and ensuring the file buffer is flushed only if explicitly requested. **
