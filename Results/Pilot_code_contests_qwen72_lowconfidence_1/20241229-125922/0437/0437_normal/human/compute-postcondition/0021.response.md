Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing zero or more items of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' (and no longer contains 'end' if it was present), `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists or `b' '` if it does not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists or `sys.stdout` if it does not, `'end'` defaults to a newline byte (`b'\n'`), `'flush'` is `True`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one item, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, and the end character has been written to `file`.***
