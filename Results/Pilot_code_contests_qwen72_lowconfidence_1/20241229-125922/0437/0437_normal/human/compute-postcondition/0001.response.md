The values of `sep` and `file` are updated based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If `'sep'` is in `kwargs`, its value is used; otherwise, `sep` is set to `b' '`. Similarly, if `'file'` is in `kwargs`, its value is used; otherwise, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`.

The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys if they exist.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**args is a tuple containing zero or more items of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists or `b' '` if it does not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists or `sys.stdout` if it does not, 'end' defaults to a newline byte (b'\n'), and 'flush' defaults to False.**
