Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of monsters `n` and the initial health values of the monsters `A` from standard input. It uses `input()` for `n` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` for `A`. Note that `raw_input()` is used instead of `input()` for the list of health values, which is appropriate for Python 2.

2. **Sorting the Health Values**: The program sorts the list `A` in ascending order. This ensures that the smallest health values are processed first, which is crucial for the subsequent steps.

3. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to the smallest health value in the sorted list `A`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted List**: The program iterates through the remaining elements in the sorted list `A`. For each element `a`, it calculates the remainder `m` when `a` is divided by `ans` (`m = a % ans`). If `m` is non-zero, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `m` and `ans`.

5. **Final Output**: After processing all elements, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

### Why This Works:
- **GCD Property**: The key insight is that the minimum possible final health of the last monster is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial health values. This is because each attack operation reduces the health of the attacked monster by a multiple of the attacker's health, and this process effectively reduces the problem to finding the GCD of the initial health values.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation `a % ans` ensures that we are always considering the remainder, which helps in reducing the health values step by step until we reach the GCD.
- **Minimum Value**: By updating `ans` to the minimum of `m` and `ans`, the program ensures that it always keeps track of the smallest possible value that can be the final health.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element List**: The program handles the case where there is only one monster (though the problem constraints guarantee at least two monsters).
- **Large Input Values**: The program efficiently handles large input values (up to \(10^9\)) due to the properties of the GCD and modulo operations.
- **Multiple Monsters with the Same Health**: The program correctly handles cases where multiple monsters have the same initial health value.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, and thus it is correct.
