Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads `n` (the number of monsters) and the list of their initial health values `A`. It uses `input()` for `n` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` for the health values, which is appropriate for Python 2. Note that in Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Sorting Health Values**: The program sorts the health values in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to start with the smallest health value, which helps in minimizing the final health.

3. **Finding the Minimum Possible Final Health**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with the smallest health value (`A[0]`).
   - It then iterates through the remaining health values in the sorted list.
   - For each health value `a`, it computes `m = a % ans`.
   - If `m` is not zero, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `m` and `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. The logic is sound and follows the mathematical properties of the modulo operation, ensuring that the final health is minimized as required. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
