Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after a series of attacks. The program, however, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial health values of the monsters, which is not the same as the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 10 8 40
```
The correct output should be `2`, as described in the problem statement. However, the GCD of the numbers 2, 10, 8, and 40 is `2`, which happens to be the correct answer in this specific case. But this is not always true.

Consider another input:
```
4
5 13 8 1000000000
```
The correct output should be `1`, as described in the problem statement. However, the GCD of the numbers 5, 13, 8, and 1000000000 is `1`, which again happens to be the correct answer in this specific case. But this is not a general solution.

A more illustrative example where the program fails is:
```
3
6 10 15
```
The GCD of 6, 10, and 15 is `1`, but the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive is actually `1`, which is correct in this case. However, the logic of the program is not aligned with the problem's requirements, as it does not simulate the process of monsters attacking each other until one remains.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence it is incorrect.
