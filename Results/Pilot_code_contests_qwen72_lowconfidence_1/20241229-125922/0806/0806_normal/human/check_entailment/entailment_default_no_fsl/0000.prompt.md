You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N monsters, numbered 1, 2, ..., N.

Initially, the health of Monster i is A_i.

Below, a monster with at least 1 health is called alive.

Until there is only one alive monster, the following is repeated:

* A random alive monster attacks another random alive monster.
* As a result, the health of the monster attacked is reduced by the amount equal to the current health of the monster attacking.



Find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    A = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    A.sort()
    ans = A[0]
    for a in A[1:]:
        m = a % ans
        if m != 0:
            ans = min(m, ans)
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A` and prints the result. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the GCD directly to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original integer `N`, a sorted list `A` of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), and the GCD of the elements in `A` printed to the console. Note that the function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect input formats).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
