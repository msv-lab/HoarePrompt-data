You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N monsters, numbered 1, 2, ..., N.

Initially, the health of Monster i is A_i.

Below, a monster with at least 1 health is called alive.

Until there is only one alive monster, the following is repeated:

* A random alive monster attacks another random alive monster.
* As a result, the health of the monster attacked is reduced by the amount equal to the current health of the monster attacking.



Find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

Program:

def func():
    n = input()
    A = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    A.sort()
    ans = A[0]
    for a in A[1:]:
        m = a % ans
        if m != 0:
            ans = min(m, ans)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads `n` (the number of monsters) and the list of their initial health values `A`. It uses `input()` for `n` and `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` for the health values, which is appropriate for Python 2. Note that in Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Sorting Health Values**: The program sorts the health values in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to start with the smallest health value, which helps in minimizing the final health.

3. **Finding the Minimum Possible Final Health**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with the smallest health value (`A[0]`).
   - It then iterates through the remaining health values in the sorted list.
   - For each health value `a`, it computes `m = a % ans`.
   - If `m` is not zero, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `m` and `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. The logic is sound and follows the mathematical properties of the modulo operation, ensuring that the final health is minimized as required. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = input()
    A = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    A.sort()
    ans = A[0]
    for a in A[1:]:
        m = a % ans
        
        if m != 0:
            ans = min(m, ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), `n` is an input string, `ans` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A` and prints the result. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the GCD directly to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original integer `N`, a sorted list `A` of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), and the GCD of the elements in `A` printed to the console. Note that the function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect input formats).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
