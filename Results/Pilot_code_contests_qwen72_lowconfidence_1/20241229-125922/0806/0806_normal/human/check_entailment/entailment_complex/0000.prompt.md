You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N monsters, numbered 1, 2, ..., N.

Initially, the health of Monster i is A_i.

Below, a monster with at least 1 health is called alive.

Until there is only one alive monster, the following is repeated:

* A random alive monster attacks another random alive monster.
* As a result, the health of the monster attacked is reduced by the amount equal to the current health of the monster attacking.



Find the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

Print the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = input()
    A = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    A.sort()
    ans = A[0]
    for a in A[1:]:
        m = a % ans
        
        if m != 0:
            ans = min(m, ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), `n` is an input string, `ans` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A` and prints the result. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the GCD directly to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original integer `N`, a sorted list `A` of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), and the GCD of the elements in `A` printed to the console. Note that the function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect input formats).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
