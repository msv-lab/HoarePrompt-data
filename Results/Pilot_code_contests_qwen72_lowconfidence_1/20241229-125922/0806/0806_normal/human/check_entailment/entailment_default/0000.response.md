Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum possible final health of the last monster alive after a series of attacks. The code, however, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial health values of the monsters. While the GCD is related to the problem, it does not directly solve the specific requirement of minimizing the final health of the last monster.

The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the minimum possible final health. The correct approach involves repeatedly reducing the health of the monsters until only one remains, and the goal is to minimize the final health of the last monster. The current implementation does not simulate the attack process and instead relies on a mathematical property (GCD) that does not capture the full dynamics of the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 10 8 40
```
The correct output should be `2`, as the problem description specifies. However, the GCD of the numbers `2, 10, 8, 40` is `2`, which coincidentally matches the correct output in this case. But for other inputs, the GCD approach will fail to produce the correct result.

To illustrate, consider another input:
```
4
5 13 8 1000000000
```
The correct output should be `1`, but the GCD of `5, 13, 8, 1000000000` is `1`, which again happens to be correct by coincidence. However, the GCD approach does not guarantee the correct result for all cases.

A more accurate solution would involve simulating the attack process or using a different approach that correctly handles the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.
