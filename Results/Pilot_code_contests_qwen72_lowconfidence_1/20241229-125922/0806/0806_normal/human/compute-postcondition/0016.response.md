Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), `n` is an input string, `ans` is the smallest integer in `A`, `a` is the fourth smallest integer in `A`. If `m` (which is `a % ans`) is not zero, `ans` is updated to `a % ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the smallest integer in `A`.***
