Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A` and prints the result. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the GCD directly to the console. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original integer `N`, a sorted list `A` of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), and the GCD of the elements in `A` printed to the console. Note that the function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input cases (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect input formats). **
