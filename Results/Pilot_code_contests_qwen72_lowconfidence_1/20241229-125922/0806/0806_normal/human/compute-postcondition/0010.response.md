`m` is assigned the value `a % ans`. Given that `ans` is the smallest integer in `A` and `a` is the third smallest integer in `A`, the value of `m` is calculated as `a % ans`. If `m` is not 0, it remains `a % ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), `n` is an input string, `ans` is the smallest integer in `A`, `a` is the third smallest integer in `A`, `m` is `a % ans`. If `m` is not 0, then `m` remains `a % ans`.**
