The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of `m` and the original value of `ans`. Given that `m` is `a % ans` and `m` is not 0, `m` is less than `ans` since the remainder when dividing `a` by `ans` will always be less than `ans` and non-zero. Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `m`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and \(10^9\)), `n` is an input string, `ans` is `a % ans`, `a` is the second smallest integer in `A`, `m` is `a % ans`. The current value of `m` is not 0.**
