The code snippet `A.sort()` sorts the elements in the list `A` in ascending order. Since `A` is a map object containing integers, it needs to be converted to a list before sorting, which is implicitly handled by the sort method in this context. The values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and 10^9), `n` is an input string**.
