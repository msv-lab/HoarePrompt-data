The code snippet `ans = A[0]` assigns the first element of the sorted list `A` to the variable `ans`. Since `A` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `A[0]` is the smallest integer in the list.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a sorted list of integers (each between 1 and 10^9), `n` is an input string, `ans` is the smallest integer in `A`**.
