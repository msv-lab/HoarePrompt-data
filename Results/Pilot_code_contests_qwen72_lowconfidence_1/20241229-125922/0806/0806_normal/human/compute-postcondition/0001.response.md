The code snippet `A = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts these substrings into integers, and assigns the resulting sequence of integers to the variable `A`.

Given the initial state:
- N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9
- `n` is an input string

After executing the code snippet:
- `A` is now a map object containing the integers parsed from the input string.
- The original value of `A` (a list of N integers) is replaced by this new map object.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code snippet.
- The condition on `N` and the range of integers in `A` (1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9) still holds true, assuming the input provided adheres to these constraints.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a map object containing integers parsed from the input string where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, `n` is an input string**
