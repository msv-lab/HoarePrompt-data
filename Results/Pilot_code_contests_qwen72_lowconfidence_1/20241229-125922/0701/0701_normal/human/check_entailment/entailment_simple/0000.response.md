Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly divides the \( n^2 \) labs into \( n \) groups of \( n \) labs each, such that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another is maximized. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer \( n \) from standard input. This is the only input required by the problem, and the function handles it correctly.

2. **Group Formation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list of lists `ans` to store the groups of labs.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the labs from 1 to \( n^2 \).
   - Inside the loop, a for loop is used to distribute the labs into the groups. The variable `start` is used to keep track of the starting index for each iteration of the outer loop.
   - The expression `ans[i % n].append(x)` ensures that each lab is added to the appropriate group. The modulo operation ensures that the labs are distributed cyclically among the \( n \) groups.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - After forming the groups, the program converts each lab number to a string and stores it in the `ans` list.
   - Finally, the program prints each group of labs, separated by spaces, using the `func_4()` function.

4. **Optimality of Group Division:**
   - The way the labs are distributed ensures that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another is maximized. This is achieved by distributing the labs in a cyclic manner, which balances the distribution of higher and lower numbered labs across the groups.
   - For example, if \( n = 3 \), the groups might look like:
     - Group 1: [1, 4, 7]
     - Group 2: [2, 5, 8]
     - Group 3: [3, 6, 9]
   - This distribution ensures that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between any two groups is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, forms the groups optimally, and outputs the groups in the required format. Therefore, the program is correct.
