Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are utility functions for reading input and writing output, but they do not implement the required algorithm to divide the labs into groups such that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between any two groups is maximized. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
