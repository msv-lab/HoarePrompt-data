Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from standard input, which represents the number of groups and the number of labs in each group. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Group Formation**:
   - The code initializes an empty list of lists `ans` to store the groups.
   - It then uses a while loop to iterate through the labs, starting from 1 to `n^2`.
   - For each lab, it appends the lab number to the appropriate group using modulo arithmetic (`i % n`). This ensures that the labs are distributed evenly across the groups.
   - The `start` variable is incremented after each full cycle through the groups, ensuring that the next set of labs is appended to the next set of groups.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The code converts the lab numbers in each group to strings and prints them in the required format using `func_4`.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The distribution of labs across groups is done in a way that maximizes the minimum number of units of water that can be transported between any two groups. This is achieved by the even distribution of labs using modulo arithmetic, which ensures that each group has a mix of high and low lab numbers, thus maximizing the minimum flow.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case of `n = 2` and larger values up to `n = 300` as specified in the problem constraints. The distribution method used ensures that the groups are formed correctly and optimally for all valid inputs.

Given the above points, the code appears to meet all the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
