Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are utility functions for reading input and writing output, but they do not perform the actual logic needed to divide the labs into groups and ensure the maximum minimum flow between groups.

The problem requires dividing the labs into groups such that the minimum number of units of water that can be transported from one group to another is maximized. This involves a complex algorithm that is not present in the provided code. The code does not define any logic to create the groups or calculate the flows between them, which are essential parts of the solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not address the core requirements of the problem description.
