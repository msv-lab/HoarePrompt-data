The code `sys.stdout.write('\n')` adds a newline character to the output stream. This does not alter the state of any variables in the initial state, but it does impact the output that has been generated. Given that the initial state mentions that each element in `args` has already been printed followed by a space, the addition of the newline character completes the printing process.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. Each element in `args` has been printed to `sys.stdout` followed by a space, and a newline character has been added to the end of the output. If `args` is an empty tuple, only a newline character is printed.**
