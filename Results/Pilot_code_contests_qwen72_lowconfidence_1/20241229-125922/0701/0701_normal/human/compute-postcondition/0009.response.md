Functionality: ** The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but uses a global variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. The function iterates over each element in `args`, printing each element to `sys.stdout` followed by a space. After all elements have been printed, a newline character is added to `sys.stdout`. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is printed except a single newline character. The function does not return any value. **

### Edge Cases:
- If `args` is an empty tuple, the function will only print a newline character.
- If `args` contains non-string types, they are converted to strings before being printed.
- If `args` is not defined or is not a tuple, the function will raise an error.
