The function `func_4` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but it is noted that it expects `args` to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. Since the function signature does not include `args`, it seems there might be a discrepancy. However, based on the given context, I will assume the function is intended to accept `*args`, which allows it to receive a variable number of arguments.

Given this, the function `func_4` accepts a variable number of arguments, which can be of any type. The output section is missing, so I cannot determine what the function returns. Without this information, I cannot fully describe the functionality of the function. However, I can still provide a partial description:

The function `func_4` accepts a variable number of arguments, which can be of any type. The specific return value or behavior of the function based on these inputs is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a variable number of arguments of any type. The specific return value or behavior of the function based on these inputs is not provided.**
