The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output. The variables `args` and `s` remain unchanged. Since `s` is the third element in `args`, it retains its value.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least three elements of any type, `s` is the third element in `args`**
