The code `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of `s` followed by a space to the standard output. This does not change the value of `s` or any other variables. The state of `args` and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least two elements of any type, `s` is the second element in `args`**
