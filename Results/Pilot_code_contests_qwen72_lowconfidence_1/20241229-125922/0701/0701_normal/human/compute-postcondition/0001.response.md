The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')` writes the string representation of the first element in the `args` tuple (`s`) followed by a space to the standard output.

- `args` remains a tuple containing at least one element of any type.
- `s` is the first element in `args`.
- The content of `s` is printed to the standard output, followed by a space.

The state of the variables `args` and `s` does not change, only the standard output is affected.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element of any type, `s` is the first element in `args`**
