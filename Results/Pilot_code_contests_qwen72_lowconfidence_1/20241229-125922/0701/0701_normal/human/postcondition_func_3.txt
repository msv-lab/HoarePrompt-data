The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but uses a global variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. The function iterates over each element in `args`, printing each element to `sys.stdout` followed by a space. After all elements have been printed, a newline character is added to `sys.stdout`. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is printed except a single newline character. The function does not return any value.
