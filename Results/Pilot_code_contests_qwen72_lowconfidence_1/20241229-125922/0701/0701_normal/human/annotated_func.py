#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline())
    #The program returns an integer read from standard input (stdin).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input (stdin), converts it to an integer, and returns this integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the input is a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised. If no input is provided or the input is empty, `sys.stdin.readline()` will return an empty string, which will also result in a `ValueError` when attempting to convert it to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and reads input from stdin, expecting it to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from a space-separated list of integers read from stdin into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting it to be a space-separated list of integers. It then converts each element in this list into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input is empty, the function will return a map object that iterates over an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline()
    #The program returns the next line of input from the standard input (stdin), which could be any string entered by the user followed by a newline character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from the standard input (stdin). This line can be any string entered by the user, followed by a newline character. If the end of the input stream is reached (e.g., the user signals EOF by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z depending on the operating system), the function returns an empty string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type.
def func_4():
    for s in args:
        sys.stdout.write(str(s) + ' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. After the loop finishes, each element in `args` has been printed to `sys.stdout` followed by a space. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is printed.
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters directly but uses a global variable `args`, which is expected to be a tuple containing any number of elements of any type. The function iterates over each element in `args`, printing each element to `sys.stdout` followed by a space. After all elements have been printed, a newline character is added to `sys.stdout`. If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is printed except a single newline character. The function does not return any value.
