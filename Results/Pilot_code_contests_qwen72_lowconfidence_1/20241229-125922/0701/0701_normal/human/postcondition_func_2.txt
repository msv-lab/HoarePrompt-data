The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from the standard input (stdin). This line can be any string entered by the user, followed by a newline character. If the end of the input stream is reached (e.g., the user signals EOF by pressing Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Z depending on the operating system), the function returns an empty string.
