The code snippet `s += ' ' + str(i)` appends a space followed by the string representation of `i` to the existing string `s`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so its value remains unknown. However, since `s` was initially the string representation of the length of `neg`, after the execution, `s` will be this initial string followed by a space and the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input and contains at least one negative integer, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` and has at least one element, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representation of `i`.**
