The code `zero.append(neg.pop())` removes the last element from the `neg` list and appends it to the `zero` list. Let's break down the changes:

- The last element of `neg` is removed, so the length of `neg` decreases by 1.
- The removed element is appended to `zero`, so the length of `zero` increases by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, and the length of `neg` is even.
- If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `neg` is removed and appended to `zero`.
- The length of `neg` is now odd (since it was even and we removed one element).
- The length of `zero` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a` plus the last element of `neg`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` except the last one, and the length of `neg` is odd.**
