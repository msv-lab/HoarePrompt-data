To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.
- `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in neg:
    s += ' ' + str(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `neg`.
   - For each iteration, the string `s` is updated by appending a space followed by the string representation of `i`.

2. **Initial Value of `s`**:
   - Before the loop starts, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg`.

3. **Final Value of `s`**:
   - After the loop completes, `s` will contain the initial length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representation of each negative integer in `neg`, separated by spaces.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute at least once if `neg` contains at least one element.
   - If `neg` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `s` will remain the string representation of the length of `neg`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.
- `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representations of all elements in `neg`, separated by spaces.

If `neg` is empty, `s` will be the string representation of the length of `neg` (which is "0").

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representations of all elements in `neg`, separated by spaces.**
