Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, and `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`. If the length of `neg` is even, the last element of `neg` is removed and appended to `zero`, making the length of `neg` odd and the length of `zero` increased by 1. If the length of `neg` is odd, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged. If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.***
