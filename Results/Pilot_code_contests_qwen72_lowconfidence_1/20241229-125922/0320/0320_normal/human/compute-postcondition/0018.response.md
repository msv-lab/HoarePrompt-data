The code snippet appends a space followed by the string representation of the current value of `i` to the string `s`.

- `s` initially contains the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space, the string representation of the new `i`, and another space.
- After executing the code, `s` will contain the initial part followed by another space and the string representation of `i`.

Therefore, the updated value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus an additional space and the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input and contains at least one negative integer, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` and has at least one element, `i` is the next negative integer in the list `neg`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space, the string representation of the new `i`, another space, and another space followed by the string representation of `i`.**
