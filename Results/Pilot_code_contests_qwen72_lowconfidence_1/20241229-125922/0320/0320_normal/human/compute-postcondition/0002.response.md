The code creates a new list `zero` that contains all elements from the list `a` that are equal to 0. The variables `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.**
