Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `zero` followed by a space-separated string of all zeros in `zero`. If `zero` is an empty list, `s` remains the string representation of the length of `zero`.**
