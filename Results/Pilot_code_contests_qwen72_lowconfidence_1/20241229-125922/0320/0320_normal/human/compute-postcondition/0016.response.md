The code concatenates a space and the string representation of the next negative integer `i` from the list `neg` to the existing string `s`.

- `s` was originally the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representation of the new `i`.
- Now, `s` will have an additional space followed by the string representation of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input and contains at least one negative integer, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` and has at least one element, `i` is the next negative integer in the list `neg`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space, the string representation of the new `i`, and another space followed by the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input and contains at least one negative integer, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` and has at least one element, `i` is the next negative integer in the list `neg`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space, the string representation of the new `i`, and another space followed by the string representation of `i`.**
