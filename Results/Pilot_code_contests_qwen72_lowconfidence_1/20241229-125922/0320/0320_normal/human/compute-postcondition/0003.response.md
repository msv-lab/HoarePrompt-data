The code snippet creates a new list `pos` which contains only the positive integers from the list `a`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `a`, and `zero` remain unchanged. The list `pos` will contain all elements from `a` that are greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.**
