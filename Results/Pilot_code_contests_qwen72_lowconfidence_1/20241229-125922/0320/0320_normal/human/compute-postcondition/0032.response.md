The code snippet `s += ' ' + str(i)` modifies the variable `s`. Initially, `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos`. After executing the code, `s` will be updated to include a space followed by the string representation of the integer `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers
- `a` is a list of integers read from input
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a` and must have at least one element
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`
- `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos` followed by a space and the string representation of `i`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a` and must have at least one element, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos` followed by a space and the string representation of `i`**
