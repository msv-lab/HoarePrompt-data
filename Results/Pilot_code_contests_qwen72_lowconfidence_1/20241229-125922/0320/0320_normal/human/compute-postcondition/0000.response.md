The value of `n` is assigned the integer value obtained from the user input through `raw_input()`. The function `divide_array` and its parameters remain unchanged, and the list `arr` is not affected. Since `n` is now specifically defined by the user input, the output state includes this updated value.

Output State: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def divide_array(n, arr):` where `n` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies |a_i| ≤ 103.**
