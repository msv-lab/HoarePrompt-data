The code `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state, the function `divide_array(n, arr)` is expected to receive two parameters: `n` and `arr`. However, the code snippet provided reads new input and assigns it to `a`, which suggests that `a` will now contain the list of integers read from the input. Since `raw_input()` is used, this is compatible with Python 2, and the input is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.

The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 3 and 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers. After executing the code snippet, the variable `a` will contain a list of integers from the input, and the original variables `n` and `arr` are not directly affected by this code snippet unless they are intended to be reassigned based on the input, which is not shown here.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input**.
