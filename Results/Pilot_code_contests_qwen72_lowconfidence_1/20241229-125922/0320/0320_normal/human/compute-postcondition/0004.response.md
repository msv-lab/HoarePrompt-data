The code snippet creates a new list `neg` that contains all the elements from `a` that are less than 0 (negative integers). The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `a`, `zero`, `pos`) remain unchanged.

Since `a` is a list of integers read from input, and `neg` filters out only the negative integers from `a`, the length of `neg` will be the number of negative integers in `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.**
