The code snippet appends the string representation of `i` to the string `s`, which already contains the length of `zero` followed by a space and the string representation of the current `i`. After this operation, `s` will contain the original part plus an additional space and the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a` and must have at least two zeros, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `i` is the next zero in the `zero` list, `s` is the string representation of the length of `zero` followed by a space and the string representation of the new `i` followed by another space and the string representation of `i`**
