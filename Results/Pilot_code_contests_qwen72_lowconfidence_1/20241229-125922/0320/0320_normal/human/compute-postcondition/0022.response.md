To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.
- `s` is the string representation of the length of `zero`.

Loop Statement:
```python
for i in zero:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute, the list `zero` must contain at least one element (i.e., there must be at least one zero in the list `a`). If `zero` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `zero` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a` and must have at least one zero, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `zero`.**
