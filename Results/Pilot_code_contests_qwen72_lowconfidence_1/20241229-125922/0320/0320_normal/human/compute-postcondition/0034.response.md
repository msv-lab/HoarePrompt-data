The code appends a space followed by the string representation of `i` to the existing string `s`. The value of `s` is updated to include this additional information.

- `s` was originally the string representation of the length of `pos` followed by a space and the string representation of the new `i`.
- After executing the code, `s` now includes an additional space and the string representation of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a` and must have at least one element, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `i` is the next element in `pos`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos` followed by a space, the string representation of the new `i`, and another space followed by the string representation of `i`.**
