To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the elements in the `pos` list, so the primary condition for the loop to execute is that `pos` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the given state and the loop:

- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.
- `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos`.

The loop:
```python
for i in pos:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute:
- `pos` must contain at least one element. This means there must be at least one positive integer in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `pos` is not empty. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a` and must have at least one element, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos`**.
