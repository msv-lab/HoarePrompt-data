The code `pos.append(neg.pop())` has the following effects:

- The last element of `neg` is removed and appended to `pos`.
- The length of `neg` is decreased by 1.
- The length of `pos` is now 1, and it contains the last element that was in `neg`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
- `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, and its length is 0.
- `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`.
- The length of `neg` is decreased by 1.
- The length of `pos` is now 1, and it contains the last element that was in `neg`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing the last element from `neg`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` except the last one.**
