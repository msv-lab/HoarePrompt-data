To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
   - `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
   - `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`.
   - `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in neg:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `neg` is not an empty list. This means there must be at least one negative integer in `a`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure that `neg` contains at least one element. This can be achieved by ensuring that `a` contains at least one negative integer.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from input, and it must contain at least one negative integer.
   - `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`.
   - `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`.
   - `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, and it must have at least one element.
   - `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must contain at least one negative integer, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a` and must have at least one element, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg`**.
