You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitaly has an array of n distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: 

  1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0). 
  2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0). 
  3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero. 
  4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. 



Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103) — the array elements.

Output

In the first line print integer n1 (n1 > 0) — the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers — the elements that got to the first set.

In the next line print integer n2 (n2 > 0) — the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers — the elements that got to the second set.

In the next line print integer n3 (n3 > 0) — the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers — the elements that got to the third set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

    pos = [i for i in a if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in a if i < 0]
    if len(pos) == 0:
        pos.append(neg.pop())
        pos.append(neg.pop())
    if len(neg) % 2 == 0:
        zero.append(neg.pop())
    s = str(len(neg))
    for i in neg:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(zero))
    for i in zero:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(pos))
    for i in pos:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are no positive numbers and only one negative number in the array. In such a case, the program attempts to pop two elements from the `neg` list, which will raise an error because there is only one negative number.

Example:
Input:
```
3
-1 2 0
```

The program will attempt to move two elements from `neg` to `pos`, but since there is only one negative number, this will fail. The correct behavior would be to ensure that the single negative number is placed in the first set, the positive number in the second set, and the zero in the third set.

This is a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then categorizes these integers into three lists: `zero` (containing all zeros), `pos` (containing all positive integers), and `neg` (containing all negative integers). If there are no positive integers, it moves the last two negative integers to the `pos` list. If the number of negative integers is even, it moves the last negative integer to the `zero` list. Finally, it prints three lines: the first line contains the count and elements of the `neg` list, the second line contains the count and elements of the `zero` list, and the third line contains the count and elements of the `pos` list. The function ensures that the `pos` list always contains at least one element. Edge cases include scenarios where the input list has no positive integers or an even number of negative integers, which are handled as described. However, the function does not ensure that the subarrays are contiguous, as stated in the return postconditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
