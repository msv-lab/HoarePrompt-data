Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are no positive numbers and only one negative number in the array. In such a case, the program attempts to pop two elements from the `neg` list, which will raise an error because there is only one negative number.

Example:
Input:
```
3
-1 2 0
```

The program will attempt to move two elements from `neg` to `pos`, but since there is only one negative number, this will fail. The correct behavior would be to ensure that the single negative number is placed in the first set, the positive number in the second set, and the zero in the third set.

This is a specific case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
