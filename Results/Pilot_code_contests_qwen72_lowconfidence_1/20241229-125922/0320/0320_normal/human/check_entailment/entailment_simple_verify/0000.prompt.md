You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitaly has an array of n distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: 

  1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0). 
  2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0). 
  3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero. 
  4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. 



Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103) — the array elements.

Output

In the first line print integer n1 (n1 > 0) — the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers — the elements that got to the first set.

In the next line print integer n2 (n2 > 0) — the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers — the elements that got to the second set.

In the next line print integer n3 (n3 > 0) — the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers — the elements that got to the third set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    zero = [i for i in a if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in a if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in a if i < 0]
    if len(pos) == 0:
        pos.append(neg.pop())
        pos.append(neg.pop())
    if len(neg) % 2 == 0:
        zero.append(neg.pop())
    s = str(len(neg))
    for i in neg:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(zero))
    for i in zero:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(pos))
    for i in pos:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has only one negative number and no positive numbers. In such a scenario, the program will attempt to move two negative numbers to the positive set, which is not possible since there is only one negative number. This leads to an incorrect partitioning of the array, violating the requirement that each number must occur in exactly one set.

Example Input:
```
3
-1 0 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 -1
1 2
1 0
```

Actual Output (due to the bug):
```
1 -1
2 -1 2
1 0
```

This output is incorrect because the number `-1` appears in both the first and second sets.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def divide_array(n, arr):` where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies |a_i| ≤ 103.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    zero = [i for i in a if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in a if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in a if i < 0]
    if (len(pos) == 0) :
        pos.append(neg.pop())
        pos.append(neg.pop())

If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.

If the length of `neg` is even, the last element of `neg` is removed and appended to `zero`, making the length of `neg` odd and the length of `zero` increased by 1. If the length of `neg` is odd, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged. If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
