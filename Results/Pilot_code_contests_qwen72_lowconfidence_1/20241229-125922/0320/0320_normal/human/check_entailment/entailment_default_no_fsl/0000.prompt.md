You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vitaly has an array of n distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: 

  1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0). 
  2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0). 
  3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero. 
  4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. 



Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103) — the array elements.

Output

In the first line print integer n1 (n1 > 0) — the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers — the elements that got to the first set.

In the next line print integer n2 (n2 > 0) — the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers — the elements that got to the second set.

In the next line print integer n3 (n3 > 0) — the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers — the elements that got to the third set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    zero = [i for i in a if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in a if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in a if i < 0]
    if len(pos) == 0:
        pos.append(neg.pop())
        pos.append(neg.pop())
    if len(neg) % 2 == 0:
        zero.append(neg.pop())
    s = str(len(neg))
    for i in neg:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(zero))
    for i in zero:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)
    s = str(len(pos))
    for i in pos:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
    print(s)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then categorizes these integers into three lists: `zero` (containing all zeros), `pos` (containing all positive integers), and `neg` (containing all negative integers). If there are no positive integers, it moves the last two negative integers to the `pos` list. If the number of negative integers is even, it moves the last negative integer to the `zero` list. Finally, it prints three lines: the first line contains the count and elements of the `neg` list, the second line contains the count and elements of the `zero` list, and the third line contains the count and elements of the `pos` list. The function ensures that the `pos` list always contains at least one element. Edge cases include scenarios where the input list has no positive integers or an even number of negative integers, which are handled as described. However, the function does not ensure that the subarrays are contiguous, as stated in the return postconditions.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
