Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has only one negative number and no positive numbers. In such a scenario, the program will attempt to move two negative numbers to the positive set, which is not possible since there is only one negative number. This leads to an incorrect partitioning of the array, violating the requirement that each number must occur in exactly one set.

Example Input:
```
3
-1 0 2
```

Expected Output:
```
1 -1
1 2
1 0
```

Actual Output (due to the bug):
```
1 -1
2 -1 2
1 0
```

This output is incorrect because the number `-1` appears in both the first and second sets.
