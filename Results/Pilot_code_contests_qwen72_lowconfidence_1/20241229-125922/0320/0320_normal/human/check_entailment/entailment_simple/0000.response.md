Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` does not take any parameters, whereas according to the problem description, it should take two parameters: `n` (the number of elements) and `arr` (the list of integers). The correct function signature should be `def divide_array(n, arr):`.

2. **Input Handling**: The current program reads input directly using `raw_input()`, which is not consistent with the function signature expected in the problem description. The function should take the input as parameters and not read from standard input.

3. **Handling of Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - The logic for handling positive and negative numbers is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if (len(pos) == 0)` is used to ensure that the second set has a positive product. However, moving two negative numbers to the positive set might not always result in a positive product, especially if there are no positive numbers in the input array.
   - The condition `if (len(neg) % 2 == 0)` ensures that the product of the negative set is negative by moving one negative number to the zero set. This is correct, but it assumes that there are enough negative numbers to make this move.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct in terms of printing the lengths and elements of the sets. However, the function should return the sets or print them directly if it is designed to do so.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the input array might have only one positive or negative number, which could lead to incorrect partitioning.

To correct the program, it should be modified to accept parameters, handle the partitioning logic correctly, and ensure that the output format matches the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def divide_array(n, arr):
    zero = [i for i in arr if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in arr if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in arr if i < 0]
    
    if len(pos) == 0:
        if len(neg) >= 2:
            pos.append(neg.pop())
            pos.append(neg.pop())
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot form the required sets with the given input.")
    
    if len(neg) % 2 == 0:
        zero.append(neg.pop())
    
    print(len(neg), *neg)
    print(len(pos), *pos)
    print(len(zero), *zero)

# Example usage:
# n = 4
# arr = [-1, -2, -3, 0]
# divide_array(n, arr)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The function takes the correct parameters.
- The partitioning logic is handled correctly to meet the problem's requirements.
- The output format is correct and matches the problem description.
