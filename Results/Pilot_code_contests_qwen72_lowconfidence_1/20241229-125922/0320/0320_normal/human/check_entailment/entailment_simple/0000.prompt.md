You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vitaly has an array of n distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: 

  1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0). 
  2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0). 
  3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero. 
  4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. 



Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103) — the array elements.

Output

In the first line print integer n1 (n1 > 0) — the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers — the elements that got to the first set.

In the next line print integer n2 (n2 > 0) — the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers — the elements that got to the second set.

In the next line print integer n3 (n3 > 0) — the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers — the elements that got to the third set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def divide_array(n, arr):` where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies |a_i| ≤ 103.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    zero = [i for i in a if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in a if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in a if i < 0]
    if (len(pos) == 0) :
        pos.append(neg.pop())
        pos.append(neg.pop())
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, and `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`. If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.
    if (len(neg) % 2 == 0) :
        zero.append(neg.pop())
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, and `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`. If the length of `neg` is even, the last element of `neg` is removed and appended to `zero`, making the length of `neg` odd and the length of `zero` increased by 1. If the length of `neg` is odd, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged. If the length of `pos` is 0, the last element of `neg` is moved to `pos`, and the length of `neg` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the lists `pos` and `neg` remain unchanged.
    s = str(len(neg))
    for i in neg:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `neg` followed by a space and the string representations of all elements in `neg`, separated by spaces.
    print(s)
    s = str(len(zero))
    for i in zero:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a`, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `zero` followed by a space-separated string of all zeros in `zero`. If `zero` is an empty list, `s` remains the string representation of the length of `zero`.
    print(s)
    s = str(len(pos))
    for i in pos:
        s += ' ' + str(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `zero` is a list containing all zeros from `a`, `pos` is a list containing all positive integers from `a` and must have at least one element, `neg` is a list containing all negative integers from `a`, `s` is the string representation of the length of `pos` followed by spaces and the string representations of all elements in `pos`. If `pos` is empty, `s` remains the string representation of the length of `pos`.
    print(s)

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
