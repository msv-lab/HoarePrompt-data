Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, whereas the problem description requires a function that takes `n` and `arr` as inputs. The correct function definition should be `def divide_array(n, arr):`.

2. **Handling of Input**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input directly from the user, which is not appropriate in the context of a function that should take `n` and `arr` as parameters. The function should not read input directly but should work with the provided arguments.

3. **Ensuring Non-Empty Sets**: The program attempts to ensure that the `pos` set is non-empty by moving the last two elements from `neg` to `pos` if `pos` is initially empty. However, this logic can lead to issues:
   - If `neg` has fewer than two elements, the program will raise an error.
   - The program does not handle the case where `neg` has exactly one element, which would make it impossible to move two elements to `pos`.

4. **Product Conditions**: The program does not explicitly check the product conditions, but it tries to ensure that the sets meet the required conditions by manipulating the elements. However, the logic is flawed:
   - If `neg` has an even number of elements, the program moves the last element to `zero` to make the product of `neg` negative. This is correct.
   - However, if `neg` has an odd number of elements, the program does not handle the case where `pos` is empty correctly. Moving the last two elements from `neg` to `pos` might not always result in a valid solution.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the results in the correct format, but the logic leading to the output is incorrect, as explained above.

### Corrected Function
To meet the problem description, the function should be defined as follows:

```python
def divide_array(n, arr):
    zero = [i for i in arr if i == 0]
    pos = [i for i in arr if i > 0]
    neg = [i for i in arr if i < 0]

    # Ensure pos is non-empty
    if len(pos) == 0:
        if len(neg) >= 2:
            pos.append(neg.pop())
            pos.append(neg.pop())
        else:
            raise ValueError("No valid solution exists")

    # Ensure neg has an odd number of elements
    if len(neg) % 2 == 0:
        zero.append(neg.pop())

    # Print the results
    print(len(neg), *neg)
    print(len(zero), *zero)
    print(len(pos), *pos)
```

This corrected function ensures that:
- The `pos` set is non-empty.
- The `neg` set has an odd number of elements, ensuring the product is negative.
- The `zero` set contains at least one zero, ensuring the product is zero.
- The `pos` set contains at least one positive element, ensuring the product is positive.

Given these corrections, the function now meets the problem description and can be considered correct.
