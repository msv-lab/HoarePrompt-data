The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then categorizes these integers into three lists: `zero` (containing all zeros), `pos` (containing all positive integers), and `neg` (containing all negative integers). If there are no positive integers, it moves the last two negative integers to the `pos` list. If the number of negative integers is even, it moves the last negative integer to the `zero` list. Finally, it prints three lines: the first line contains the count and elements of the `neg` list, the second line contains the count and elements of the `zero` list, and the third line contains the count and elements of the `pos` list. The function ensures that the `pos` list always contains at least one element. Edge cases include scenarios where the input list has no positive integers or an even number of negative integers, which are handled as described. However, the function does not ensure that the subarrays are contiguous, as stated in the return postconditions.
