You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vitaly has an array of n distinct integers. Vitaly wants to divide this array into three non-empty sets so as the following conditions hold: 

  1. The product of all numbers in the first set is less than zero ( < 0). 
  2. The product of all numbers in the second set is greater than zero ( > 0). 
  3. The product of all numbers in the third set is equal to zero. 
  4. Each number from the initial array must occur in exactly one set. 



Help Vitaly. Divide the given array.

Input

The first line of the input contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (|ai| ≤ 103) — the array elements.

Output

In the first line print integer n1 (n1 > 0) — the number of elements in the first set. Then print n1 numbers — the elements that got to the first set.

In the next line print integer n2 (n2 > 0) — the number of elements in the second set. Then print n2 numbers — the elements that got to the second set.

In the next line print integer n3 (n3 > 0) — the number of elements in the third set. Then print n3 numbers — the elements that got to the third set.

The printed sets must meet the described conditions. It is guaranteed that the solution exists. If there are several solutions, you are allowed to print any of them.
