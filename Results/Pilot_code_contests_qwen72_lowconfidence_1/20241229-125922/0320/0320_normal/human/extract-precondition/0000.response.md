Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def divide_array(n, arr):` where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies |a_i| ≤ 103.**
