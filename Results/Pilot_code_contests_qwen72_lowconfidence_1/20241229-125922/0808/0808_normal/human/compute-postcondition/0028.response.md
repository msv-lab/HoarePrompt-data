Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, all indices of the form `8 + 3k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) are set to `False`, and if `a[3]` is `True`, all indices of the form `4m + 15` (where `m` is a non-negative integer and `4m + 15` is between 15 and 999,999 inclusive) are set to `False`. All other indices remain `True`. `i` is 4, and `j` is 999,999 if `a[3]` is `True`; otherwise, `j` is the largest index less than 1,000,000 that is congruent to 8 modulo 3.***
