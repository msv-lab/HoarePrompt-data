To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values.
  - If `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`.
  - All other indices remain `True`.
- `i` is 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`.
   - For `i = 3`, this becomes `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
   - The loop increments by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the starting value (8) is less than 1,000,000.
   - Since 8 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will start with `j = 8`.
   - The variable `i` is already set to 3, which is correct for the loop to execute.
   - The list `a` and the integer `n` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `i` is 3 and the starting value `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) is less than 1,000,000. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring `i` is 3.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all other indices remain `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**.
