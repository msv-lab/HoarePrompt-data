Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values. If `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all indices of the form `8 + 3k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) are set to `False`, while all other indices remain `True`. `i` is 3, and `j` is the largest index less than 1,000,000 that is congruent to 8 modulo 3.***
