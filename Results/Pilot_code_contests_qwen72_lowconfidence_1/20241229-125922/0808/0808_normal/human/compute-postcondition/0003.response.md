To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 999,999 \)
   - `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`
   - `i` is 2
   - The value of `a[1]` is `True`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop uses `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, which means:
     - Start: `i ** 2 - 1`
     - Stop: `1000000` (exclusive)
     - Step: `i`

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - For `i = 2`:
     - Start: \( 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
     - Stop: `1000000` (exclusive)
     - Step: `2`
   - Therefore, the loop will iterate over the values: 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., up to the largest value less than 1,000,000 that satisfies the step condition.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the start value (`3`) is less than the stop value (`1000000`), which is true.
   - The step value (`2`) ensures that the loop will continue to increment by 2 until it reaches or exceeds the stop value.

### Adjusted State:
- The initial state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute:
  - `i` is 2, which is a valid starting point for the loop.
  - The range starts at 3 and increments by 2, which will always be less than 1,000,000 until the loop completes.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial state for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`, `i` is 2, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`**
