The code snippet sets the value at index `j` in the list `a` to `False`. Given the initial state, `j` is 14, so `a[14]` is set to `False`.

- `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` remains a list of 1,000,000 boolean values.
- `a[1]` remains `True`.
- All odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` remain set to `False`.
- `a[8]` remains `False`.
- `a[11]` remains `False`.
- `i` remains 3.
- `j` remains 14.
- `a[14]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, `a[8]` is `False`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
