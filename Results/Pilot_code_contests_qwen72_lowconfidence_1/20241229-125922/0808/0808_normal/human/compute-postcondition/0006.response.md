The code `a[j] = False` sets the value at index `j` in the list `a` to `False`. Given that `j` is 5, this means `a[5]` is now `False`. Since `a[1]` was initially `True` and no operation affects `a[1]`, it remains `True`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with one value at index `5` set to `False` and the rest set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`**
