The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`. Given `j` is 8, the 9th element in the list `a` (since indexing starts at 0) is now `False`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all other indices remain `True` except `a[8]` which is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**
