To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 999,999\).
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with one value at index `j` set to `False` and the rest set to `True`.
- `i` is 2.
- The value of `a[1]` is `True`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - The loop starts with `j` in the range `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`.
   - Calculate `i ** 2 - 1`:
     \[
     i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, the loop starts with `j = 3` and increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) each time.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < 1000000`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 2).
   - So, the next value of `j` will be:
     \[
     j = 3 + 2 = 5
     \]

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute again if `j < 1000000`.
- Since `j` is 5 after the first iteration, and 5 is less than 1000000, the loop will indeed execute again.

### Final State:
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` is now 5.
- The value of `a[1]` remains `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with one value at index `j` set to `False` and the rest set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`**.
