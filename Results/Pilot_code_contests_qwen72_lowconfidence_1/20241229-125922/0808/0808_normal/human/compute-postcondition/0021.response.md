To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values.
  - If `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`.
  - All indices of the form `8 + 3k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) are set to `False`.
  - All other indices remain `True`.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is the largest index less than 1,000,000 that is congruent to 8 modulo 3.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.
   - Given `i` is 4, the starting point of the loop is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.
   - The increment step is `i`, which is 4.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is already set to 4, which is correct.
   - `j` must be the largest index less than 1,000,000 that is congruent to 8 modulo 3. This means `j` should be of the form `3k + 8` and less than 1,000,000.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The initial value of `j` should be set to the largest number less than 1,000,000 that satisfies `j % 3 == 8 % 3`.
   - To find this value, we can use the formula: `j = 1000000 - (1000000 % 3) - (3 - (8 % 3))`.

### Calculation for `j`:
- `1000000 % 3` gives the remainder when 1,000,000 is divided by 3.
- `8 % 3` is 2.
- Therefore, `j = 1000000 - (1000000 % 3) - (3 - 2) = 1000000 - 1 - 1 = 999998`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with specific conditions.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 999998.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all indices of the form `8 + 3k` are set to `False`, while all other indices remain `True`, `i` is 4, `j` is 999998**.
