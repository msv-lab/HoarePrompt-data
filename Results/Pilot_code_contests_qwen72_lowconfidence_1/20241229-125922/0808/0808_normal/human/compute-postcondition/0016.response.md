To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999.
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values.
  - `a[1]` is `True`.
  - All odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`.
  - `a[8]` is `False`.
  - `a[11]` is `False`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 11.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`.
   - The starting value of `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`.
   - The step size is `i`.
   - The loop will continue until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 11.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `11 + 3 = 14`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` needs to be updated to 14 for the next iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, `a[8]` is `False`, `a[11]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
