The code snippet `a[j] = False` sets the value at index `j` in the list `a` to `False`. Given the initial state, the index `j` is 7, so the value at `a[7]` is set to `False`. The rest of the list remains unchanged, with the exception that the value at index 5 is already `False` and the value at index 1 is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with values at indices `5` and `7` set to `False` and the rest set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`**
