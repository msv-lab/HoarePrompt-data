To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the current state and the conditions under which the loop will execute again.

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with specific conditions:
  - If `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`.
  - All indices of the form `8 + 3k` are set to `False`.
  - All other indices remain `True`.
- `a[999998]` is `False`.
- `i` is 4.
- `j` is 999998.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop starts with `j` being `i ** 2 - 1`.
   - Given `i` is 4, `i ** 2 - 1` is `15`.
   - Therefore, the loop starts with `j = 15`.

2. **Step Size**: The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) each iteration.
   - So, the next value of `j` will be `15 + 4 = 19`.

3. **End Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.
   - The current value of `j` is 999998.
   - The next value of `j` will be `999998 + 4 = 1000002`.

### State Adjustments:
- **`j`**: The next value of `j` is `999998 + 4 = 1000002`.
- **Loop Execution**: Since `1000002` is greater than `1000000`, the loop will not execute again.

### Final State:
Since the loop will not execute again, the state remains unchanged except for the value of `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all indices of the form `8 + 3k` are set to `False`, while all other indices remain `True`, `a[999998]` is `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 1000002**
