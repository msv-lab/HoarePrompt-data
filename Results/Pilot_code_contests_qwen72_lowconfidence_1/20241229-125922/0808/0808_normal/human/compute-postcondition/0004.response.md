The code snippet `a[j] = False` changes the value of the element at index `j` in the list `a` from `True` to `False`. Since the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact index that is being modified. However, we know that the list `a` initially contains 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`. The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with one value at index `j` set to `False` and the rest set to `True`, `i` is 2, and the value of `a[1]` is `True`**
