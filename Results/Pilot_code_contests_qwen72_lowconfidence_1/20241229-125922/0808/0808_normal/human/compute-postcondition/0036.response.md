Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where `a[0]` and `a[1]` are `True`, and for each index `i` from 2 to 999,999, `a[i]` is `True` if and only if `i` is a prime number. All other indices are set to `False`. `sys.stdin` must have contained at least one line of input for each iteration of the loop. The number of `True` values from index 1 to `int(s) - 1` in the list `a` has been printed for each line of input. If `sys.stdin` was empty, no output is produced and the list `a` remains unchanged.**
