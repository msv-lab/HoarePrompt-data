`a[j]` is set to `False`. Given that `j` is 1000002, the index 1000002 in the list `a` is now `False`. The rest of the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values where if `a[1]` is `True`, all odd indices from 3 to 999,999 in `a` are set to `False`, and all indices of the form `8 + 3k` are set to `False`, while all other indices remain `True`, `a[999998]` is `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 1000002, `a[1000002]` is `False`**
