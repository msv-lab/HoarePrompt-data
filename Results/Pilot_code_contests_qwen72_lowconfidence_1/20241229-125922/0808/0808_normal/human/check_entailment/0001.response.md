Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an off-by-one error in the indexing of the array `a`. The array `a` is used to mark whether each number is prime, but the indexing is incorrect. Specifically, the loop that processes the input:

```python
for s in sys.stdin:
    print(a[1:int(s)].count(True))
```

should actually be:

```python
for s in sys.stdin:
    n = int(s)
    print(a[2:n+1].count(True))
```

This is because the array `a` is indexed starting from 0, and the prime numbers are stored from index 2 onwards (since 0 and 1 are not prime). Therefore, the correct range to count the primes should be from index 2 to `n` inclusive.

Additionally, the sieve algorithm itself is slightly off. The initialization of the array `a` should start from 0, and the sieve should mark non-prime numbers starting from `i * i` instead of `i ** 2 - 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    a = [True] * 1000000
    a[0] = a[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    for i in range(2, int(1000000**0.5) + 1):
        if a[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, 1000000, i):
                a[j] = False
    for s in sys.stdin:
        n = int(s)
        print(a[:n+1].count(True))

func()
```

With these corrections, the program will correctly count the number of prime numbers for each input.
