The code appends a list containing `temp[i]` and `x[i]` to the list `pos`. Since `temp[i]` is greater than 0, this operation is valid. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `pos` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]], `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `negsum` is 0, `possum` is `temp[i] * x[i]`, `i` is 0, `temp[i]` is greater than 0**
