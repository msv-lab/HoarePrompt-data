The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `temp`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input.**
