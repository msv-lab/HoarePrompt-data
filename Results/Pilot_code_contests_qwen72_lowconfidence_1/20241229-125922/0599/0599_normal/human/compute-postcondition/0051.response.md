Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos`, `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, and `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`, and the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`.**
