Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`. If `temp[i]` < 0, `neg` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]], `pos` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `possum` is 0, `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`, and `i` is 0. If `temp[i]` ≥ 0, `pos` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]] if `temp[i]` > 0 or an empty list if `temp[i]` is 0, `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is `x[0]` if `temp[i]` is 0 or 0 if `temp[i]` > 0, `negsum` is 0, `possum` is `temp[i] * x[i]` if `temp[i]` > 0 or 0 if `temp[i]` is 0, and `i` is 0.***
