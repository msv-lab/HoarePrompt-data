The code reads input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input by spaces, and maps the resulting strings to integers. It then assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `t` is an integer read from input, T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, a is a list of n integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6, and t is a list of n integers where each element ti satisfies 1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6.**
