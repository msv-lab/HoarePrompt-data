To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: In a `for` loop, the iterator `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
- **Check `n`**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the next iteration will set `i` to 1. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `temp[0]` remains `temp[0] - t` (since this value is not affected by the loop increment).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`**
