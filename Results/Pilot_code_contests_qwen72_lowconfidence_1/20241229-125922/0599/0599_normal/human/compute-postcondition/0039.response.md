The code snippet `pos.append([temp[i], x[i]])` updates the list `pos` by appending a new list containing the elements `temp[i]` and `x[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the elements being appended are `temp[2]` and `x[2]`.

Let's summarize the impact on the variables:

- `pos` is updated to include the new list `[temp[2], x[2]]`.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `x`, `temp`, `neg`, `ans`, `possum`, `negsum`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `neg` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, `pos` is updated to `pos + [[temp[2], x[2]]]`, `ans` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` = 0, `possum` is updated to `possum + temp[2] * x[2]`, `negsum` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, and `i` is 2.**
