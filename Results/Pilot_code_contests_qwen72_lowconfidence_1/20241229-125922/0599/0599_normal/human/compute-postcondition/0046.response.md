The code snippet provided is:

```python
ans += i[1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Affected Variables:**
   - The variable `ans` is being updated.
   - The variable `i` is used in the expression `i[1]`.

2. **Check Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
   - There is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code adds the value of `i[1]` to `ans`.
   - The value of `i[1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume `i` is a tuple or list with at least two elements.

4. **Update Variables:**
   - `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`.

### Output State:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
- There is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`.
- `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, there is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`.**
