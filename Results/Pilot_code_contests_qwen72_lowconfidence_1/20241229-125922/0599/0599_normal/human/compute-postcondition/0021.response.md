The code snippet `possum += temp[i] * x[i]` updates the value of `possum` by adding the product of `temp[i]` and `x[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state, we know that `temp[i]` is greater than 0, and `x[i]` is an integer read from input. Since `possum` initially is 0, the new value of `possum` will be `temp[i] * x[i]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `t` is an integer read from input
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6
- `x` is a list of integers read from input
- `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`
- `pos` is an empty list
- `neg` is an empty list
- `ans` is 0
- `negsum` is 0
- `possum` is `temp[i] * x[i]`
- `i` is 0
- `temp[i]` is greater than 0

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `pos` is an empty list, `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `negsum` is 0, `possum` is `temp[i] * x[i]`, `i` is 0, `temp[i]` is greater than 0**
