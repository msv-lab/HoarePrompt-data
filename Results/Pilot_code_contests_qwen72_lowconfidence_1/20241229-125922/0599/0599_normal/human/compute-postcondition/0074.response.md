The given code snippet updates the value of `possum` by adding `t` to it. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` is defined as `i[0] * i[1]`.
- `i` is the third element in the list `neg`.
- `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`.
- `possum` is updated to `possum + t`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
- `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`.
- `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least three elements.
- The absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`.
- `i` is the third element in `neg`.
- `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.
- `ans` is `ans + i[1]`.
- `possum` is `possum + i[0] * i[1]` if `t + possum >= 0`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `possum` is updated to `possum + t`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least three elements, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the third element in `neg`, `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`, `ans` is `ans + i[1]`, `possum` is `possum + i[0] * i[1]`.**
