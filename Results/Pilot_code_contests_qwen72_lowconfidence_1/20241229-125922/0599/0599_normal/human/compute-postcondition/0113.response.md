Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`. After the loop, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i]` > 0, `neg` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i]` < 0, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i]` = 0, `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i]` > 0, and `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i]` < 0. Additionally, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than or equal to `possum`.***
