The value of `temp[i]` is decremented by `t`. Given that `i` is 0 in the initial state, the first element of the list `temp` is updated. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`**
