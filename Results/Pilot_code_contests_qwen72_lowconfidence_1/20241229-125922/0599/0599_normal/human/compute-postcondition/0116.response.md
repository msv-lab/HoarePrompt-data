Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`. After the loop, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, and `neg` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`. If `abs(negsum) > possum`, `neg` is sorted, and `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos` plus the sum of `x[i]` for all elements `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `neg` that were processed before the condition `t + possum < 0` was met. If the condition `t + possum < 0` was met during the loop, `ans` is also updated by adding `possum * 1.0 / i[0]` for the last element `i` that caused this condition to be true, and the loop breaks. `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0` plus the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all elements `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `neg` that were processed before the condition `t + possum < 0` was met. `negsum` remains the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`, and the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `neg` is empty), `ans` remains the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos`, and `possum` remains the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0`. If `possum > abs(negsum)`, `pos` is a sorted list, and `ans` is further incremented by the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] < 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` from `pos` pairs added until `t + negsum > 0` or the end of `pos` is reached. If `t + negsum > 0` for any pair in `pos`, then `ans` is further incremented by `abs(negsum * 1.0 / i[0])` and the loop breaks. `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0` plus the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` from `pos` pairs added until `t + negsum > 0` or the end of `pos` is reached. The absolute value of `negsum` is less than or equal to `possum`, and `possum` is greater than the absolute value of `negsum`. The value of `ans` has been printed. If `possum <= abs(negsum)`, the sum of `x` is printed.***
