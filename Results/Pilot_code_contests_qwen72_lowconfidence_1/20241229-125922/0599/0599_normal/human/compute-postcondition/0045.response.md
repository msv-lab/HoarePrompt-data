To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
- After the loop:
  - `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i]` > 0.
  - `neg` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i]` < 0.
  - `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i]` = 0.
  - `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i]` > 0.
  - `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i]` < 0.
  - The absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in pos:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the list `pos` is not empty. Therefore, `pos` must contain at least one pair `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i]` > 0.

2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `n` must be at least 1 to ensure there are elements in the lists `a`, `t`, and `x`.
   - `temp` must be computed as `temp[i] = temp[i] - t[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
   - There must be at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0` to ensure that `pos` is not empty.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `temp` must be computed as `temp[i] = temp[i] - t[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
- There must be at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, and there is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`**.
