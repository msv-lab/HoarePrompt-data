The code snippet `ans += x[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `x[i]` to it, where `i` is 2.

- `i` is 2.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `ans` is updated by adding `x[2]` to its current value.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `temp`, `neg`, `pos`, `possum`, `negsum`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `neg` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, `pos` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` ≥ 0, `ans` is `ans + x[2]`, `possum` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` > 0, `negsum` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, and `i` is 2.**
