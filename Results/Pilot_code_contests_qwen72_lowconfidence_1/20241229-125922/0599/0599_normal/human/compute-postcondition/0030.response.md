Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`.
- If `temp[i]` < 0:
  - `neg` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]]
  - `pos` is an empty list
  - `ans` is 0
  - `possum` is 0
  - `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`
  - `i` is 1
- If `temp[i]` ≥ 0:
  - `pos` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]] if `temp[i]` > 0 or an empty list if `temp[i]` is 0
  - `neg` is an empty list
  - `ans` is `x[0]` if `temp[i]` is 0 or 0 if `temp[i]` > 0
  - `negsum` is 0
  - `possum` is `temp[i] * x[i]` if `temp[i]` > 0 or 0 if `temp[i]` is 0
  - `i` is 1

Code Snippet:
```
possum += temp[i] * x[i]
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The code snippet updates the value of `possum` by adding `temp[i] * x[i]` to its current value.
2. The initial value of `possum` is 0 if `temp[i]` is 0 or `temp[i] * x[i]` if `temp[i]` > 0.
3. The value of `i` is 1, so we are considering the second element of `temp` and `x`.

Impact on Variables:
- `possum` is updated to `possum + temp[1] * x[1]`.

Output State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`.
- If `temp[0]` < 0:
  - `neg` is [[`temp[0]`, `x[0]`]]
  - `pos` is an empty list
  - `ans` is 0
  - `possum` is `temp[1] * x[1]` if `temp[1]` > 0 or 0 if `temp[1]` is 0
  - `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[0] * x[0])`
  - `i` is 1
- If `temp[0]` ≥ 0:
  - `pos` is [[`temp[0]`, `x[0]`]] if `temp[0]` > 0 or an empty list if `temp[0]` is 0
  - `neg` is an empty list
  - `ans` is `x[0]` if `temp[0]` is 0 or 0 if `temp[0]` > 0
  - `negsum` is 0
  - `possum` is `temp[1] * x[1]` if `temp[1]` > 0 or 0 if `temp[1]` is 0
  - `i` is 1
