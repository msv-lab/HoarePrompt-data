Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least one element, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos`. If `t + possum < 0`, `ans` is updated to `ans + possum * 1.0 / i[0]`, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to include `i[1]`, `possum` is increased by `i[0] * i[1]`, and `negsum` remains the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`. The absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the first element in `neg`, and `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.***
