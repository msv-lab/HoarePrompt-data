To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in xrange(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly initialized in the state. However, in Python, the `xrange` function (or `range` in Python 3) initializes `i` to 0 for the first iteration.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `x`, `temp`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, but they are part of the initial state and should be mentioned for completeness.

### Adjusted State:

- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `xrange` function.
- The other variables (`t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `x`, `temp`) remain as they are.

### Final State:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input**
