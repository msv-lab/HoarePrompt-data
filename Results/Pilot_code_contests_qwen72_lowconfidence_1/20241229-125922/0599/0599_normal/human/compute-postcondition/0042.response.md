Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `neg` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, `pos` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` ≥ 0, `ans` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` = 0, `possum` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` > 0, `negsum` is updated based on the condition of `temp[i]` < 0, and `i` is 2. If `temp[2]` < 0, `neg` is appended with `[temp[2], x[2]]` and `negsum` is updated to `negsum + temp[2] * x[2]`. If `temp[2]` > 0, `pos` is appended with `[temp[2], x[2]]` and `possum` is updated to `possum + temp[2] * x[2]`. If `temp[2]` = 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + x[2]`.***
