Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`. If `temp[0]` < 0, `neg` is [[`temp[0]`, `x[0]`]], `pos` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `possum` is 0, `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[0] * x[0])`, and `i` is 1. If `temp[0]` ≥ 0, `pos` is [[`temp[0]`, `x[0]`]] if `temp[0]` > 0 or an empty list if `temp[0]` is 0, `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is `x[0]` if `temp[0]` is 0 or 0 if `temp[0]` > 0, `negsum` is 0, `possum` is `temp[0] * x[0]` if `temp[0]` > 0 or 0 if `temp[0]` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `temp[1]` < 0, `neg` is appended with `[temp[1], x[1]]`, `pos` remains an empty list, `ans` remains 0, `possum` remains 0, `negsum` is updated to `negsum + (temp[1] * x[1])`, and `i` remains 1. If `temp[1]` ≥ 0, `pos` is appended with `[temp[1], x[1]]` if `temp[1]` > 0 or remains an empty list if `temp[1]` is 0, `neg` remains an empty list, `ans` is updated to `ans + x[1]` if `temp[1]` is 0 or remains 0 if `temp[1]` > 0, `negsum` remains 0, `possum` is updated to `possum + (temp[1] * x[1])` if `temp[1]` > 0 or remains 0 if `temp[1]` is 0, and `i` remains 1.***
