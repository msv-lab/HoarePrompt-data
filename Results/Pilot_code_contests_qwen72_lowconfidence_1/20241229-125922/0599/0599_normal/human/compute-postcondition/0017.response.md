The code snippet `negsum += temp[i] * x[i]` impacts the value of `negsum` by adding the product of `temp[i]` and `x[i]` to its current value. Given that `temp[i]` is less than 0, this operation will result in `negsum` being updated with a potentially negative value.

- `negsum` is updated to `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `x`, `temp`, `pos`, `neg`, `ans`, `possum`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The current value of `temp[i]` is less than 0, and this property is used in the calculation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`. `pos` is an empty list, `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `possum` is 0, `i` is 0, `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`, and the current value of `temp[i]` is less than 0.**
