The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`. The previous values of `n`, `temp`, and the condition that `pos` has at least one more element remain unchanged. The next element in `pos` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, and there is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by the value of the previous `i[1]`, `i` is the next element in `pos`, and `pos` has at least one more element**
