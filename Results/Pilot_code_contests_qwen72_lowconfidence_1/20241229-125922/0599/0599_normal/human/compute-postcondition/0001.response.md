The code `x = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `x`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from input,
- `t` is an integer read from input,
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6,
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6,
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.

After executing the code, the list `x` is populated with integers read from the new input. The variables `n`, `t`, `T`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input.**
