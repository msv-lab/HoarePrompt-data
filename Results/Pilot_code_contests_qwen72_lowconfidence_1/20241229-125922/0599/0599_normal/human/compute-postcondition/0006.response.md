The code snippet updates the value of `temp[i]` by subtracting `t` from it. Given the initial state:

- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `t` is an integer read from input
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6
- `x` is a list of integers read from input
- `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`

The impact of the code `temp[i] -= t` is:

- `temp[i]` is updated by subtracting `t` from its current value. Since `i` is 1, `temp[1]` is now `temp[1] - t`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp[0]` is `temp[0] - t`, `temp[1]` is `temp[1] - t`.**
