Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] < 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` from `pos` pairs added until `t + negsum > 0` or the end of `pos` is reached. If `t + negsum > 0` for any pair in `pos`, then `ans` is further incremented by `abs(negsum * 1.0 / i[0])` and the loop breaks. `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0` plus the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` from `pos` pairs added until `t + negsum > 0` or the end of `pos` is reached. The absolute value of `negsum` is less than or equal to `possum`, and `possum` is greater than the absolute value of `negsum`.**
