The code snippet provided is:
```
ans += i[1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `ans`: This variable is being updated.
   - `i`: This is the third element in the `neg` list, which is a pair `[temp[i], x[i]]`.

2. **Check the Initial State:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
   - `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`.
   - `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least three elements.
   - The absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`.
   - `i` is the third element in `neg`.
   - `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + i[1]` if `t + possum >= 0`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans + possum * 1.0 / neg[1][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - `possum` is updated to `possum + i[0] * i[1]` if `t + possum >= 0`.

3. **Impact of the Code Snippet:**
   - The code `ans += i[1]` adds the second element of the third pair in `neg` to `ans`.

4. **Update the Values:**
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + i[1]`.

5. **Maintain the Unchanged Values:**
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least three elements, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the third element in `neg`, `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`, `ans` is `ans + i[1]`, `possum` is `possum + i[0] * i[1]` if `t + possum >= 0`.**
