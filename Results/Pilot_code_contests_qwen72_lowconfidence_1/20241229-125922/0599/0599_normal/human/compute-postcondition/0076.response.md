Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos` plus the sum of `x[i]` for all elements `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `neg` that were processed before the condition `t + possum < 0` was met. If the condition `t + possum < 0` was met during the loop, `ans` is also updated by adding `possum * 1.0 / i[0]` for the last element `i` that caused this condition to be true, and the loop breaks. `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0` plus the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all elements `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `neg` that were processed before the condition `t + possum < 0` was met. `negsum` remains the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`, and the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `neg` is empty), `ans` remains the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus the sum of all `x[i]` for pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` in `pos`, and `possum` remains the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0`.**
