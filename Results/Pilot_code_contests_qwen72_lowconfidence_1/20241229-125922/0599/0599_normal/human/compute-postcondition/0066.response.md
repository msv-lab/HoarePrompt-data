The code snippet `ans += i[1]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the second element of the `i` list to it. Here, `i` is the second element in the `neg` list, and `i[1]` represents the second element of the pair stored in `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
- `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`.
- `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least two elements.
- `ans` is updated according to the logic inside the loop.
- `possum` is updated according to the logic inside the loop.
- The absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`.
- `i` is the second element in `neg`.
- `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.

After executing `ans += i[1]`:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by `i[1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least two elements, `ans` is updated to `ans + i[1]`, `possum` is updated according to the logic inside the loop, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the second element in `neg`, and `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.**
