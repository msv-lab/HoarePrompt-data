The code snippet `ans += i[1]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `i[1]`. Given the initial state, `ans` is incremented by the value of the next `i[1]` in `pos`, and `i` is the next element in `pos`.

- `n` remains at least 1.
- `temp` remains a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`.
- There is still at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`.
- `ans` is now incremented by the value of `i[1]`.
- `i` is the next element in `pos`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, there is at least one index `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`, `i` is the next element in `pos`.**
