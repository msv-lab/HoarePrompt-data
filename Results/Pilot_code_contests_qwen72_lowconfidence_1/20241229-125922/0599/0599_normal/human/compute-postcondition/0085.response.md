The code snippet `ans += i[1]` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `i[1]`, where `i` is assumed to be a list or tuple that is part of the context (e.g., from a loop or iteration over `pos` or `neg`). The specific value of `i[1]` is not provided in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `i[1]` is an integer.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `ans` is incremented by the value of `i[1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `T`, `a`, `t`, `x`, `temp`, `pos`, `neg`, `possum`, `negsum`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a list containing at least one pair `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0`, `ans` is the sum of all `x[i]` where `temp[i] = 0` plus `i[1]` plus the value of `i[1]` added, `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, and `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`. Additionally, the absolute value of `negsum` is less than or equal to `possum`, and `possum` is greater than the absolute value of `negsum`.**
