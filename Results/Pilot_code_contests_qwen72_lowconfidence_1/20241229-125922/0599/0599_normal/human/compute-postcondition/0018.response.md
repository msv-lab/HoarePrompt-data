The code snippet `neg.append([temp[i], x[i]])` appends a new element to the list `neg`. This new element is a list containing the values `temp[i]` and `x[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`.
- `pos` is an empty list.
- `neg` is an empty list.
- `ans` is 0.
- `possum` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`, and the current value of `temp[i]` is less than 0.

The code snippet `neg.append([temp[i], x[i]])` will add the list `[temp[i], x[i]]` to the list `neg`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`. `pos` is an empty list, `neg` is [[`temp[i]`, `x[i]`]], `ans` is 0, `possum` is 0, `i` is 0, `negsum` is `negsum + (temp[i] * x[i])`, and the current value of `temp[i]` is less than 0.**
