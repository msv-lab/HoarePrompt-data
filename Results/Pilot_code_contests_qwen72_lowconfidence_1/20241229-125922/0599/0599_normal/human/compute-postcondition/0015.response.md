To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is an integer read from input.
- `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6.
- `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6.
- `x` is a list of integers read from input.
- `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`.
- `pos` is an empty list.
- `neg` is an empty list.
- `ans` is 0.
- `negsum` is 0.
- `possum` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for i in xrange(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

### State After Adjustments:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer read from input, `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^6, `t` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ti` satisfies 1 ≤ `ti` ≤ 10^6, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `temp` is a list of integers read from input, and for each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `temp[i]` is `temp[i] - t`, `pos` is an empty list, `neg` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `negsum` is 0, `possum` is 0, `i` is 0**
