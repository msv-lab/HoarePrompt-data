The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to any variables within this statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, the control flow is altered, indicating that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least one element, `ans` is `ans + possum * 1.0 / i[0]`, `possum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] > 0`, `negsum` is the sum of `temp[i] * x[i]` for all `i` where `temp[i] < 0`, and the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the first element in `neg`, `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`, and the value of `t + possum` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
