The value of `possum` is incremented by `t`. Given that `t` is defined as `i[0] * i[1]`, and `i` is the second element in `neg`, the value of `possum` is updated to its previous value plus the product of the first and second elements of the second pair in `neg`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least two elements, `ans` is updated to `ans + i[1]`, `possum` is updated to `possum + i[0] * i[1]`, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the second element in `neg`, and `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`.
