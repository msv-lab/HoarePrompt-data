Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `temp` is a list of integers where each element `temp[i]` is originally `temp[i] - t[i]`, `pos` is a list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] > 0`, `neg` is a sorted list containing all pairs `[temp[i], x[i]]` where `temp[i] < 0` and must contain at least two elements, the absolute value of `negsum` is greater than `possum`, `i` is the second element in `neg`, and `t` is `i[0] * i[1]`. If `t + possum < 0`, `ans` is updated to `ans + possum * 1.0 / neg[1][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + i[1]` and `possum` is updated to `possum + i[0] * i[1]`.***
