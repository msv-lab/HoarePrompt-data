You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Consider a system of n water taps all pouring water into the same container. The i-th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from 0 to ai ml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered by i-th tap has temperature ti.

If for every <image> you set i-th tap to deliver exactly xi ml of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be <image> (if <image>, then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is 0).

You have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactly T. What is the maximum amount of water you may get per second if its temperature has to be T?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and T (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 106) — the number of water taps and the desired temperature of water, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) where ai is the maximum amount of water i-th tap can deliver per second.

The third line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106) — the temperature of water each tap delivers.

Output

Print the maximum possible amount of water with temperature exactly T you can get per second (if it is impossible to obtain water with such temperature, then the answer is considered to be 0).

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.
