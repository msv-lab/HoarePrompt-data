Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all temperatures `ti` are equal to the desired temperature `T`. In this scenario, the program should output the sum of all `ai` values because all water can be used without changing the temperature. However, the current implementation will incorrectly process this case, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10
5 5 5
10 10 10
```
In this case, the desired temperature `T` is 10, and all tap temperatures are also 10. The expected output should be the sum of all `ai` values, which is 15. However, the program will not handle this correctly and will output an incorrect value.
