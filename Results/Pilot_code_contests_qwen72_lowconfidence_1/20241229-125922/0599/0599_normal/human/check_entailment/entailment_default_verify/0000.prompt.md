You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Consider a system of n water taps all pouring water into the same container. The i-th water tap can be set to deliver any amount of water from 0 to ai ml per second (this amount may be a real number). The water delivered by i-th tap has temperature ti.

If for every <image> you set i-th tap to deliver exactly xi ml of water per second, then the resulting temperature of water will be <image> (if <image>, then to avoid division by zero we state that the resulting water temperature is 0).

You have to set all the water taps in such a way that the resulting temperature is exactly T. What is the maximum amount of water you may get per second if its temperature has to be T?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and T (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 106) — the number of water taps and the desired temperature of water, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) where ai is the maximum amount of water i-th tap can deliver per second.

The third line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106) — the temperature of water each tap delivers.

Output

Print the maximum possible amount of water with temperature exactly T you can get per second (if it is impossible to obtain water with such temperature, then the answer is considered to be 0).

Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 6.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It adjusts the temperatures of the water taps relative to the desired temperature `T` and categorizes them into three groups: those with a lower temperature (`neg`), those with a higher temperature (`pos`), and those already at the desired temperature (`ans`). 

The program then calculates the maximum amount of water that can be produced at the exact desired temperature by balancing the contributions from the `neg` and `pos` groups. It ensures that the total temperature deviation is minimized, and if necessary, it adjusts the flow from the taps to achieve the desired temperature. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the total negative deviation exceeds the positive deviation and vice versa, by appropriately distributing the water flow to achieve the desired temperature.

The logic seems sound and covers all the potential cases, including when the desired temperature is achievable and when it is not. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the code, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input values `n` and `t` followed by two lists of integers `x` and `temp` of length `n`. It then processes these inputs to compute a final result `ans` which is printed. The function categorizes the elements of `temp` into three groups based on their adjusted values (after subtracting `t`): positive, negative, and zero. The function then computes the sum of the corresponding elements in `x` for each category and adjusts the final result based on the sums of the products of the elements in `temp` and `x` for the positive and negative categories. If the absolute value of the sum of the negative products is greater than the sum of the positive products, the function adds elements from the positive category to the result until a certain condition is met. If the sum of the positive products is greater than the absolute value of the sum of the negative products, the function adds elements from the negative category to the result until a similar condition is met. If neither condition is met, the function prints the sum of all elements in `x`. The function handles edge cases such as empty lists and ensures that the final result is correctly computed and printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
