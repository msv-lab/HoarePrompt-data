Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle a specific edge case correctly. Specifically, consider the scenario where all the temperatures are the same and equal to the desired temperature `T`. In this case, the program should output the sum of all the maximum water amounts `x[i]` because the resulting temperature will already be `T` without any adjustments needed. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 10
5 5 5
10 10 10
```
The expected output should be `15.0` because all the temperatures are already `10`, and thus the maximum amount of water that can be delivered is the sum of all `x[i]`.

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `0` because it does not account for the case where all temperatures are already equal to `T`.

This is a clear violation of the problem description, and hence the program is incorrect.
