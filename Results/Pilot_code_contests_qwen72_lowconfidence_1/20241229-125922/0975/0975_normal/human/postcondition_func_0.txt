The function reads from standard input an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000) representing the number of nodes, and an integer `m` (a non-negative integer) representing the number of friendship pairs. It then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of integers `(ai, bi)` representing a friendship between nodes `ai` and `bi` (where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, and no pair appears more than once). The function constructs an undirected graph using these pairs, where each node is represented by a key in a dictionary, and the value is a list of adjacent nodes. The function then checks if every node in each connected component of the graph has the same number of neighbors. If all nodes in each connected component have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function completes, the graph is stored in the `graph` dictionary, and the variable `isGood` indicates whether the graph meets the criteria (True for 'YES', False for 'NO'). The function does not return any value.
