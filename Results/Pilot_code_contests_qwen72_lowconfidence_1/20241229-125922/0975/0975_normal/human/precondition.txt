n and m are integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n*(n-1)/2, representing the number of members and the number of friendship pairs, respectively. ai and bi are distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, indicating that members ai and bi are friends. No pair (ai, bi) appears more than once.
