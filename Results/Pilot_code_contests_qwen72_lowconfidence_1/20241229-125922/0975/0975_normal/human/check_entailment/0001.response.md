Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it checks whether the network is reasonable. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the transitivity condition required by the problem statement. The program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same degree (number of connections), but this is not sufficient to ensure that the network is reasonable.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```

Expected output: **NO**

Actual output from the program: **YES**

### Explanation:
- In this case, nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a cycle.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

The program will incorrectly conclude that the network is reasonable because all nodes have the same degree (2), but the network is not reasonable because the transitivity condition is violated. For example, nodes 1 and 3 are both connected to node 2, but nodes 1 and 3 are not directly connected to each other.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
