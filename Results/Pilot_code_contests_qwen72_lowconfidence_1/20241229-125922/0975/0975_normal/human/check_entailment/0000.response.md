Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z. Specifically, the program checks if all neighbors of a node have the same number of connections, but it does not verify the transitivity of friendship, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
YES
```

In this case, the nodes form a cycle (1-2-3-4-1), and the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks that all neighbors have the same number of connections, which they do in this case (each node has 2 connections). However, the network is not reasonable because the transitive property of friendship is violated (e.g., 1-2 and 2-3, but 1-3 is not a direct connection). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
