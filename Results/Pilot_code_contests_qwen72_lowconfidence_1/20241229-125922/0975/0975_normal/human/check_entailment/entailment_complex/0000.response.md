Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if the network is reasonable according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if all nodes in each connected component have the same number of neighbors, but it does not check the transitive property of friendships (i.e., if A-B and B-C, then A-C).

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Transitive Property Check Missing**:
   - The problem description requires that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z must also be true. This is the transitive property of the friendship relation.
   - The program does not explicitly check this transitive property. Instead, it only checks if all nodes in a connected component have the same degree (number of neighbors). This is insufficient to ensure the transitive property.

2. **Example Case Failure**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4 4
     1 2
     2 3
     3 4
     1 4
     ```
     - According to the problem description, this should output "NO" because although 1-2, 2-3, and 1-4 are friends, 1-3 is not a direct friendship, violating the transitive property.
     - However, the program will output "YES" because all nodes in this connected component have the same degree (2), even though the transitive property is not satisfied.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
     - For each node, check all pairs of its neighbors to see if they are also directly connected.
     - If any such pair is found to be not directly connected, the network is not reasonable, and the program should output "NO".

### Corrected Program:
```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    isGood = True
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        neighbors = set(graph[node])
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if not all(other in graph[neighbor] for other in neighbors if other != neighbor):
                isGood = False
                break
        if not isGood:
            break
    
    if isGood:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program checks the transitive property by ensuring that for each node, all pairs of its neighbors are also directly connected. If this condition is violated for any node, the network is not reasonable, and the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".
