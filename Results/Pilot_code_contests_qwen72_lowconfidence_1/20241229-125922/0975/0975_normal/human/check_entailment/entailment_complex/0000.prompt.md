You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bear Limak examines a social network. Its main functionality is that two members can become friends (then they can talk with each other and share funny pictures).

There are n members, numbered 1 through n. m pairs of members are friends. Of course, a member can't be a friend with themselves.

Let A-B denote that members A and B are friends. Limak thinks that a network is reasonable if and only if the following condition is satisfied: For every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z.

For example: if Alan and Bob are friends, and Bob and Ciri are friends, then Alan and Ciri should be friends as well.

Can you help Limak and check if the network is reasonable? Print "YES" or "NO" accordingly, without the quotes.

Input

The first line of the input contain two integers n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ 150 000, <image>) — the number of members and the number of pairs of members that are friends.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two distinct integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi). Members ai and bi are friends with each other. No pair of members will appear more than once in the input.

Output

If the given network is reasonable, print "YES" in a single line (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" in a single line (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

4 3
1 3
3 4
1 4


Output

YES


Input

4 4
3 1
2 3
3 4
1 2


Output

NO


Input

10 4
4 3
5 10
8 9
1 2


Output

YES


Input

3 2
1 2
2 3


Output

NO

Note

The drawings below show the situation in the first sample (on the left) and in the second sample (on the right). Each edge represents two members that are friends. The answer is "NO" in the second sample because members (2, 3) are friends and members (3, 4) are friends, while members (2, 4) are not.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs. The friendship pairs are represented as a list of m tuples (ai, bi), where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, and no pair appears more than once in the list.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`, `i` is `n - 1`.
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input.
    leftToCheck = set([(i + 1) for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False if any node in the graph has a different number of neighbors than any other node in its connected component, otherwise `isGood` remains True, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck` (or undefined if `leftToCheck` was empty), `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the last `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the last `graph[checkMe]`).
    if isGood :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck` (or undefined if `leftToCheck` was empty), `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the last `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the last `graph[checkMe]`. If `isGood` is True, then the graph meets the criteria for all nodes in each connected component having the same number of neighbors. If `isGood` is False, at least one node in the graph has a different number of neighbors compared to other nodes in its connected component.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000) representing the number of nodes, and an integer `m` (a non-negative integer) representing the number of friendship pairs. It then reads `m` lines, each containing a pair of integers `(ai, bi)` representing a friendship between nodes `ai` and `bi` (where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, and no pair appears more than once). The function constructs an undirected graph using these pairs, where each node is represented by a key in a dictionary, and the value is a list of adjacent nodes. The function then checks if every node in each connected component of the graph has the same number of neighbors. If all nodes in each connected component have the same number of neighbors, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function completes, the graph is stored in the `graph` dictionary, and the variable `isGood` indicates whether the graph meets the criteria (True for 'YES', False for 'NO'). The function does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
