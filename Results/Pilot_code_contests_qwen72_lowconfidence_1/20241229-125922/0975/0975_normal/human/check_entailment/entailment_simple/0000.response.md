Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the social network is reasonable according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Clique Check Logic**:
   - The program checks if all nodes in a connected component have the same number of neighbors. However, this is not sufficient to ensure the network is reasonable.
   - The problem requires that for every three distinct members \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\), if \(X\) is friends with \(Y\) and \(Y\) is friends with \(Z\), then \(X\) must also be friends with \(Z\). This is a transitive property of the friendship relation.
   - The program does not explicitly check this transitive property. It only checks if all nodes in a connected component have the same degree (number of neighbors), which is not enough to ensure the transitive property holds.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4 4
     1 2
     2 3
     3 4
     4 1
     ```
     In this case, the program would output "YES" because all nodes in the connected component have the same degree (2). However, the network is not reasonable because \(1\) is friends with \(2\) and \(2\) is friends with \(3\), but \(1\) is not friends with \(3\).

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, you need to check for the transitive property explicitly. One way to do this is to use a union-find data structure to group nodes into connected components and then check if the subgraph induced by each component forms a complete graph (clique).
   - Alternatively, you can use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph and check the transitive property during the traversal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly check the transitive property of the friendship relation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
