Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program checks if all nodes in each connected component have the same number of neighbors, which is not sufficient to ensure the network is reasonable according to the problem's definition.

The problem requires that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z, then X-Z must also hold. This means that if two members are friends with a common member, they must also be friends with each other. The current implementation only checks if all nodes in a connected component have the same degree (number of neighbors), which does not guarantee the transitive property required by the problem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
In this case, the graph would look like this:
```
1 - 2 - 3 - 4
```
Here, nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a chain where 1-2 and 2-3 are friends, but 1-3 are not friends. Similarly, nodes 2, 3, and 4 form a chain where 2-3 and 3-4 are friends, but 2-4 are not friends. According to the problem, this network should be marked as "NO" because it does not satisfy the transitive property. However, the provided program would incorrectly mark this network as "YES" because all nodes in the connected component have the same degree.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
