Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the requirement that for every three distinct members (X, Y, Z), if X-Y and Y-Z then also X-Z. The current implementation only checks if all nodes in each connected component have the same number of neighbors, which is insufficient to ensure the transitive property of friendships. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 4
```
According to the problem description, this network should be unreasonable because although 1-2 and 2-3 are friends, 1-3 are not directly friends, violating the transitive property. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "YES" because all nodes in the connected component have the same number of neighbors (3).

The correct approach would involve checking for the transitive property explicitly, ensuring that if A is a friend of B and B is a friend of C, then A must also be a friend of C. The current code does not perform this check, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
