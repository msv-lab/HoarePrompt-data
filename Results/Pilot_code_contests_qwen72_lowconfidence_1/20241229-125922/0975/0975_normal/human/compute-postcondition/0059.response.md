The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the innermost loop or conditional block in which it is contained. Since no specific loop or condition is mentioned in the context, we assume this is part of such a structure.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` and must have at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`, `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
