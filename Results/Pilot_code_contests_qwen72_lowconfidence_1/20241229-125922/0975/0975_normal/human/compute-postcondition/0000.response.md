The code snippet reads two integers from the standard input, splitting them by whitespace and converting them to integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `m` respectively.

- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs.
- After executing the code, `n` and `m` are updated to the values read from the input, which should conform to the constraints specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer read from input (3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `m` is a non-negative integer read from input representing the number of friendship pairs.**
