The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. Since no loops or conditions are explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, we assume the `break` is exiting an implicit loop or condition from the context. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` and must have at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. The length of the list of adjacent nodes for the node `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
