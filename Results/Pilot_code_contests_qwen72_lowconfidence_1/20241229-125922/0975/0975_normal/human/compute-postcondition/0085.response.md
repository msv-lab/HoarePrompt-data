The code `leftToCheck = set([])` initializes or reinitializes `leftToCheck` as an empty set.

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` remains a non-negative integer.
- `graph` remains a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes.
- `isGood` remains False.
- `checkMe` remains the last element removed from `leftToCheck`.
- `neighbors` remains the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`.
- `cliqueSize` remains at least 1.
- `neighbor` remains the next element in the `neighbors` list (assuming it exists and the number of adjacent nodes for this `neighbor` equals `cliqueSize`).

However, `leftToCheck` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list (assuming it exists and the number of adjacent nodes for this `neighbor` equals `cliqueSize`), `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
