The code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into components, and maps each component to an integer, updating the `edge` variable with this new sequence of integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` is greater than `n + 1`
- `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line

After executing the code, the `edge` variable is updated with the new sequence of integers from the input line. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than `n + 1`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `edge` is a sequence of integers from the input line**
