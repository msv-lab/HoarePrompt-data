The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. Since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, we assume the `break` is intended to exit such a structure that was part of the broader context not shown here. The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement itself.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes
- `isGood` is False
- `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`
- `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`
- `cliqueSize` is at least 1
- `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list (assuming it exists and the number of adjacent nodes for this `neighbor` equals `cliqueSize`)
- `leftToCheck` is an empty set
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list (assuming it exists and the number of adjacent nodes for this `neighbor` equals `cliqueSize`), `leftToCheck` is an empty set, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
