Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe`, `isGood` is True, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]` which must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. The length of the list `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize` for the current `neighbor`.***
