The code snippet `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` updates the `graph` dictionary by appending `edge[1]` to the list associated with the key `edge[0]`. This operation modifies the `graph` dictionary but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, or `edge`.

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `graph` now has the key `edge[0]` mapping to a list that includes `edge[1]`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `edge` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `graph[edge[0]]` is a list that now includes `edge[1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `edge` contains the mapped integers from the input line.**
