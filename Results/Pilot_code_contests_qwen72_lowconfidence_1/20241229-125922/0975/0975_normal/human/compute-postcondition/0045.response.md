The line of code `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` attempts to remove the set of `neighbors` from the set `leftToCheck`. Since `leftToCheck` is a set, and the method `.discard()` is used, if `set(neighbors)` is not present in `leftToCheck`, no error will occur, and `leftToCheck` will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes
- `leftToCheck` is an empty set if `isGood` is False, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe`
- `isGood` is False if any `neighbor` in `graph[checkMe]` has a different number of neighbors than `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` remains True
- `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`
- `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]`
- `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`

The impact of the code:
- `leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))` will attempt to remove the set of `neighbors` from `leftToCheck`. If `set(neighbors)` is not in `leftToCheck`, `leftToCheck` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set if `isGood` is False, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe` and excluding the set of `neighbors`, `isGood` is False if any `neighbor` in `graph[checkMe]` has a different number of neighbors than `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` remains True, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`.**
