According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `neighbors` list. For the loop to execute, the `neighbors` list must contain at least one element. Given the initial state, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` in the `graph` dictionary. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `graph[checkMe]` must have at least one adjacent node.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` and must have at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
