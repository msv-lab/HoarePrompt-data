The code snippet `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` updates the `graph` dictionary by appending `edge[0]` to the list associated with the key `edge[1]`. This means that the list at `graph[edge[1]]` now includes both the existing elements and `edge[0]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `graph` remains a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive. The list associated with the key `edge[1]` now includes `edge[0]`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `edge` contains the mapped integers from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `edge` contains the mapped integers from the input line.**
