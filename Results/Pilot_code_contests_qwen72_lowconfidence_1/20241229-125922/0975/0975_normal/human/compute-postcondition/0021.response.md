To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop and its effects on the variables. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(m):
    edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
    graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - For each iteration, the loop reads an edge from the input, which consists of two integers.
   - These integers are added to each other's adjacency lists in the `graph` dictionary.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `m` is the number of iterations the loop will run.
   - `graph` is modified by adding edges to the adjacency lists.
   - `i` is not used within the loop body and is irrelevant to the final state.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `m` iterations, `graph` will have `m` edges added.
   - Each key in `graph` (from 1 to `n`) will have a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input.
   - `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
   - `m` is the number of edges processed.
   - `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, where each key maps to a list of adjacent nodes.
   - `i` is not relevant to the final state.

### Conclusion
If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `graph` remains a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each mapping to an empty list. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `m` times, and `graph` will be populated with the adjacency lists based on the edges read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input.**
