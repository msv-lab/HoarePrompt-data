`checkMe` is updated to the last element removed from `leftToCheck`. Since `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element, `checkMe` now holds this value, and `leftToCheck` has one fewer element. The states of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `isGood`, `neighbors`, and `cliqueSize` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` has one fewer element, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
