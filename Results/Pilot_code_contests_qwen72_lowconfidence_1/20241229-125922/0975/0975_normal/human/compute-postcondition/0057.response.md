The value of `isGood` is explicitly set to `False`. Since `isGood` was already `False` according to the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` and must have at least two elements, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`, `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list**
