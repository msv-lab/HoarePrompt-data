The code snippet `graph[i + 1] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `graph`, where the key is `i + 1` and the value is an empty list `[]`. Given that `i` is 0, the key becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is {1: []}, `i` is 0.**
