The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the innermost loop or conditional structure (like `if`, `for`, `while`) in which it is contained. However, since no specific loop or conditional structure is mentioned in the provided code snippet, we assume that the `break` is intended to exit such a structure.

Given this, the `break` statement does not alter the values of the variables directly. It only affects the flow of the program by terminating the loop or conditional structure.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the flow control aspect, which is not directly represented in the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, and the length of the list of adjacent nodes for the node `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
