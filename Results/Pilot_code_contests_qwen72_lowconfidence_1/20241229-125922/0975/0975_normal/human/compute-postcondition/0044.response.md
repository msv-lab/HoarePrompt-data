Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set if `isGood` is False, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe`, `isGood` is False if any `neighbor` in `graph[checkMe]` has a different number of neighbors than `cliqueSize`, otherwise `isGood` remains True, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`.**
