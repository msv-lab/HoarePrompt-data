Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. If any node in `neighbors` has a different number of adjacent nodes compared to `cliqueSize`, then `isGood` is False and `leftToCheck` is an empty set. If all nodes in `neighbors` have the same number of adjacent nodes as `cliqueSize`, then `isGood` remains False (as it was initially), and `leftToCheck` is an empty set.**
