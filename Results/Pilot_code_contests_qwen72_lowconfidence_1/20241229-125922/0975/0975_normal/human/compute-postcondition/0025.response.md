The variable `checkMe` is assigned the value of an element removed from the set `leftToCheck`. Since `leftToCheck` initially contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `checkMe` will be one of these integers, and `leftToCheck` will now contain `n-1` elements.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe`, `isGood` is True, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`**
