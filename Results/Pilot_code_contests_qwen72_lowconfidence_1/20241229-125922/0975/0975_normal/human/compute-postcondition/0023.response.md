The code snippet assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `isGood`. This operation does not affect any other variables or the structure of the program. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `leftToCheck` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `isGood` is True**
