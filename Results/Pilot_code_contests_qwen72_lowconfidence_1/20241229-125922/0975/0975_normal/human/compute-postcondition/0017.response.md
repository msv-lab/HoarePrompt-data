According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `m` is greater than `n`, `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, and `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. For the loop condition (`i < m`) to still hold true, `m` must be greater than `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than `n + 1`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line**
