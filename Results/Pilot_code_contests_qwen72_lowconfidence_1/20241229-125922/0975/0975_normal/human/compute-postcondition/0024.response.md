According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the set `leftToCheck`. If `len(leftToCheck)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, the set `leftToCheck` is guaranteed to contain at least 3 elements, ensuring that `len(leftToCheck)` is greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `isGood` is True**
