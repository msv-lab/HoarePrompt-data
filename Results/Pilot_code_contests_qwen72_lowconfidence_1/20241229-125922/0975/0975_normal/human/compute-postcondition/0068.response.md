According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `leftToCheck`. The loop condition is `len(leftToCheck) > 0`, meaning the loop will continue as long as `leftToCheck` is not empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `leftToCheck` is described as an empty set. For the loop to execute one more time, `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state of `leftToCheck` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` must contain at least one element, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
