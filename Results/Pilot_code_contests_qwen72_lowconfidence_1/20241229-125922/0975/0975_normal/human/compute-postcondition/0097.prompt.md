You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, and m is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs. The friendship pairs are represented as a list of m tuples (ai, bi), where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, and no pair appears more than once in the list.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
    graph = {}
    for i in range(n):
        graph[i + 1] = []
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`, `i` is `n - 1`.
    for i in range(m):
        edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())
        
        graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        
        graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input.
    leftToCheck = set([(i + 1) for i in range(n)])
    isGood = True
    while len(leftToCheck) > 0:
        checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()
        
        neighbors = graph[checkMe]
        
        cliqueSize = len(neighbors)
        
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if len(graph[neighbor]) != cliqueSize:
                isGood = False
                leftToCheck = set([])
                break
        
        leftToCheck.discard(set(neighbors))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False if any node in the graph has a different number of neighbors than any other node in its connected component, otherwise `isGood` remains True, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck` (or undefined if `leftToCheck` was empty), `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the last `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the last `graph[checkMe]`).
    if isGood :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck` (or undefined if `leftToCheck` was empty), `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the last `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the last `graph[checkMe]`. If `isGood` is True, then the graph meets the criteria for all nodes in each connected component having the same number of neighbors. If `isGood` is False, at least one node in the graph has a different number of neighbors compared to other nodes in its connected component.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000; `m`, a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs; and a list of friendship pairs, each represented as a tuple (ai, bi) where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, with no pair appearing more than once. The function's output is not specified in the given context, so the exact return value cannot be determined from the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
