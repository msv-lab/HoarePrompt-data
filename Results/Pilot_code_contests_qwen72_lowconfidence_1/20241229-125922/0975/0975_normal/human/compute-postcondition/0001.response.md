The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `graph`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs.
- After executing the code, `graph` is initialized to an empty dictionary `{}`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer read from input (3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000), `m` is a non-negative integer read from input representing the number of friendship pairs, `graph` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**
