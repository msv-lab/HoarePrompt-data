The code assigns the length of the list `neighbors` to the variable `cliqueSize`. Given that `neighbors` is defined as the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` in the `graph` dictionary, `cliqueSize` will now hold the number of elements in this list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
