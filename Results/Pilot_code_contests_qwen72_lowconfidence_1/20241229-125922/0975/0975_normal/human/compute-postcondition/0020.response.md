The code `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` appends `edge[0]` to the list associated with the key `edge[1]` in the dictionary `graph`. This operation modifies the `graph` dictionary but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, or `edge`.

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` remains greater than `n + 1`.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `edge` remains a sequence of integers from the input line.
- `graph` now has `edge[0]` appended to the list of `graph[edge[1]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than `n + 1`, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[0]]` includes `edge[1]`, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `edge` is a sequence of integers from the input line.**
