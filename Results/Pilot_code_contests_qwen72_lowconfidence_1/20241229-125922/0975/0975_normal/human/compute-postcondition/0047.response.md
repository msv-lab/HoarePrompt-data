The code snippet `checkMe = leftToCheck.pop()` assigns the value of one element from the set `leftToCheck` to the variable `checkMe`. Since `leftToCheck` is a set, the specific element removed is not predictable (sets do not maintain order). However, based on the initial state, `leftToCheck` is either empty (if `isGood` is False) or contains integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe` and excluding the set of `neighbors`.

Since `isGood` is False, `leftToCheck` is empty, and attempting to pop an element from an empty set will raise a `KeyError`. Therefore, the code will not execute successfully, and no changes will be made to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**. 

However, since the code raises an error, the program execution would terminate at this point.
