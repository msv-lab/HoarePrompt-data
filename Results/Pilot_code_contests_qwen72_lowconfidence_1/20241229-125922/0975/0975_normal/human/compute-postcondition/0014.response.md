The code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into parts, and maps each part to an integer, updating the `edge` variable.

- `edge` was previously a tuple containing mapped integers from an input line.
- After executing the code, `edge` is updated to contain the new mapped integers from the current input line.

The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n`, `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line, and `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time.**
