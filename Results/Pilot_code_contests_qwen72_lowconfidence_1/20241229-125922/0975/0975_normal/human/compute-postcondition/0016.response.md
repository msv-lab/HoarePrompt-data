The code snippet `graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])` updates the `graph` dictionary by appending `edge[0]` to the list associated with the key `edge[1]`. This operation modifies the `graph` but does not change any other variables or conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[1]]` now includes `edge[0]`, `i` is `n`, `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line, and `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time.**
