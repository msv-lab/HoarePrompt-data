The code snippet assigns the value of `graph[checkMe]` to the variable `neighbors`. Since `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, and `graph` is a dictionary where each key from 1 to `n` maps to a list of adjacent nodes, `neighbors` will be the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes
- `leftToCheck` is an empty set
- `isGood` is False
- `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`
- `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`
- `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
