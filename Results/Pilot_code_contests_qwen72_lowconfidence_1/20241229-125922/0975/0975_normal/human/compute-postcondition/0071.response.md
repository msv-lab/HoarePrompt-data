The code snippet updates the `cliqueSize` variable to the length of the `neighbors` list. The length of `neighbors` is already defined as the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. Therefore, `cliqueSize` is now equal to the length of `neighbors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` has one fewer element, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]` (or equivalently, the length of `neighbors`).**
