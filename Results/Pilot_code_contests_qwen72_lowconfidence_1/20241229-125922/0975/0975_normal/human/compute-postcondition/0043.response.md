Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]` which must contain at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`, the next `neighbor` in `neighbors` is the next element in the list of `graph[checkMe]`. If the length of `graph[neighbor]` is not equal to `cliqueSize`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next step.***
