Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False (indicating that there exists at least one node in the graph that has a different number of neighbors than any other node in its connected component), `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck` (or undefined if `leftToCheck` was empty), `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the last `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in the last `graph[checkMe]`).**
