The code `graph[i + 1] = []` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `graph`, where the key is `i + 1` and the value is an empty list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, `graph[2]` is set to an empty list.

The updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` remains a non-negative integer
- `graph` now contains two keys: 1 and 2, both mapping to empty lists
- `i` remains 1

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is {1: [], 2: []}, `i` is 1**
