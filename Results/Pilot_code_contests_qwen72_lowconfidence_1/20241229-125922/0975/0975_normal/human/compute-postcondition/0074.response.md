The code snippet assigns `False` to the variable `isGood`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` has one fewer element, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, and the length of the list of adjacent nodes for the node `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**
