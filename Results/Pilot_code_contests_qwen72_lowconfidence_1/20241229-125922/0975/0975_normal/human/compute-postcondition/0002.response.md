To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
   - `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs.
   - `graph` is an empty dictionary `{}`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Variable `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, as it will be the starting value of the loop variable.
- **Variable `n`**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, this condition is already satisfied (3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000).

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs.
- `graph` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
- `i` is 0.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `n` is within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000). The only additional state needed is the initialization of `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs, `graph` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `i` is 0.**
