`cliqueSize` is assigned the value of the length of the list `neighbors`, which is `graph[checkMe]`. The value of `cliqueSize` is therefore the number of neighbors of the node `checkMe` in the graph. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` exclusive of the value assigned to `checkMe`, `isGood` is True, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is `graph[checkMe]`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`**
