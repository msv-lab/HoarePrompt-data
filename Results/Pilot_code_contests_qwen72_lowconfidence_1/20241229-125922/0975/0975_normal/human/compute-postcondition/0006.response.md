According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is {1: [], 2: []}, `i` is 2**
