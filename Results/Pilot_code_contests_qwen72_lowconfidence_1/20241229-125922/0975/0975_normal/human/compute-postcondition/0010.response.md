The line of code `edge = map(int, stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, splits the line into components based on spaces, and maps these components to integers, storing them in `edge`.

- `n` remains an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `graph` remains a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `edge` now contains the mapped integers from the input line.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `edge` contains the mapped integers from the input line.**
