The code reassigns `leftToCheck` to an empty set, which does not change its state since it was already an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe` and must have at least one element, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. The length of the list of adjacent nodes for the node `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**
