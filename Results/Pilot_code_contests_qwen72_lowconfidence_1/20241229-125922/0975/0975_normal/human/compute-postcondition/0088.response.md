Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is either an empty set or has one fewer element than its original size, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is the number of elements in `graph[checkMe]`. If any `neighbor` in `neighbors` has a different number of adjacent nodes than `cliqueSize`, `leftToCheck` is an empty set. Otherwise, `leftToCheck` retains its original size minus one.**
