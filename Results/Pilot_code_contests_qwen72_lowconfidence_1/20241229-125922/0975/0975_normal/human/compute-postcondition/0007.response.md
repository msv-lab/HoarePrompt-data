The code `graph[i + 1] = []` updates the dictionary `graph` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` and the value is an empty list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `graph` is {1: [], 2: []}
- `i` is 2

After executing the code:
- `graph` is updated to include a new key-value pair with the key `i + 1` (which is 3) and the value `[]`.
- The new state of `graph` is {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is {1: [], 2: [], 3: []}, `i` is 2**
