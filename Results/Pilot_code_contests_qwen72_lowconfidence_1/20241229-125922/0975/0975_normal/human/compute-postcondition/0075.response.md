The code snippet reassigns `leftToCheck` to an empty set. This affects the value of `leftToCheck` but does not change the values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` is an empty set, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, and the length of the list of adjacent nodes for the node `neighbor` is not equal to `cliqueSize`.**
