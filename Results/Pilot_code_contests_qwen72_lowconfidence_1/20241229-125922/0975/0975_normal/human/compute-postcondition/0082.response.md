Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes, `leftToCheck` has one fewer element, `isGood` is False, `checkMe` is the last element removed from `leftToCheck`, `neighbors` is the list of adjacent nodes corresponding to the key `checkMe`, `cliqueSize` is at least 1, `neighbor` is the next element in the `neighbors` list. If the number of adjacent nodes for `neighbor` does not equal `cliqueSize`, `leftToCheck` becomes an empty set and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
