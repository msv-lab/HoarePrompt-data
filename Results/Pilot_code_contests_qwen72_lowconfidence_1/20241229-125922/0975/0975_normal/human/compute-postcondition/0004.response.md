According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is {1: []}, `i` is 1**
