The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters: `n` and `m`, along with a list of friendship pairs. Here, `n` is an integer within the range of 3 to 150,000, inclusive, and `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs. Each friendship pair is a tuple `(ai, bi)` where `1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n` and `ai ≠ bi`, and no pair appears more than once in the list.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters:
```python
def func():
```

Given this discrepancy, I will assume the correct function signature should include the parameters `n`, `m`, and the list of friendship pairs. Assuming this corrected function signature, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000; `m`, a non-negative integer representing the number of friendship pairs; and a list of friendship pairs, each represented as a tuple (ai, bi) where 1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n and ai ≠ bi, with no pair appearing more than once. The function's output is not specified in the given context, so the exact return value cannot be determined from the provided information.**
