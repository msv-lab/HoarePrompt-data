To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step:

1. **State before the loop starts:**
   - `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000.
   - `m` is a non-negative integer.
   - `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **For loop statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(m):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(m)` produces a sequence of numbers. This means `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` inside the loop will be iterated over the range from 0 to `m-1`. The initial value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) is irrelevant to the loop's execution because the loop reassigns `i` to values from `range(m)`.

4. **Adjustments needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` must be greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to an empty list `[]`, `i` is `n - 1`**
