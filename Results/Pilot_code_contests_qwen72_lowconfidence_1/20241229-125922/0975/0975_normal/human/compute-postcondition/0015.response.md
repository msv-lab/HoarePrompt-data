The code snippet `graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])` adds `edge[1]` to the list associated with the key `edge[0]` in the dictionary `graph`.

- The value of `graph[edge[0]]` is updated to include `edge[1]`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `edge`) are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is greater than 0, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, `graph[edge[0]]` now includes `edge[1]`, `i` is `n`, `edge` contains the new mapped integers from the input line, and `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time.
