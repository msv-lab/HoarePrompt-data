The code initializes a set `leftToCheck` with elements ranging from 1 to `n` inclusive. This means that `leftToCheck` will contain all integers from 1 up to and including `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 150,000, `m` is a non-negative integer, `graph` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `n` inclusive, each key mapping to a list of adjacent nodes based on the edges read from the input, `leftToCheck` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.**
