The function reads an integer `N` and two lists of integers `A` and `B` from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the first `i` elements of `A` and the last `N-i+1` elements of `B` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The function prints the maximum sum found and the intermediate sums for each `i`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `N` being an integer between 1 and 100, `A` and `B` being lists of integers, and `maxim` holding the maximum sum calculated. Edge cases include handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect list lengths), which are not addressed in the current implementation.
