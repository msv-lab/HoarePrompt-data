Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle the case where `N = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, when `N = 1`, the grid is a 2x1 grid, and you start at (1, 1) and end at (2, 1). The expected output should be the sum of the candies in both cells (i.e., `A[1, 1] + A[2, 1]`).

However, the current implementation incorrectly splits the input into two separate lists and attempts to sum elements from these lists, which does not work as intended for `N = 1`. Specifically, the line `for i in xrange(1, N + 1):` will iterate over the range `[1, 2]` for `N = 1`, which is incorrect because it will attempt to access elements beyond the valid index range for the lists `A` and `B`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
3
```
The expected output is `5` (since `2 + 3 = 5`), but the program will produce an incorrect result because it will not handle the single-column grid correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should handle the special case where `N = 1` separately, ensuring that it directly returns the sum of the candies in the two cells.
