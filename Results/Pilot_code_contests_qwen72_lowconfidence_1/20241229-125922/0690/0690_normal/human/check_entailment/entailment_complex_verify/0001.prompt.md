You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a 2 \times N grid. We will denote the square at the i-th row and j-th column (1 \leq i \leq 2, 1 \leq j \leq N) as (i, j).

You are initially in the top-left square, (1, 1). You will travel to the bottom-right square, (2, N), by repeatedly moving right or down.

The square (i, j) contains A_{i, j} candies. You will collect all the candies you visit during the travel. The top-left and bottom-right squares also contain candies, and you will also collect them.

At most how many candies can you collect when you choose the best way to travel?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq A_{i, j} \leq 100 (1 \leq i \leq 2, 1 \leq j \leq N)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N}
A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N}


Output

Print the maximum number of candies that can be collected.

    A = raw_input().split(' ')
    B = raw_input().split(' ')
    A = map(int, A)
    B = map(int, B)
    maxim = 0
    for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
        temp = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i - 1:N])
        print(sum(A[0:i]), sum(B[i - 1:N]))
        if maxim < temp:
            maxim = temp
    print(maxim)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input values, processes the grid to calculate the maximum number of candies that can be collected, and prints the result. The algorithm used in the program iterates over all possible points where the path can switch from the first row to the second row, calculates the total candies collected for each possible path, and keeps track of the maximum value found.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `N`, the size of the grid, and two lists `A` and `B` representing the number of candies in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Path Calculation**: The program iterates over all possible positions (from 1 to N) where the path can switch from the first row to the second row. For each position `i`, it calculates the total number of candies collected by summing the candies from the start to position `i` in the first row (`sum(A[0:i])`) and from position `i-1` to the end in the second row (`sum(B[i-1:N])`).

3. **Maximization**: The program keeps track of the maximum number of candies collected (`maxim`) and updates it whenever a new maximum is found.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the maximum number of candies that can be collected.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the smallest and largest possible values of `N` and the range of candy counts. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and A is a 2D list of integers where 1 ≤ A_{i, j} ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ N.
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = raw_input().split(' ')
    B = raw_input().split(' ')
    A = map(int, A)
    B = map(int, B)
    maxim = 0
    for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
        temp = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i - 1:N])
        
        print(sum(A[0:i]), sum(B[i - 1:N]))
        
        if maxim < temp:
            maxim = temp
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is `N + 1`, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is the maximum value of `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i-1:N])` for all `i` from 1 to `N`.
    print(maxim)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and two lists of integers `A` and `B` from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the first `i` elements of `A` and the last `N-i+1` elements of `B` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The function prints the maximum sum found and the intermediate sums for each `i`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `N` being an integer between 1 and 100, `A` and `B` being lists of integers, and `maxim` holding the maximum sum calculated. Edge cases include handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect list lengths), which are not addressed in the current implementation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
