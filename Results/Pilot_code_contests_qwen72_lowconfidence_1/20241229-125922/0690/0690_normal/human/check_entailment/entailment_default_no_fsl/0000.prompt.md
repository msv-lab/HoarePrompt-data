You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We have a 2 \times N grid. We will denote the square at the i-th row and j-th column (1 \leq i \leq 2, 1 \leq j \leq N) as (i, j).

You are initially in the top-left square, (1, 1). You will travel to the bottom-right square, (2, N), by repeatedly moving right or down.

The square (i, j) contains A_{i, j} candies. You will collect all the candies you visit during the travel. The top-left and bottom-right squares also contain candies, and you will also collect them.

At most how many candies can you collect when you choose the best way to travel?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 100
* 1 \leq A_{i, j} \leq 100 (1 \leq i \leq 2, 1 \leq j \leq N)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N}
A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N}


Output

Print the maximum number of candies that can be collected.

Program:
```
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = raw_input().split(' ')
    B = raw_input().split(' ')
    A = map(int, A)
    B = map(int, B)
    maxim = 0
    for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
        temp = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i - 1:N])
        print(sum(A[0:i]), sum(B[i - 1:N]))
        if maxim < temp:
            maxim = temp
    print(maxim)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `N` and two lists of integers `A` and `B` from the standard input. It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the first `i` elements of `A` and the last `N-i+1` elements of `B` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The function prints the maximum sum found and the intermediate sums for each `i`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `N` being an integer between 1 and 100, `A` and `B` being lists of integers, and `maxim` holding the maximum sum calculated. Edge cases include handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect list lengths), which are not addressed in the current implementation.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
