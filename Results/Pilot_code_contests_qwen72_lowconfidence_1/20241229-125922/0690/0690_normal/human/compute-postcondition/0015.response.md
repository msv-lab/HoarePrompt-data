The value of `maxim` is updated to be equal to the value of `temp`. The value of `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`. The states of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `A`, `B`) are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`, `maxim` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`**
