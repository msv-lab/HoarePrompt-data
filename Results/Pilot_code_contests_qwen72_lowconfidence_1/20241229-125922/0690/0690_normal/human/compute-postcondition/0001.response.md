The code `A = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This operation changes the value of `A` from a 2D list of integers to a list of strings.

- The initial value of `N` remains unchanged.
- The initial description of `A` being a 2D list of integers no longer holds; instead, `A` is now a list of strings derived from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **N is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, A is a list of strings derived from the input.**
