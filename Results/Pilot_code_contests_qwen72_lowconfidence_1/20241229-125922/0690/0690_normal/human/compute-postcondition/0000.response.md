The value of `N` is updated to the integer value obtained from the user input. The condition 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 still holds true as specified in the initial state. The 2D list `A` remains unchanged and continues to satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ A_{i, j} ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ N.

Output State: **N is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and A is a 2D list of integers where 1 ≤ A_{i, j} ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ N.**
