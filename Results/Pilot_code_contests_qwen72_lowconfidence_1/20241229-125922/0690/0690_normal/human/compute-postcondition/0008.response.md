The code snippet prints the sum of elements from the map object `A` from index 0 to `i-1` (which is 0 in this case, since `i` is 1), and the sum of elements from the map object `B` from index `i-1` to `N-1` (which is from index 0 to `N-1` since `i` is 1). This does not change any of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the print statement has been executed and its output would be displayed. However, since the question focuses on the state of variables and not the output itself, we only need to consider the variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is 0, `temp` is `A[0] + sum(B)`**
