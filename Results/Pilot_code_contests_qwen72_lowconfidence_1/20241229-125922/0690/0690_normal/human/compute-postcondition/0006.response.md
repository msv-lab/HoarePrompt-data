To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- **N** is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 100\).
- **A** is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- **B** is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.
- **maxim** is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **N**: The loop will execute if \(N\) is at least 1. Since \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), this condition is already satisfied.
2. **i**: The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches \(N\). Therefore, `i` should be initialized to 1.
3. **A and B**: These are map objects, and their content is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition. However, they should be present and valid for the loop to potentially use them.
4. **maxim**: This variable is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, but it should be initialized to 0 as given.

### Adjusted State:
- **N** must be an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- **i** must be initialized to 1.
- **A** and **B** should be valid map objects containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- **maxim** should be 0.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is 0**
