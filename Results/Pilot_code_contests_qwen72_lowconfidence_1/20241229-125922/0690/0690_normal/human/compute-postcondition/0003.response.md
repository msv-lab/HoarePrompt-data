The code snippet `A = map(int, A)` converts each element in the list `A` from strings to integers. This does not affect the values of `N` or `B`. The updated state reflects that `A` is now a map object containing integers.

Output State: **N is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, A is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, B is a list of strings derived from the input.**
