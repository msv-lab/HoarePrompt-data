The code `B = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `B`. The initial state specifies that `N` is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `A` is a list of strings derived from the input.

Since `raw_input()` (or `input()` in Python 3) is used to read a line of input, and the input is split into a list of strings, the new state will include the updated value of `B`.

Output State: **N is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, A is a list of strings derived from the input, B is a list of strings derived from the input.**
