The code snippet `B = map(int, B)` applies the `int` function to each element in the list `B`, converting all its elements from strings to integers. This changes the type of elements in `B` but does not alter the content of `B` in terms of the numerical values represented.

- `N` remains an input integer within the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `A` remains a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` is now a map object where each element is the integer representation of the corresponding element in the original list of strings.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an input integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, A is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, B is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.**
