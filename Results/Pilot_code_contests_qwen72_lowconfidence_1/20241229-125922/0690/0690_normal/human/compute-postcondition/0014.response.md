The code snippet `print(sum(A[0:i]), sum(B[i - 1:N]))` does not modify any variables; it only prints the results of the sums.

- `sum(A[0:i])` calculates the sum of elements in the slice of `A` from index 0 to `i` (exclusive). Given `i` is 2, this is `sum(A[0:2])`.
- `sum(B[i - 1:N])` calculates the sum of elements in the slice of `B` from index `i - 1` to `N` (exclusive). Given `i` is 2, this is `sum(B[1:N])`.

Since `i` is 2, the sums calculated are `sum(A[0:2])` and `sum(B[1:N])`. These values are printed, but no variables are updated.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`, `maxim` retains its initial value.**
