The code snippet provided only prints the value of `maxim`. This operation does not alter the state of any variables in the program. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is `N + 1`, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is the maximum value of `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i-1:N])` for all `i` from 1 to `N`.**
