Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings. If `maxim` < `temp`, then `maxim` is updated to `A[0] + sum(B)`, and `temp` remains `A[0] + sum(B)`. Otherwise, `maxim` and `temp` retain their initial values.***
