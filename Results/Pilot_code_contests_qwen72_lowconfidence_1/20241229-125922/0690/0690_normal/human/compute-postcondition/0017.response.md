To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the state at the start of the next iteration based on the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- `N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`.
- If `maxim` < `temp`, then `maxim` is updated to `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`. Otherwise, `maxim` retains its initial value.

For loop statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `N` inclusive.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
3. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
4. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `N`.

Since `N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3 and `N` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State at the start of the next iteration:
- `N` remains an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `i` is 3.
- `A` and `B` remain as they are, as they are not modified within the loop body.
- `temp` and `maxim` may change depending on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`, `maxim` is either its initial value or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated.**
