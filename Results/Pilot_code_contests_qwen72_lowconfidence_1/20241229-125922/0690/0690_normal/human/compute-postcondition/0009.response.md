Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is 0, `temp` is `A[0] + sum(B)`. The current value of `maxim` is less than the current value of `temp`.***
