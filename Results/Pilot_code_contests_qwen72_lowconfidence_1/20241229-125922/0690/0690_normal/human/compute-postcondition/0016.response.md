Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`. If `maxim` < `temp`, then `maxim` is updated to `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`. Otherwise, `maxim` retains its initial value.***
