The code snippet calculates the value of `temp` using the sums of slices of the map objects `A` and `B`. Specifically, it sums the elements of `A` from index 0 to `i-1` and the elements of `B` from index `i-1` to `N-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- `i` is 1
- `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings
- `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings
- `maxim` is 0

The calculation for `temp` is:
- `sum(A[0:i])` will sum the elements of `A` from index 0 to `i-1` (which is 0 in this case, since `i` is 1). This means it will sum only the first element of `A`.
- `sum(B[i-1:N])` will sum the elements of `B` from index 0 to `N-1` (since `i-1` is 0).

Therefore, `temp` will be the sum of the first element of `A` plus the sum of all elements of `B`.

The updated state includes:
- `N` remains an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- `i` remains 1
- `A` remains a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings
- `B` remains a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings
- `maxim` remains 0
- `temp` is now equal to `A[0] + sum(B)`

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is 0, `temp` is `A[0] + sum(B)`**
