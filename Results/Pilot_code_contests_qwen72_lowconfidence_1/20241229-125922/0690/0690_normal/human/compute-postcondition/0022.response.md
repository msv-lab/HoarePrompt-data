To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop over all iterations, considering the initial state and the changes made during each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `maxim` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = N` (inclusive). For each iteration:
- `temp` is calculated as the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` plus the sum of the last `N - i + 1` elements of `B`.
- If `maxim` is less than `temp`, `maxim` is updated to `temp`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `N + 1` (since the loop runs from 1 to N).
- `A` and `B` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `maxim` will be the maximum value of `temp` calculated over all iterations of the loop.

### Detailed Explanation:
- The loop will execute `N` times, so `i` will take on values from 1 to `N`.
- For each `i`, `temp` is calculated as `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i-1:N])`.
- The value of `maxim` will be updated whenever `temp` is greater than the current value of `maxim`.
- After the loop, `maxim` will hold the maximum value of `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i-1:N])` for all `i` from 1 to `N`.

### Output State:
**`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is `N + 1`, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `maxim` is the maximum value of `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i-1:N])` for all `i` from 1 to `N`.**
