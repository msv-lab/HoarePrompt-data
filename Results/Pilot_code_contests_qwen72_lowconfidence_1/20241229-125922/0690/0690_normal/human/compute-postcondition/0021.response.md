Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`, and `maxim` is the maximum value between its initial value (or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated) and `temp`.***
