The code assigns the value of `temp` to `maxim`. Let's break down the changes:

- `N` remains an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `i` remains 3.
- `A` remains a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` remains a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `temp` remains `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`.
- `maxim` is now updated to the value of `temp`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`, `maxim` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`.**
