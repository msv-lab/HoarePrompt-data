The provided code snippet prints the sums of slices of the map objects `A` and `B`. Specifically, it prints `sum(A[0:i])` and `sum(B[i - 1:N])`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

- `i` is 3.
- `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`.
- `maxim` is either its initial value or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated.

The code snippet does not modify any variables, only prints the results of the sums. Therefore, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`, `maxim` is either its initial value or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated.**
