The code snippet updates the value of `temp` to `sum(A[0:i]) + sum(B[i - 1:N])`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100.
- `i` is 3.
- `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings.
- `temp` was previously `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`.
- `maxim` is either its initial value or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated.

The new value of `temp` is calculated as follows:
- `sum(A[0:i])` is equivalent to `sum(A[0:3])` because `i` is 3.
- `sum(B[i - 1:N])` is equivalent to `sum(B[2:N])` because `i - 1` is 2.

Thus, the new value of `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`.

The output state reflects this change in `temp` while keeping all other variables unchanged:

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:3]) + sum(B[2:N])`, `maxim` is either its initial value or `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])` if it was updated.**
