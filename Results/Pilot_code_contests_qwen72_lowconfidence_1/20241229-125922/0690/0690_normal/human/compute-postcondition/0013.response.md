The code snippet updates the value of `temp` to the sum of the first `i` elements of `A` plus the sum of elements in `B` starting from index `i-1` to `N-1`.

- `N` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `A` and `B` are map objects containing integers derived from the original lists of strings, and these remain unchanged.
- `temp` is now updated to `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`.
- `maxim` is only updated if `maxim < temp`, which is not covered by this snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `A` is a map object containing integers derived from the original list of strings, `B` is a map object of integers derived from the original list of strings, `temp` is `sum(A[0:2]) + sum(B[1:N])`, `maxim` retains its initial value.**
