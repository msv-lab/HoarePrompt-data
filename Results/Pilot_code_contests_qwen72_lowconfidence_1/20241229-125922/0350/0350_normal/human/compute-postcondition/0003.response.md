The line of code `A = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each part into an integer, and maps these integers to the variable `A`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `a`, or the recursion limit. However, it does define `A` as a map object that contains the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input.**
