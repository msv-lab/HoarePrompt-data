The code snippet assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `q[2]` is assigned the value of `q[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 2, `p[2]` is `p[1] + 1`, `q[2]` is `q[1]`.**
