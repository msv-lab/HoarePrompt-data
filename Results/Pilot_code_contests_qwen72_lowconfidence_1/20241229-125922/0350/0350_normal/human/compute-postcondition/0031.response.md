The code snippet updates the value of `q[i]` by setting it to `p[i - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 3.
- `p[3]` is equal to `q[2]`.
- `q[i]` is updated to `p[i - 1] + 1`, which translates to `q[3] = p[3 - 1] + 1` or `q[3] = p[2] + 1`.

Since `p[3]` is equal to `q[2]`, and we are updating `q[3]` to `p[2] + 1`, the new value of `q[3]` is `p[2] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\).
- `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input.
- `idx` is 0.
- `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 3.
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements.
- `i` is 3.
- `p[3]` is equal to `q[2]`.
- `q[3]` is `p[2] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 3, `p[3]` is equal to `q[2]`, `q[3]` is `p[2] + 1`.**
