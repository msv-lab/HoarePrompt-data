The code snippet `q[i] = q[i - 1]` assigns the value of `q[i - 1]` to `q[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\)
- `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`
- `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input
- `idx` is 0
- `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 3
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`
- `p` is a list of `size` elements
- `q` is a list of `size` elements
- `i` is 3
- `p[3]` is `p[2] + 1`

The value of `i` is 3, so `q[3]` is assigned the value of `q[2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 3, `p[3]` is `p[2] + 1`, `q[3]` is `q[2]`**
