`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which reads a line from standard input, strips off the trailing newline, and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` now represents the integer input provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6**
