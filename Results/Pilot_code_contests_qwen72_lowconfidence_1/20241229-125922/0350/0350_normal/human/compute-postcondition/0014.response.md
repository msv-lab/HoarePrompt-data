Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, `q` is a list of `size` zeros, `i` is 1, and the current value of `A[i]` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `A[0] > 0`, then `p[0] = 1` and `q[0] = 0`; otherwise, if `A[0] <= 0`, then `p[0] = 0` and `q[0] = 1`.***
