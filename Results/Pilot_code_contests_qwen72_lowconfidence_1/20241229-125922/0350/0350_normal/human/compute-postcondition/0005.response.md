The code snippet calculates the value of `total` using the formula `size * (1 + size) / 2`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `size` natural numbers. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0.
- `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.
- Recursion limit is set to 10^6.
- `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input.
- `idx` is 0.
- `size` is the length of the map object `A`.

The calculation of `total` is:
- `total = size * (1 + size) / 2`

Since `size` is the length of the map object `A`, the value of `total` will be the sum of the first `size` natural numbers.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.**
