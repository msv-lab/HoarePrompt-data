The code snippet `p[i] = q[i - 1]` updates the value of `p[i]` to be the same as `q[i - 1]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2.
- `q[1]` is 0 or 1.

Let's determine the new value of `p[2]`:

- Since `i` is 2, `p[2]` will be assigned the value of `q[1]`.
- `q[1]` is either 0 or 1.

Thus, the value of `p[2]` will be 0 or 1, depending on the value of `q[1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The updated state is:

- `n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\).
- `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input.
- `idx` is 0.
- `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1.
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `p[2]` is 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `q[1]`).

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 2, `p[2]` is 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `q[1]`).**
