Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers from standard input, where each integer in `A` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0. It then processes the list `A` to compute two values: the sum of the number of negative-to-positive transitions and the sum of the number of positive-to-negative transitions in the list. These two values are printed as a pair of integers. The function does not return any value but instead prints the result directly. Edge cases include handling lists of length 1, where no transitions can occur, and ensuring that the initial state of `p[0]` and `q[0]` is correctly set based on the sign of the first element in `A`. **
