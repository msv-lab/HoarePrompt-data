The line `input = sys.stdin.readline` assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of `input` from its default function (which reads input from the user) to reading a single line from standard input.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0

After executing the given code, the only change is in the definition of the `input` variable. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`**
