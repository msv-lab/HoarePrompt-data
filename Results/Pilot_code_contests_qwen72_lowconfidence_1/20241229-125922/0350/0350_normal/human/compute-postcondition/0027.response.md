To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\).
- `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input.
- `idx` is 0.
- `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1.
- `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`.
- `p` is a list of `size` elements.
- `q` is a list of `size` elements.
- `i` is 2.
- If `A[2] > 0`, then `p[2]` is set to `p[1] + 1` and `q[2]` is set to `q[1]`.
- If `A[2] <= 0`, then `p[2]` is set to 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `q[1]`), and `q[2]` is set to `p[1] + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, size):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `size` is greater than 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**: The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will continue if `i < size`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be greater than 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 3.
- `size` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `input`, `A`, `idx`, `total`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 3, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 3**.
