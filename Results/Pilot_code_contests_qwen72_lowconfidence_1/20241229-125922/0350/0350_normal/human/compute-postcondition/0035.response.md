The function `func` accepts no parameters explicitly within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function expects two inputs: an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. The integer `n` represents the size of the list `a`, and each element `a_i` in the list `a` is an integer satisfying -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0. The function's output is not specified in the given information, but typically, functions like this would process the list `a` in some way and return a result based on the elements of the list.

Since the output is not provided, I will describe the expected parameters:

- **Parameters**: 
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0.

- **Return Value**: Not specified in the given information, but typically, such functions might return a processed result based on the elements of the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0. The specific return value is not provided, but the function likely processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result based on the elements of the list.**
