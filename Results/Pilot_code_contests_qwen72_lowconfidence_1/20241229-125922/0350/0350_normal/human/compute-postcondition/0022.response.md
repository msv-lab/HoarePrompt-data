The code snippet `p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1` updates the value of `p[i]` based on the value of `p[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the specific impact of this line is:

- `p[2]` is updated to be `p[1] + 1`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `p[1]` could be either 1 or 2, depending on the condition `A[1] > 0`.
- `i` is 2.

Therefore, the new value of `p[2]` will be:
- If `A[1] > 0`, then `p[1] = 1`, so `p[2] = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- If `A[1] <= 0`, then `p[1] = 0`, so `p[2] = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, since `p[1]` is already determined based on the conditions given in the initial state, and assuming `p[1]` is already set correctly, we can generalize the update as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is 2, `p[2]` is `p[1] + 1`.**
