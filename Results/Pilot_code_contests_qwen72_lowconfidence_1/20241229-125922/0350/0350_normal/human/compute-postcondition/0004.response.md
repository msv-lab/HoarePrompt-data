The code snippet initializes two variables, `idx` and `size`. `idx` is set to 0, and `size` is set to the length of the map object `A`.

- `idx` is explicitly assigned the value 0.
- `size` is assigned the value of the length of the map object `A`.

The initial state specifies that `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input. Since `A` is a map object, calling `len(A)` will give the number of elements in the map.

Therefore, the output state includes:
- `n` remains an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0.
- `input` remains assigned to the function `sys.stdin.readline`.
- The recursion limit remains set to 10^6.
- `A` remains a map object containing integers read from the input.
- `idx` is now 0.
- `size` is now the length of the map object `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A`.**
