The code snippet sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This change affects the maximum depth of the Python interpreter's stack, allowing for deeper recursive calls. However, this does not alter the values of the variables `n`, `a`, or the assignment of `input`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6**
