Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be at least 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is `size`. For each index \(i\) in the range \(1 \leq i < size\), if \(A[i] > 0\), then \(p[i] = p[i-1] + 1\) and \(q[i] = q[i-1]\). Otherwise, if \(A[i] \leq 0\), then \(p[i] = q[i-1]\) and \(q[i] = p[i-1] + 1\).**
