The code snippet `p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1` updates the value of `p[i]` based on the previous value `p[i - 1]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is 1.
- `p` is a list of `size` zeros.
- `p[0]` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition `A[0] > 0`.

Let's calculate the new value of `p[1]`:

- `p[1] = p[0] + 1`

Since `p[0]` is either 1 or 0, `p[1]` will be either 2 or 1 respectively.

The output state will include the updated value of `p[1]` while keeping all other variables and conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be greater than 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements where `p[0]` is either 1 or 0 and `p[1]` is either 2 or 1, `q` is a list of `size` zeros, `i` is 1, and the current value of `A[i]` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `A[0] > 0`, then `p[0] = 1` and `q[0] = 0`; otherwise, if `A[0] <= 0`, then `p[0] = 0` and `q[0] = 1`.**
