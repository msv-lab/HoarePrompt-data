Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, `q` is a list of `size` zeros, and the first element of `A` is less than or equal to 0.**
