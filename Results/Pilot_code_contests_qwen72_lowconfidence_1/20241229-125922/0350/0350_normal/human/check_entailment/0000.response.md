Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when the input is a single negative number. According to the problem description, for a single negative number, the output should be `1 0` (since there is only one subsegment, and its product is negative). However, the current implementation will output `0 1`, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
-1
```
The expected output is:
```
1 0
```
But the program will output:
```
0 1
```
This indicates that the program does not correctly handle this edge case.
