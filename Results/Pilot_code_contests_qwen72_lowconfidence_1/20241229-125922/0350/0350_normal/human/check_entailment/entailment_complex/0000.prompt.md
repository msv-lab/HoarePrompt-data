You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import collections
import bisect
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9} and a_i ≠ 0.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)
    n = int(raw_input())
    A = map(int, input().split())
    idx, size = 0, len(A)
    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if (A[0] > 0) :
        p[0], q[0] = 1, 0
    else :
        q[0], p[0] = 1, 0
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer input from the user where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0, `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, recursion limit is set to 10^6, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A`, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` zeros, and `q` is a list of `size` zeros. If `A[0] > 0`, then `p[0] = 1` and `q[0] = 0`. Otherwise, if `A[0] <= 0`, then `p[0] = 0` and `q[0] = 1`.
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(a_i \neq 0\), `input` is assigned the function `sys.stdin.readline`, `A` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `idx` is 0, `size` is the length of the map object `A` and must be at least 1, `total` is `size * (1 + size) / 2`, `p` is a list of `size` elements, `q` is a list of `size` elements, `i` is `size`. For each index \(i\) in the range \(1 \leq i < size\), if \(A[i] > 0\), then \(p[i] = p[i-1] + 1\) and \(q[i] = q[i-1]\). Otherwise, if \(A[i] \leq 0\), then \(p[i] = q[i-1]\) and \(q[i] = p[i-1] + 1\).
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers from standard input, where each integer in `A` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0. It then processes the list `A` to compute two values: the sum of the number of negative-to-positive transitions and the sum of the number of positive-to-negative transitions in the list. These two values are printed as a pair of integers. The function does not return any value but instead prints the result directly. Edge cases include handling lists of length 1, where no transitions can occur, and ensuring that the initial state of `p[0]` and `q[0]` is correctly set based on the sign of the first element in `A`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
