You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n consisting of n non-zero integers (i.e. a_i ≠ 0). 

You have to calculate two following values:

  1. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is negative; 
  2. the number of pairs of indices (l, r) (l ≤ r) such that a_l ⋅ a_{l + 1} ... a_{r - 1} ⋅ a_r is positive; 

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of elements in the sequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^{9} ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}; a_i ≠ 0) — the elements of the sequence.

Output

Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.

    total = size * (1 + size) / 2
    p = [0] * size
    q = [0] * size
    if A[0] > 0:
        (p[0], q[0]) = (1, 0)
    else:
        (q[0], p[0]) = (1, 0)
    for i in xrange(1, size):
        if A[i] > 0:
            p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
            q[i] = q[i - 1]
        else:
            p[i] = q[i - 1]
            q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
    print('%s %s' % (sum(q), sum(p)))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It initializes the total number of subsegments as `total = n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the correct formula for the total number of subsegments in a sequence of length `n`.

2. **State Tracking**:
   - The program uses two arrays `p` and `q` to keep track of the number of subsegments ending at each index with a positive and negative product, respectively.
   - The initial values of `p[0]` and `q[0]` are set based on the sign of the first element `A[0]`.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each subsequent element in the array, the program updates the `p` and `q` arrays based on the sign of the current element and the previous values of `p` and `q`.
   - If the current element is positive, it extends the subsegments with the same sign as the previous element.
   - If the current element is negative, it swaps the counts of positive and negative subsegments and increments the count of negative subsegments.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the `q` array (number of subsegments with a negative product) and the sum of the `p` array (number of subsegments with a positive product).

The program handles all edge cases and inputs within the specified constraints. I could not find any input or edge case where the program would produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers from standard input, where each integer in `A` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and a_i ≠ 0. It then processes the list `A` to compute two values: the sum of the number of negative-to-positive transitions and the sum of the number of positive-to-negative transitions in the list. These two values are printed as a pair of integers. The function does not return any value but instead prints the result directly. Edge cases include handling lists of length 1, where no transitions can occur, and ensuring that the initial state of `p[0]` and `q[0]` is correctly set based on the sign of the first element in `A`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
