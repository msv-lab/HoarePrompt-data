Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly compute the number of subsegments with negative and positive products as required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Product Calculation**:
   - The program uses arrays `p` and `q` to keep track of the number of positive and negative products, respectively. However, the logic for updating these arrays is flawed. Specifically, the way `p` and `q` are updated does not correctly account for the product of subsegments.

2. **Misinterpretation of Transitions**:
   - The program seems to be counting transitions between positive and negative numbers, rather than the actual products of subsegments. This is evident from the lines:
     ```python
     if A[i] > 0:
         p[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
         q[i] = q[i - 1]
     else:
         p[i] = q[i - 1]
         q[i] = p[i - 1] + 1
     ```
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the cumulative product of subsegments.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     5 -3 3 -1 1
     ```
   - The correct output should be:
     ```
     8 7
     ```
   - However, the program's logic will produce a different result because it incorrectly counts transitions rather than subsegment products.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to properly calculate the number of subsegments with negative and positive products by considering the cumulative product of subsegments and handling edge cases appropriately. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.
