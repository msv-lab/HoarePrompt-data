n and d are integers where 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000. The log of messages is a list of n strings, each formatted as "Ai Bi ti", where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') up to 20 characters long, and ti is an integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000) representing the time of the message. The messages are in non-decreasing order of ti, and no user sends a message to themselves.
