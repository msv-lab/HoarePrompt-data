#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000. The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti.

    n, d = map(int, raw_input().split())

    data = [[]] * n
    for i in range(0, n):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the number of lines in the log. `res` is a set containing strings of the form `data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]` for all pairs of messages where `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` and `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `i` and `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` with `j > i`. If no such pairs exist, `res` remains an empty set.

        print(l)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a set of strings representing pairs of messages `[sender Ai, receiver Bi]` that satisfy the condition `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `i` and `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` with `j > i`. If no such pairs exist, `res` is an empty set. Each element in `res` has been printed exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000`. It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender (`Ai`), receiver (`Bi`), and time (`ti`) of a message. The function processes these logs to identify pairs of messages where the sender and receiver are swapped, and the time difference between the messages is within the range `(0, d]`. The function prints the number of unique pairs of users who exchanged messages meeting these criteria, followed by the pairs themselves. If no such pairs exist, it prints 0 and no additional lines. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results to the console. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no messages meet the criteria, or where multiple pairs of messages involve the same users. The function assumes that no user sends a message to themselves and that the log is provided in non-decreasing order of time.
