n and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000. The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti.
