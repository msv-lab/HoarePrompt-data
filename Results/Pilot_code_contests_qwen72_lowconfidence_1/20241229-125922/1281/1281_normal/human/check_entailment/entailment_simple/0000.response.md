Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `n` is the number of messages and `d` is the maximum allowed time difference for messages to be considered as responses.
   - It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender, receiver, and time of the message. These are stored in a list of lists called `data`.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - The `data` list is structured such that each element is a list containing the sender, receiver, and time of a message.
   - The time is converted to an integer to facilitate comparison.

3. **Friendship Determination:**
   - The program iterates through all pairs of messages to check if they meet the criteria for friendship.
   - For each pair of messages, it checks if the sender of the first message is the receiver of the second message and vice versa.
   - It also checks if the time difference between the two messages is within the allowed range (0 < t2 - t1 â‰¤ d).
   - If both conditions are met, the pair of users is added to the set `res`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of unique pairs of friends.
   - It then prints each pair of friends.

### Why It Meets the Requirements:

- **Correct Parsing of Input:** The program correctly reads and parses the input according to the specified format.
- **Correct Logic for Friendship:** The logic for determining friendships is implemented correctly. It checks the necessary conditions (sender-receiver roles and time difference) and adds valid pairs to the set.
- **Unique Pairs:** The use of a set ensures that each pair of friends is printed only once.
- **Output Format:** The output format matches the problem description, printing the number of pairs followed by the pairs themselves.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **No Messages:** If `n` is 1, the program will correctly output 0 pairs of friends.
- **Messages in Order:** The input is guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order of time, so the program does not need to sort the messages.
- **No Self-Messages:** The problem guarantees that no user sends a message to themselves, so the program does not need to handle this case.

Given these points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
