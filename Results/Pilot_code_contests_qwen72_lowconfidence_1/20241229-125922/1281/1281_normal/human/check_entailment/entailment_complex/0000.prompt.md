You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarpus has a hobby — he develops an unusual social network. His work is almost completed, and there is only one more module to implement — the module which determines friends. Oh yes, in this social network one won't have to add friends manually! Pairs of friends are deduced in the following way. Let's assume that user A sent user B a message at time t1, and user B sent user A a message at time t2. If 0 < t2 - t1 ≤ d, then user B's message was an answer to user A's one. Users A and B are considered to be friends if A answered at least one B's message or B answered at least one A's message.

You are given the log of messages in chronological order and a number d. Find all pairs of users who will be considered to be friends.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000). The next n lines contain the messages log. The i-th line contains one line of the log formatted as "Ai Bi ti" (without the quotes), which means that user Ai sent a message to user Bi at time ti (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Ai and Bi are non-empty strings at most 20 characters long, consisting of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z'), and ti is an integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000). It is guaranteed that the lines are given in non-decreasing order of ti's and that no user sent a message to himself. The elements in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output

In the first line print integer k — the number of pairs of friends. In the next k lines print pairs of friends as "Ai Bi" (without the quotes). You can print users in pairs and the pairs themselves in any order. Each pair must be printed exactly once.

Examples

Input

4 1
vasya petya 1
petya vasya 2
anya ivan 2
ivan anya 4


Output

1
petya vasya


Input

1 1000
a b 0


Output

0

Note

In the first sample test case Vasya and Petya are friends because their messages' sending times are one second apart. Anya and Ivan are not, because their messages' sending times differ by more than one second.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000. The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti.
def func():
    n, d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = set()
    data = [[]] * n
    for i in range(0, n):
        data[i] = raw_input().split()
        
        data[i][2] = int(data[i][2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, each list in `data` contains three elements [sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer], `i` is n-1, `n` is the number of lines in the log.
    for i in range(0, n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if data[i][0] == data[j][1] and data[i][1] == data[j][0] and 0 < abs(
                data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d:
                res |= {data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]}
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the number of lines in the log. `res` is a set containing strings of the form `data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]` for all pairs of messages where `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` and `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `i` and `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` with `j > i`. If no such pairs exist, `res` remains an empty set.
    print(len(res))
    for l in res:
        print(l)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is a set of strings representing pairs of messages `[sender Ai, receiver Bi]` that satisfy the condition `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `i` and `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` with `j > i`. If no such pairs exist, `res` is an empty set. Each element in `res` has been printed exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000`. It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender (`Ai`), receiver (`Bi`), and time (`ti`) of a message. The function processes these logs to identify pairs of messages where the sender and receiver are swapped, and the time difference between the messages is within the range `(0, d]`. The function prints the number of unique pairs of users who exchanged messages meeting these criteria, followed by the pairs themselves. If no such pairs exist, it prints 0 and no additional lines. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results to the console. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no messages meet the criteria, or where multiple pairs of messages involve the same users. The function assumes that no user sends a message to themselves and that the log is provided in non-decreasing order of time.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
