Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000`.
   - It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender (`Ai`), receiver (`Bi`), and time (`ti`) of a message. These inputs are stored in a list of lists called `data`.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - The program iterates over all pairs of messages in the log.
   - For each pair of messages, it checks if the sender and receiver are swapped and if the time difference between the messages is within the range `(0, d]`.
   - If the conditions are met, the pair of users is added to the set `res`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of unique pairs of users who exchanged messages meeting the criteria.
   - It then prints each pair of users.

### Key Points:

- **Correct Handling of Input:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem description.
  - It ensures that the log is provided in non-decreasing order of time, which is a valid assumption as per the problem description.

- **Correct Logic for Identifying Friends:**
  - The nested loops ensure that all pairs of messages are checked.
  - The conditions `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` check if the sender and receiver are swapped.
  - The condition `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` ensures that the time difference is within the specified range.

- **Unique Pairs:**
  - Using a set `res` ensures that each pair of users is counted only once, even if they exchange multiple messages within the time range.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program correctly prints the number of unique pairs and then prints each pair in the required format.

### Edge Cases:

- **No Messages Meeting the Criteria:**
  - If no messages meet the criteria, the set `res` remains empty, and the program correctly prints `0` and no additional lines.

- **Multiple Pairs Involving the Same Users:**
  - The use of a set ensures that each pair is printed only once, even if there are multiple messages between the same users.

Given that the program correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
