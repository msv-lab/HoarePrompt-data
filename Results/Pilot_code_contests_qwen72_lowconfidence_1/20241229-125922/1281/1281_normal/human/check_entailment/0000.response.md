Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a potential issue with how it initializes the `data` list. Specifically, the line `data = [[]] * n` creates a list of `n` references to the same empty list. This means that when the program tries to modify `data[i]` in the loop, it inadvertently modifies all elements in the `data` list, leading to incorrect behavior.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
vasya petya 1
petya vasya 2
anya ivan 2
ivan anya 4
```

When the program processes the first message, it sets `data[0]` to `['vasya', 'petya', 1]`. However, because all elements in `data` are references to the same list, `data` becomes:
```
[['vasya', 'petya', 1], ['vasya', 'petya', 1], ['vasya', 'petya', 1], ['vasya', 'petya', 1]]
```

This incorrect initialization causes the program to fail in identifying the correct pairs of friends. To fix this, the initialization should be changed to:
```python
data = [None] * n
```

And then in the loop:
```python
data[i] = raw_input().split()
data[i][2] = int(data[i][2])
```

This ensures that each element in `data` is a separate list, and the program will work correctly for all potential cases.
