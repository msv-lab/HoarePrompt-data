Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain cases. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code handles the identification of friend pairs. The current implementation only checks pairs of messages in a sequential manner, which can miss valid friend pairs if they are not adjacent in the input log.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
5 1
vasya petya 1
petya vasya 2
petya vasya 3
vasya petya 4
anya ivan 5
```

Expected Output:
```
1
petya vasya
```

Actual Output:
```
2
petya vasya
vasya petya
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
- The code correctly identifies the first pair of messages between `vasya` and `petya` at times 1 and 2.
- However, it also incorrectly identifies the second pair of messages at times 3 and 4 as a new friendship, even though the same users are involved.

### Correct Approach:
To fix this, the code should ensure that each pair of users is only counted once, regardless of how many times they exchange messages within the allowed time window. One way to achieve this is to use a set to store unique pairs of friends and ensure that the order of the pair (i.e., "A B" and "B A") is consistent.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def func():
    (n, d) = map(int, input().split())
    res = set()
    data = []
    for _ in range(n):
        data.append(input().split())
        data[-1][2] = int(data[-1][2])
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if data[i][0] == data[j][1] and data[i][1] == data[j][0] and 0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d:
                # Ensure the pair is stored consistently
                pair = tuple(sorted((data[i][0], data[i][1])))
                res.add(pair)
    
    print(len(res))
    for pair in res:
        print(' '.join(pair))
```

This fix ensures that each pair of friends is counted only once, and the output is consistent with the problem description.
