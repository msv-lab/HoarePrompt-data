You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarpus has a hobby — he develops an unusual social network. His work is almost completed, and there is only one more module to implement — the module which determines friends. Oh yes, in this social network one won't have to add friends manually! Pairs of friends are deduced in the following way. Let's assume that user A sent user B a message at time t1, and user B sent user A a message at time t2. If 0 < t2 - t1 ≤ d, then user B's message was an answer to user A's one. Users A and B are considered to be friends if A answered at least one B's message or B answered at least one A's message.

You are given the log of messages in chronological order and a number d. Find all pairs of users who will be considered to be friends.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000). The next n lines contain the messages log. The i-th line contains one line of the log formatted as "Ai Bi ti" (without the quotes), which means that user Ai sent a message to user Bi at time ti (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Ai and Bi are non-empty strings at most 20 characters long, consisting of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z'), and ti is an integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000). It is guaranteed that the lines are given in non-decreasing order of ti's and that no user sent a message to himself. The elements in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output

In the first line print integer k — the number of pairs of friends. In the next k lines print pairs of friends as "Ai Bi" (without the quotes). You can print users in pairs and the pairs themselves in any order. Each pair must be printed exactly once.

Examples

Input

4 1
vasya petya 1
petya vasya 2
anya ivan 2
ivan anya 4


Output

1
petya vasya


Input

1 1000
a b 0


Output

0

Note

In the first sample test case Vasya and Petya are friends because their messages' sending times are one second apart. Anya and Ivan are not, because their messages' sending times differ by more than one second.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    res = set()
    data = [[]] * n
    for i in range(0, n):
        data[i] = raw_input().split()
        data[i][2] = int(data[i][2])
    for i in range(0, n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if data[i][0] == data[j][1] and data[i][1] == data[j][0] and (0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d):
                res |= {data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]}
    print(len(res))
    for l in res:
        print(l)


```
Output hints: The function reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000`. It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender (`Ai`), receiver (`Bi`), and time (`ti`) of a message. The function processes these logs to identify pairs of messages where the sender and receiver are swapped, and the time difference between the messages is within the range `(0, d]`. The function prints the number of unique pairs of users who exchanged messages meeting these criteria, followed by the pairs themselves. If no such pairs exist, it prints 0 and no additional lines. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results to the console. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no messages meet the criteria, or where multiple pairs of messages involve the same users. The function assumes that no user sends a message to themselves and that the log is provided in non-decreasing order of time.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
