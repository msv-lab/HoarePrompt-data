The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `d`, and a list representing the log of messages. 

- `n` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000.
- The log of messages is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where `Ai` and `Bi` are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of `ti`.

The function returns the number of distinct users who received at least one message within the last `d` units of time from any other user.
