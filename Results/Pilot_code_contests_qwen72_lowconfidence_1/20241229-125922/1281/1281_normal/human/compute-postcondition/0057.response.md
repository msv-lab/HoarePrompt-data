Output State: **`res` is a set of strings representing pairs of messages `[sender Ai, receiver Bi]` that satisfy the condition `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `i` and `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` with `j > i`. If no such pairs exist, `res` is an empty set. Each element in `res` has been printed exactly once.**
