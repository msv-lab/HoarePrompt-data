The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `d` using the `map` function and `raw_input`. The `raw_input` function reads a line of input from the user, and `map` applies the `int` function to split this line into two integers.

Given the initial state where `n` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000, the new values of `n` and `d` will be those read from the input, but they must still satisfy the same constraints.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti.**
