The code snippet `res |= {data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]}` modifies the set `res` by adding a new element to it. This new element is a string formed by concatenating the first and second elements of the list located at `data[i]`, separated by a space.

Given the initial state:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

We need to evaluate the code snippet in this context:

1. **`res`**: The set `res` is updated by adding a new element. The new element is constructed by concatenating `data[i][0]` and `data[i][1]` with a space in between.
2. **`data[i]`**: Since `i` is 0, we are accessing `data[0]`. The first and second elements of `data[0]` are concatenated to form a string.
3. **`res` Update**: The new string is added to the set `res`.

Let's assume `data[0]` is a list with two elements, say `['a', 'b']`. The new element added to `res` would be `'a b'`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` remains 0, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `res` contains the element `'a b'` (assuming `data[0]` is `['a', 'b']`).**
