The code snippet `data[i][2] = int(data[i][2])` converts the third element of the list `data[i]` (which is currently a string) into an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000
- The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000)
- `res` is an empty set
- `data` is a list of n lists
- `data[0]` is a list of three elements [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer]
- `data[1]` is a list of three elements [sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer]
- `data[2]` is a list of three strings from the input line
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet:
- The third element of `data[2]` is converted to an integer.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, `data[0]` is a list of three elements [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer], `data[1]` is a list of three elements [sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer], `data[2]` is a list of three elements [sender A2, receiver B2, time t2 as an integer], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
