To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `d` is an integer read from input, where 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000.
- The log of messages is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000).
- `res` is an empty set.
- `data` is a list of `n` lists.
  - `data[0]` is a list of three elements `[sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer]`.
  - `data[1]` is a list of three elements `[sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to execute again, so `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, `data[0]` is a list of three elements [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer], `data[1]` is a list of three elements [sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
