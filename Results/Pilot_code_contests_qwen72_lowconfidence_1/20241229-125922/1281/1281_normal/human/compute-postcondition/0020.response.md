Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000). `res` is a set that may contain the string `data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]` if the condition `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` and `(0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d)` is satisfied. `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If the condition `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` and `(0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d)` is true, `res` now contains the string `data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]` in addition to any existing elements.***
