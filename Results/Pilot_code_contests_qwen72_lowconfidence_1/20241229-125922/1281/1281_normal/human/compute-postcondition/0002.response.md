The code initializes a list named `data` with `n` elements, where each element is an empty list. This means `data` is now a list of `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti, `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
