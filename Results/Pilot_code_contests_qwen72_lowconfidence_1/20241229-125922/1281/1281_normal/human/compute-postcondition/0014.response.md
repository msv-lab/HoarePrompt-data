To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000
- The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000)
- `res` is an empty set
- `data` is a list of n lists, each list in `data` contains three elements [sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i + 1, n)`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is 0.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `n`. This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1).

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `i` is already 0, which is correct.
- `j` will start from 1 and go up to `n - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, each list in `data` contains three elements [sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer], `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
