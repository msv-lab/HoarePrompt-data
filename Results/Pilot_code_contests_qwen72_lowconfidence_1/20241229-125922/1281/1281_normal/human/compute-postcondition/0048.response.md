Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `log` is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. `res` is a set containing strings of the form `data[i][0] + ' ' + data[i][1]` for all pairs of messages where `data[i][0] == data[j][1]` and `data[i][1] == data[j][0]` and `0 < abs(data[i][2] - data[j][2]) <= d` for all valid `j` in the range `i + 1` to `n - 1`. If no such pairs exist, `res` remains an empty set.**
