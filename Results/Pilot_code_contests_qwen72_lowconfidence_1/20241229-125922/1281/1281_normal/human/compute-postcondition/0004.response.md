The line `data[i] = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then stored in `data[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so this operation updates the first element of the `data` list.

- `data[0]` is now a list of three strings: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti`.
- The values of `n`, `d`, `log of messages`, `res`, `data`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the modification to `data[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), where Ai and Bi are non-empty strings of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z') at most 20 characters long, and no user sends a message to themselves. The log is provided in non-decreasing order of ti, `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, `data[0]` is a list of three strings [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0], `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0.**
