Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `d` from the input, where `1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000`. It then reads `n` lines of message logs, each containing the sender (`Ai`), receiver (`Bi`), and time (`ti`) of a message. The function processes these logs to identify pairs of messages where the sender and receiver are swapped, and the time difference between the messages is within the range `(0, d]`. The function prints the number of unique pairs of users who exchanged messages meeting these criteria, followed by the pairs themselves. If no such pairs exist, it prints 0 and no additional lines. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results to the console. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no messages meet the criteria, or where multiple pairs of messages involve the same users. The function assumes that no user sends a message to themselves and that the log is provided in non-decreasing order of time. **
