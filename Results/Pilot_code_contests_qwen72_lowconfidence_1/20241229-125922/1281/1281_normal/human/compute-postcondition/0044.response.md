Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `log` is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3. If `data[2][0] == data[3][1]` and `data[2][1] == data[3][0]` and `0 < abs(data[2][2] - data[3][2]) <= d`, then the string `data[2][0] + ' ' + data[2][1]` is added to `res`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
