Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, `log` is a list of `n` lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender `Ai`, the receiver `Bi`, and the time `ti` (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is a set, `data` is a list of `n` lists, each list in `data` contains three elements `[sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer]`, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `data[i][0]` is equal to `data[j][1]`, `data[i][1]` is equal to `data[j][0]`, and the absolute difference between `data[i][2]` and `data[j][2]` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `d`.**
