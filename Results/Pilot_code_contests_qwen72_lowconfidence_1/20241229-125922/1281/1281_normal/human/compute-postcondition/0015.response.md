Postcondition: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, each list in `data` contains three elements [sender Ai, receiver Bi, time ti as an integer], `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current values of `i` and `j` satisfy the condition that `data[i][0]` (sender at index i) is equal to `data[j][1]` (receiver at index j), `data[i][1]` (receiver at index i) is equal to `data[j][0]` (sender at index j), and the absolute difference between `data[i][2]` (time at index i) and `data[j][2]` (time at index j) is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `d`.**
