The code snippet `data[i] = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to `data[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000
- The log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000)
- `res` is an empty set
- `data` is a list of n lists
- `data[0]` is a list of three elements [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer]
- `data[1]` is a list of three elements [sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer]
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

After executing the code snippet, `data[2]` will be updated with the split input line. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `d` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000, the log of messages is a list of n lines, each containing three space-separated values: the sender Ai, the receiver Bi, and the time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000), `res` is an empty set, `data` is a list of n lists, `data[0]` is a list of three elements [sender A0, receiver B0, time t0 as an integer], `data[1]` is a list of three elements [sender A1, receiver B1, time t1 as an integer], `data[2]` is a list of three strings from the input line, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
