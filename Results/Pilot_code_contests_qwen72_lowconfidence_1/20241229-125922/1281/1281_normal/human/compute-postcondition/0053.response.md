According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `res`. If `res` has elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains at least one element, and `l` has been printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element after the current element `l` has been processed. Therefore, `res` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`res` contains at least two elements, `l` has been printed.**
