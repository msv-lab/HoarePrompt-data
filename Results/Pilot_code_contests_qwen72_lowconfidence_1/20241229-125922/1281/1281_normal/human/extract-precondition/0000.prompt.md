You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Polycarpus has a hobby — he develops an unusual social network. His work is almost completed, and there is only one more module to implement — the module which determines friends. Oh yes, in this social network one won't have to add friends manually! Pairs of friends are deduced in the following way. Let's assume that user A sent user B a message at time t1, and user B sent user A a message at time t2. If 0 < t2 - t1 ≤ d, then user B's message was an answer to user A's one. Users A and B are considered to be friends if A answered at least one B's message or B answered at least one A's message.

You are given the log of messages in chronological order and a number d. Find all pairs of users who will be considered to be friends.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000). The next n lines contain the messages log. The i-th line contains one line of the log formatted as "Ai Bi ti" (without the quotes), which means that user Ai sent a message to user Bi at time ti (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Ai and Bi are non-empty strings at most 20 characters long, consisting of lowercase letters ('a' ... 'z'), and ti is an integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10000). It is guaranteed that the lines are given in non-decreasing order of ti's and that no user sent a message to himself. The elements in the lines are separated by single spaces.

Output

In the first line print integer k — the number of pairs of friends. In the next k lines print pairs of friends as "Ai Bi" (without the quotes). You can print users in pairs and the pairs themselves in any order. Each pair must be printed exactly once.

Examples

Input

4 1
vasya petya 1
petya vasya 2
anya ivan 2
ivan anya 4


Output

1
petya vasya


Input

1 1000
a b 0


Output

0

Note

In the first sample test case Vasya and Petya are friends because their messages' sending times are one second apart. Anya and Ivan are not, because their messages' sending times differ by more than one second.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
