The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not handle negative values for `n` or `m`, and passing such values would result in an empty list.
