The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a non-zero power of 2; otherwise, it returns `False`. Specifically, it correctly identifies `x` as a power of 2 if `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 0 by returning `False`, as 0 is not a power of 2.
