args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args, 'file' is a stream object where the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
