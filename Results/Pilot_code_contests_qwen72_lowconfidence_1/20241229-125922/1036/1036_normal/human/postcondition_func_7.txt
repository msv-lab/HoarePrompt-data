The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order based on the key obtained from the `getKey` function. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and works correctly to extract the sorting key from each element. If `getKey` raises an exception for any element in `l`, the function will also raise an exception. If `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.
