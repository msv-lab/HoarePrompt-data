The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional note that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt` remain as initially defined, `i` is the next element in `p`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
