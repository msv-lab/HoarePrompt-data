Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt` remain as initially defined, `i` is the next element in `p`, `k & i` must be checked, `fx.get(i, 0)` and `fy.get(k // i, 0)` must be checked, if `k % i == 0` and `k & i != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `fx[i] * fy[k // i]`.***
