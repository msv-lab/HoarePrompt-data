To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to run. The loop in question is:

```python
for i in range(len(p) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `p` in reverse order.
   - The loop will execute if `len(p)` is greater than 0. This is because the loop starts at `len(p) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches -1.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `p` is a list containing all unique non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `p` must contain at least one element (i.e., `len(p) > 0`).

### Adjusted State:

- `p` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The initial state of `i` should be `len(p) - 1`.

### Final State:

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`. `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop. `p` is a list containing all unique non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]` and must have at least one element. `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in the original `p`. `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0. `q` is a list containing all non-zero values of `y[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, m-1]`. `fy` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each unique value in `q`. `q` is now a list of unique non-zero values from `q`. `cnt` is 0. `i` is `len(p) - 1`.**
