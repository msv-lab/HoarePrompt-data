Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`. If `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`. If `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0. All other elements of `x` are set to 0. If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0. The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist. `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, and `i` is 2.***
