Functionality: ** The function `func_19` prints the values in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' if they exist. After execution, the values in `args` are written to the stream, separated by the specified separator (or a space by default), followed by the specified end character (or a newline by default). If the 'flush' key in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, which results in only the end character being written to the stream, and the absence of certain keys in `kwargs`, which use their default values. **
