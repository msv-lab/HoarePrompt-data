Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt` remain as initially defined. If `k % i == 0`, and the bitwise AND of `k` and `i` is not equal to 0, and `fx.get(i, 0)` is not 0, and `fy.get(k // i, 0)` is not 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + fx[i] * fy[k // i]`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
