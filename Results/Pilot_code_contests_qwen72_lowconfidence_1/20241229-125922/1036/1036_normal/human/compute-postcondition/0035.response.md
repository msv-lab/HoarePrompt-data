Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`
- `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`
- If `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`
- If `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0
- All other elements of `x` are set to 0
- If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0
- The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist
- `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0
- `q` is an empty list
- `i` is 3

Code:
```
x[i] += x[i - 1] + a[i]
```

Impact:
- The value of `x[3]` is updated by adding `x[2]` and `a[3]` to its current value.

Calculations:
- Since `i` is 3, `x[3]` is updated to `x[3] + x[2] + a[3]`.

Output State:
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`
- `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`
- `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`
- If `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`
- If `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0
- All other elements of `x` are set to 0 except `x[3]` which is now `x[3] + x[2] + a[3]`
- If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0
- The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist
- `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0
- `q` is an empty list
- `i` is 3
