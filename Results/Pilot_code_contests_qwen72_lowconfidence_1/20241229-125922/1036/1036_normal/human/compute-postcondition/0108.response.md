The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. It does not alter the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop. Since the `continue` statement is encountered, the program will skip the rest of the code block within the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain as initially defined. The bitwise AND of `k` and `i` is not equal to 0, and either `fx.get(i, 0)` is 0 or `fy.get(k // i, 0)` is 0. The current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins.**
