Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, the dictionary `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in `p`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is not 0, `y[1]` is now `b[0] + b[1]`. If `fy.get(y[1], 0) == 0`, then `fy` now has `b[0] + b[1]` as a key with value 1. Otherwise, `fy` has the key `y[1]` (which is `b[0] + b[1]`) with its value incremented by 1.***
