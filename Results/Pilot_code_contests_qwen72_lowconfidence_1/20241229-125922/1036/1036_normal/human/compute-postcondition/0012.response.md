`file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. Since `str(x)` has already been written to `file` and `at_start` is False, this means that `str(x)` and `sep` have been written to `file`. The new call to `file.write(str(x))` will write `str(x)` again to `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple containing at least two values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `str(x)` and `sep` have been written to `file`, followed by another `str(x)`.**
