Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not, `at_start` is False (if `args` is not empty), `str(args[0])` through `str(args[-1])` have been written to `file` separated by `sep` (if `args` contains more than one element). If `args` is empty, `at_start` remains True and nothing is written to `file`.**
