The code `q.append(y[i])` appends the value of `y[i]` to the list `q`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `y[3]` is appended to `q`.

Let's summarize the impact of this code:

1. **`q`**: Initially, `q` is a list with the first element being `b[0] + b[2]` and the second element being `y[2]`. After appending `y[3]`, the new list `q` will be `[b[0] + b[2], y[2], y[3]]`.

2. **Other Variables**: All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `p`, `fx`, `y`, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `b[2]` conditions, `fy` updates) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in `p`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, if `b[2]` is not 0: `y[2]` is `b[0] + 2 * b[2]`, `q` is a list with the first element being `b[0] + b[2]`, the second element being `y[2]`, and the third element being `y[3]`, `fy` has the key `b[0] + b[2]` with its value incremented by 1, and if `fy.get(y[2], 0) == 0`, `fy[y[2]]` is set to 1; otherwise, `fy[b[0] + 2 * b[2]]` is incremented by 1, if `b[2]` is 0: `y[2]` remains 0, `q` and `fy` retain their initial states as described in the precondition, and `fy[0]` is incremented by 1, `y[3]` is `y[2] + b[3]`, and if `fy.get(y[3], 0) == 0`, `fy[y[3]]` is set to 1; otherwise, `fy[y[3]]` is incremented by 1.**
