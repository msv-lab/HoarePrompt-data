Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain as initially defined. If the bitwise AND of `k` and `i` is not equal to 0, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `fx.get(i, 0)` is 0 or `fy.get(k // i, 0)` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins.***
