The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within this specific execution of the code block. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt` remain as initially defined, `i` is the next element in `p`, `k & i` must be checked, `fx.get(i, 0)` and `fy.get(k // i, 0)` must be checked, if `k % i == 0` and `k & i != 0`, `ans` is incremented by `fx[i] * fy[k // i]`.**
