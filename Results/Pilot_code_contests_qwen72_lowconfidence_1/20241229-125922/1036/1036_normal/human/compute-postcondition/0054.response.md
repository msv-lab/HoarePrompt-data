Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, the dictionary `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in `p`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, if `y[0]` is 1, `q` is a list containing `[1]` and `fy` is a dictionary with the key `1` set to `1`, otherwise `q` remains an empty list and `fy` remains an empty dictionary, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is not 0, `y[1]` is now `b[0] + b[1]`, and `fy.get(y[i], 0)` is not 0.**
