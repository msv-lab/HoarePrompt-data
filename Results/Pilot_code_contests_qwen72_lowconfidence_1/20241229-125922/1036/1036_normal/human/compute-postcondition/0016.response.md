Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least three values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element in `args`, and if `at_start` is False, `sep` has been written to `file`. In all cases, `str(x)` and `sep` will be written to `file`, followed by another `str(x)`.***
