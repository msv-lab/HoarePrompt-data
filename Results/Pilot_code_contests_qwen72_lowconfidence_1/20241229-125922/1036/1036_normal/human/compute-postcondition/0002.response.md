The code snippet initializes the variable `at_start` to `True`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file`). 

Therefore, the Output State is: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end', and 'flush', sep is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, file is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not, at_start is True**.
