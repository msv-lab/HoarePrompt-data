Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `x` has at least one non-zero value in the range `[1, n-1]`, `p` is a list containing at least one unique non-zero value from `x[1:n-1]`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt` remain as initially defined, `i` is the next element in `p`. If `k & i` is not equal to 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `fx.get(i, 0) == 0` or `fy.get(k // i, 0) == 0`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
