Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`, `x[2]` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is `a[2]`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `p` remains as defined in the initial state. If `fx.get(x[2], 0) == 0`, then `fx[x[2]]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `fx[x[2]]` is incremented by 1.***
