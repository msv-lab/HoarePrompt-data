To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` must be greater than 2.
  - `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
  - `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`.
  - `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`.
  - If `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`.
  - If `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0.
  - All other elements of `x` are set to 0.
  - If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0.
  - The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist.
  - `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0.
  - `q` is an empty list.
  - `i` is 2.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- **Increment `i` by 1**: Since `i` is currently 2, it should be incremented to 3.
- **Ensure `n` is greater than 3**: Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3.
- All other variables (`m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `p`, `fx`, `y`, `q`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`. If `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`. If `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0. All other elements of `x` are set to 0. If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0. The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist. `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, and `i` is 3.**
