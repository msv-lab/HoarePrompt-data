To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:

- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

All other variables (`m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `p`, `fx`, `y`, `q`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the increment of `i` or the loop condition.

### Final State:

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`. If `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) is not 0, then `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and all other elements of `x` are set to 0. If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]`; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]`. The dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist. If `a[i]` is 0, then `x[1]` is set to 0, and all other elements of `x` are set to 0. If the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1]`; otherwise, `p` is an empty list. `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, and `i` is 2.**
