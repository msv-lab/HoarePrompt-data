Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in `p`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, `q` is a list containing all non-zero values of `y[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, m-1]`, `fy` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each unique value in `q`. If `b[i]` is not 0 for any `i` in the range `[1, m-1]`, `y[i]` is set to the cumulative sum of non-zero `b` values up to index `i`, and `q` and `fy` are updated accordingly. If all `b[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, m-1]` are 0, `y` remains unchanged, and `q` and `fy` retain their initial states as described in the precondition.**
