The code snippet `p.append(x[i])` adds the value of `x[i]` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is 3, `x[3]` will be appended to `p`.

Let's summarize the changes and the final state:

- `p` is updated to include the value of `x[3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`, if `a[1]` is not 0, `x[1]` is set to `a[0] + a[1]`, and `x[2]` is set to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is set to `a[2]`, if `a[1]` is 0, `x[1]` and `x[2]` are both set to 0, all other elements of `x` are set to 0 except `x[3]` which is now `x[3] + x[2] + a[3]`, if the first element of `x` is 1, then `p` is `[1, a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or `[1]` if `a[1]` is 0; otherwise, `p` is `[a[0] + a[1]]` if `a[1]` is not 0, or an empty list if `a[1]` is 0, the dictionary `fx` is updated such that the key `a[0] + a[1]` has a value of 1 if it does not already exist in `fx`, or its value is incremented by 1 if it does exist, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `p` is now `p` with `x[3]` appended to it. If `fx.get(x[3], 0) == 0`, then `fx[x[3]]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `fx[x[3]]` is incremented by 1.**
