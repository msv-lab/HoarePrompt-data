Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' but not 'end'. `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not. `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not. `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty. The value of `'end'` in `kwargs` or `'\n'` if `'end'` was not in `kwargs` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs` contained the key 'flush' and its value was `True`, then `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'flush' and the buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
