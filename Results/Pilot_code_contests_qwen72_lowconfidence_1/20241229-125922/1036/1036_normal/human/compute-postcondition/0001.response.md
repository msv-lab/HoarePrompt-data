The code snippet assigns values to `sep` and `file` using the `pop` method on the `kwargs` dictionary. The `pop` method removes the specified key from the dictionary and returns its value. If the key is not found, it returns the default value provided as the second argument.

- `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise it defaults to `' '`.
- `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

After this assignment, the keys `'sep'` and `'file'` are removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end', and 'flush', sep is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, file is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not.**
