The code snippet `cnt = fx[p[i]]` assigns the value of `fx[p[i]]` to the variable `cnt`.

- `fx[p[i]]`: This accesses the frequency count of the element `p[i]` in the dictionary `fx`.
- `i`: This is `len(p) - 3`.

Therefore, `cnt` is now the frequency count of the third-to-last element in the list `p` according to the dictionary `fx`.

The output state reflects this change:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`. `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop. `p` is a list containing all unique non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]` and must have at least one element. `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in the original `p`. `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0. `q` is a list containing all non-zero values of `y[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, m-1]`. `fy` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each unique value in `q`. `q` is now a list of unique non-zero values from `q`. `cnt` is the frequency count of the third-to-last element in `p` according to `fx`. `i` is `len(p) - 3`.**
