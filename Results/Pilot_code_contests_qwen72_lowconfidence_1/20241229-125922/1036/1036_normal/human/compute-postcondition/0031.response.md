The code snippet `p.append(x[i])` appends the value of `x[i]` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 2, so `x[i]` is `x[2]`.
- `x[2]` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is `a[2]`.
- `p` is initially an empty list, so after appending `x[2]`, `p` will contain `[x[2]]`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `q`, `i`, and `fx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `m` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` with the first element set to `a[0]`, `x[2]` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` is not 0, otherwise `x[2]` is `a[2]`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with all elements set to 0, `q` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `p` is `[x[2]]`, `fx` is updated as described in the initial state.**
