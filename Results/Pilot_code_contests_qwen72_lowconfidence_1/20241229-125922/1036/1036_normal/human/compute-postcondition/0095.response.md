To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `q` in reverse order.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(q) - 1`.
- `q` must have at least one element.
- `cnt` is the frequency count of the last element in `q` as per `fy`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(q) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(q) - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Decrement `i`**: Since `i` is currently `len(q) - 1`, it will be decremented to `len(q) - 2` for the next iteration.
- **Check `q` Length**: The list `q` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time. This ensures that `i` can be decremented without going out of bounds.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `len(q) - 2`.
- `q` must have at least two elements.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `p`, `fx`, `y`, `q`, `fy`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged, except for the fact that `i` has been decremented.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all unique non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in the original `p`, with each value incremented by the cumulative sum of the frequencies of the elements processed in previous iterations, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, `q` is a list containing all non-zero values of `y[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, m-1]`, `q` must have at least two elements, `fy` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each unique value in `q`, `q` is now a list of unique non-zero values from `q`, `cnt` is the frequency count of the last element in `q` as per `fy`, `i` is `len(q) - 2`**
