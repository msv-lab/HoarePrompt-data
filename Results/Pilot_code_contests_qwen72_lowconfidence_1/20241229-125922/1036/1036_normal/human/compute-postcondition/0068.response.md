Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` and `b` are the values returned by `func_5()`, `x` is a list of length `n + 5` where the first element is `a[0]` and subsequent elements are updated based on the loop, `p` is a list containing all non-zero values of `x[i]` for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `fx` contains the frequency count of each unique value in `p`, `y` is a list of length `m + 5` with the first element set to `b[0]` and the rest set to 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `b[2]` is not 0, `y[2]` is set to `b[0] + 2 * b[2]`, `q` is a list with the first element being `b[0] + b[2]` and the second element being `y[2]`, `fy` has the key `b[0] + b[2]` with its value incremented by 1, and if `fy.get(y[2], 0) == 0`, `fy[y[2]]` is set to 1; otherwise, `fy[b[0] + 2 * b[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `b[2]` is 0, `y[2]` remains 0, `q` and `fy` retain their initial states as described in the precondition, and `fy[0]` is incremented by 1.***
