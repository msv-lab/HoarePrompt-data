The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns the result of `x^y % p`. Specifically, the function calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. After the function executes, the returned value `res` is `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the original input values, and `p` remains unchanged. If `y` is 0, the function returns `1` because any number to the power of 0 is 1. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified parameter constraints and ensures that the result is always a non-negative integer less than `p`.
