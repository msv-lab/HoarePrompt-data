The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` contains the GCD, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles edge cases such as when one or both of the inputs are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero.
