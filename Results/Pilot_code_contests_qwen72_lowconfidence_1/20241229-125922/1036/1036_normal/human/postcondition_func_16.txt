The function `func_17` redirects the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. It does not process any data or perform any operations on the data read from `input.txt` or written to `output.txt`. The function assumes that both `input.txt` and `output.txt` exist and are accessible. If either file does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will raise an exception. After the function executes, `sys.stdin` will be set to read from `input.txt`, and `sys.stdout` will be set to write to `output.txt`. Any subsequent reads or writes using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` will use these redirected streams.
