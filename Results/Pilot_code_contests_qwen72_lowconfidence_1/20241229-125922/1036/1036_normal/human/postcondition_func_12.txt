The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraint `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the integer value representing the number of combinations of `n` items taken `r` at a time, using the formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `r` is 0 or `n`, returning 1 in both scenarios, as there is exactly one way to choose 0 items from `n` items or all `n` items from `n` items. However, the function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., `n` and `r` are non-negative integers and `r` does not exceed `n`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise exceptions or produce incorrect results.
