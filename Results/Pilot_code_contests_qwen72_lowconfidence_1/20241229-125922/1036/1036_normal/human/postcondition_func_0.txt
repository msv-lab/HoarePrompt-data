The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user via the `input()` function and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function completes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which can be captured and used by the calling context.
