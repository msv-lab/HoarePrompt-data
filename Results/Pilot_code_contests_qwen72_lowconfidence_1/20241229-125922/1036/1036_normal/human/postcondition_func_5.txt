`func_6` is a function that modifies the system's recursion limit and the stack size for threads. It then creates a new thread that runs a function named `main` and starts this thread. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the system's recursion limit is set to 100,000,000, the stack size for threads is set to 40,960,000 bytes, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to thread creation or system limits, which could lead to issues if the system cannot accommodate these changes.
