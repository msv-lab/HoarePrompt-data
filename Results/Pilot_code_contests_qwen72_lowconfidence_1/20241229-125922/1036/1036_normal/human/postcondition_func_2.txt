The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the input to be a string of space-separated integers. It then converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or an empty map object. The function does not handle any edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numbers, or invalid input formats. After the function executes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers, but it is not a list or tuple and should be converted if needed for further processing.
