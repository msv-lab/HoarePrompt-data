You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given an array a of length n and array b of length m both consisting of only integers 0 and 1. Consider a matrix c of size n × m formed by following rule: c_{i, j} = a_i ⋅ b_j (i.e. a_i multiplied by b_j). It's easy to see that c consists of only zeroes and ones too.

How many subrectangles of size (area) k consisting only of ones are there in c?

A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m) a subrectangle c[x_1 ... x_2][y_1 ... y_2] is an intersection of the rows x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, ..., x_2 and the columns y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, ..., y_2.

The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ⋅ m), length of array a, length of array b and required size of subrectangles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), elements of a.

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 1), elements of b.

Output

Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of c with size (area) k consisting only of ones.
