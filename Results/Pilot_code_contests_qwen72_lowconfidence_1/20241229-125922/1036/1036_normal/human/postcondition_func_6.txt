The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the second element of `item`, assuming that `item` has at least two elements and that the second element is of a type that supports comparison (e.g., int, float, str). If `item` does not have at least two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. If the second element is not of a type that supports comparison, the behavior is undefined but the function will still return that element.
