Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code in `func_18` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` from the user and the arrays `a` and `b` using `func_3` and `func_5`. These functions are designed to handle the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Cumulative Sums Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative sums of non-zero elements in arrays `a` and `b` and stores them in arrays `x` and `y`, respectively. This is done using nested loops and conditional checks to ensure that only non-zero elements are considered.

3. **Frequency Tracking**: The function uses dictionaries `fx` and `fy` to track the frequency of each cumulative sum in arrays `x` and `y`. This helps in efficiently counting the number of valid subrectangles.

4. **Subrectangle Counting**: The function iterates through the unique cumulative sums in `p` and `q` to count the number of valid subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones. It checks if the product of the cumulative sums from `a` and `b` equals `k` and updates the count accordingly.

5. **Output**: The final count of valid subrectangles is passed to `func_19` for printing.

The code handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem description. For instance:
- If `k` is 1, the function correctly counts the number of 1s in the matrix.
- If `k` is a product of two cumulative sums, the function correctly counts the number of valid subrectangles.

Given that the code follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the program is deemed correct.
