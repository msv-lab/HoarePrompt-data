You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length n and array b of length m both consisting of only integers 0 and 1. Consider a matrix c of size n × m formed by following rule: c_{i, j} = a_i ⋅ b_j (i.e. a_i multiplied by b_j). It's easy to see that c consists of only zeroes and ones too.

How many subrectangles of size (area) k consisting only of ones are there in c?

A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m) a subrectangle c[x_1 ... x_2][y_1 ... y_2] is an intersection of the rows x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, ..., x_2 and the columns y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, ..., y_2.

The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ⋅ m), length of array a, length of array b and required size of subrectangles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), elements of a.

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 1), elements of b.

Output

Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of c with size (area) k consisting only of ones.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user via the `input()` function and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function completes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which can be captured and used by the calling context.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the user input as a string. If the user does not provide any input and simply presses Enter, the function will return an empty string. Any input provided by the user, including spaces and special characters, will be returned as is.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the input to be a string of space-separated integers. It then converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or an empty map object. The function does not handle any edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numbers, or invalid input formats. After the function executes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers, but it is not a list or tuple and should be converted if needed for further processing.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and returns a map object where each split element is converted to a string. If the input is empty or contains no elements, the function will return an empty map object.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the output of `func_3` as a list. The content of the list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3`. If `func_3` returns an iterable, `func_5` will convert it into a list. If `func_3` returns a non-iterable, `func_5` will raise a TypeError. If `func_3` raises an exception, `func_5` will propagate that exception.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  `func_6` is a function that modifies the system's recursion limit and the stack size for threads. It then creates a new thread that runs a function named `main` and starts this thread. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the system's recursion limit is set to 100,000,000, the stack size for threads is set to 40,960,000 bytes, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to thread creation or system limits, which could lead to issues if the system cannot accommodate these changes.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the second element of `item`, assuming that `item` has at least two elements and that the second element is of a type that supports comparison (e.g., int, float, str). If `item` does not have at least two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. If the second element is not of a type that supports comparison, the behavior is undefined but the function will still return that element.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order based on the key obtained from the `getKey` function. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and works correctly to extract the sorting key from each element. If `getKey` raises an exception for any element in `l`, the function will also raise an exception. If `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not handle negative values for `n` or `m`, and passing such values would result in an empty list.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a non-zero power of 2; otherwise, it returns `False`. Specifically, it correctly identifies `x` as a power of 2 if `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 0 by returning `False`, as 0 is not a power of 2.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. The function does not handle negative integers, and passing a negative integer will result in an error.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents a digit from the original number `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `[0]`. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including large numbers.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraint `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the integer value representing the number of combinations of `n` items taken `r` at a time, using the formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `r` is 0 or `n`, returning 1 in both scenarios, as there is exactly one way to choose 0 items from `n` items or all `n` items from `n` items. However, the function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., `n` and `r` are non-negative integers and `r` does not exceed `n`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise exceptions or produce incorrect results.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns the result of `x^y % p`. Specifically, the function calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. After the function executes, the returned value `res` is `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the original input values, and `p` remains unchanged. If `y` is 0, the function returns `1` because any number to the power of 0 is 1. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified parameter constraints and ensures that the result is always a non-negative integer less than `p`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` contains the GCD, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles edge cases such as when one or both of the inputs are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` takes an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function handles the following cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all integers of the form 6k ± 1 (where k is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any such integer, it returns `False`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` redirects the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. It does not process any data or perform any operations on the data read from `input.txt` or written to `output.txt`. The function assumes that both `input.txt` and `output.txt` exist and are accessible. If either file does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will raise an exception. After the function executes, `sys.stdin` will be set to read from `input.txt`, and `sys.stdout` will be set to write to `output.txt`. Any subsequent reads or writes using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` will use these redirected streams.
Function number 18 :

 Output hints for function18:  The function `func_18` processes two lists `a` and `b` of binary values (0s and 1s) along with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It computes a result based on the cumulative sums of non-zero elements in `a` and `b`, and the frequency of these sums. The function ultimately calculates the number of valid pairs `(i, k // i)` where `i` is a non-zero cumulative sum from `a` and `k // i` is a non-zero cumulative sum from `b`, and both sums satisfy certain conditions. The final result, `ans`, is passed to another function `func_19`.

Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function19:  The function `func_19` prints the values in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' if they exist. After execution, the values in `args` are written to the stream, separated by the specified separator (or a space by default), followed by the specified end character (or a newline by default). If the 'flush' key in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, which results in only the end character being written to the stream, and the absence of certain keys in `kwargs`, which use their default values.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
