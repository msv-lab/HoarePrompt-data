Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_18` follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` and the arrays `a` and `b` using `func_3` and `func_5`.

2. **Cumulative Sums**: The function computes the cumulative sums of non-zero elements in `a` and `b` and stores them in arrays `x` and `y`, respectively. It also maintains dictionaries `fx` and `fy` to count the frequency of these cumulative sums.

3. **Valid Pairs Calculation**: The function iterates through the unique cumulative sums in `p` and `q` to find valid pairs `(i, k // i)` where `i` is a cumulative sum from `a` and `k // i` is a cumulative sum from `b`. It ensures that `i` divides `k` and both sums are non-zero.

4. **Result Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the number of valid subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones by multiplying the frequencies of the valid pairs and accumulates the result in `ans`.

5. **Output**: The final result `ans` is printed using `func_19`.

The code handles edge cases such as when `a` or `b` contain zeros, and it ensures that the cumulative sums are correctly computed and counted. The logic for finding valid pairs and calculating the result is sound and aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
