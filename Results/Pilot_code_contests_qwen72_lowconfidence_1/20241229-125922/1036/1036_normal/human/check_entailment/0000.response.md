Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subrectangles**: The program attempts to count subrectangles using a prefix sum approach but fails to correctly handle the formation of the matrix `c` and the counting of subrectangles of size `k` that consist only of ones.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums `x` and `y` are not correctly calculated to represent the cumulative sums of ones in arrays `a` and `b`. This leads to incorrect values being stored in `fx` and `fy`.

3. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**: The logic for updating `fx` and `fy` is flawed. The program incorrectly accumulates counts in `fx` and `fy` without properly considering the subrectangles of size `k`.

4. **Subrectangle Size Calculation**: The program does not correctly check if the product of the dimensions of a subrectangle equals `k`. It uses bitwise operations (`k & i`) which are not appropriate for this problem.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is larger than the possible area of the matrix `c` or where there are no subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3 3 2
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly form the matrix `c` and count the subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones. The prefix sum and accumulation logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
