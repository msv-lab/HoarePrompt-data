You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length n and array b of length m both consisting of only integers 0 and 1. Consider a matrix c of size n × m formed by following rule: c_{i, j} = a_i ⋅ b_j (i.e. a_i multiplied by b_j). It's easy to see that c consists of only zeroes and ones too.

How many subrectangles of size (area) k consisting only of ones are there in c?

A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m) a subrectangle c[x_1 ... x_2][y_1 ... y_2] is an intersection of the rows x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, ..., x_2 and the columns y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, ..., y_2.

The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ⋅ m), length of array a, length of array b and required size of subrectangles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), elements of a.

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 1), elements of b.

Output

Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of c with size (area) k consisting only of ones.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem described. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subrectangles**: The program attempts to count subrectangles using a prefix sum approach but fails to correctly handle the formation of the matrix `c` and the counting of subrectangles of size `k` that consist only of ones.

2. **Handling of Prefix Sums**: The prefix sums `x` and `y` are not correctly calculated to represent the cumulative sums of ones in arrays `a` and `b`. This leads to incorrect values being stored in `fx` and `fy`.

3. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**: The logic for updating `fx` and `fy` is flawed. The program incorrectly accumulates counts in `fx` and `fy` without properly considering the subrectangles of size `k`.

4. **Subrectangle Size Calculation**: The program does not correctly check if the product of the dimensions of a subrectangle equals `k`. It uses bitwise operations (`k & i`) which are not appropriate for this problem.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is larger than the possible area of the matrix `c` or where there are no subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3 3 2
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce an incorrect output because it does not correctly form the matrix `c` and count the subrectangles of size `k` consisting only of ones. The prefix sum and accumulation logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 19 : The function `func_19` prints the values in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' if they exist. After execution, the values in `args` are written to the stream, separated by the specified separator (or a space by default), followed by the specified end character (or a newline by default). If the 'flush' key in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, which results in only the end character being written to the stream, and the absence of certain keys in `kwargs`, which use their default values.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
