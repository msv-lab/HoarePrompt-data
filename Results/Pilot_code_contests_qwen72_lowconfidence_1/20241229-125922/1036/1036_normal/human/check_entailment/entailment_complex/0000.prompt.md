You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of length n and array b of length m both consisting of only integers 0 and 1. Consider a matrix c of size n × m formed by following rule: c_{i, j} = a_i ⋅ b_j (i.e. a_i multiplied by b_j). It's easy to see that c consists of only zeroes and ones too.

How many subrectangles of size (area) k consisting only of ones are there in c?

A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ y_2 ≤ m) a subrectangle c[x_1 ... x_2][y_1 ... y_2] is an intersection of the rows x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, ..., x_2 and the columns y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, ..., y_2.

The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ⋅ m), length of array a, length of array b and required size of subrectangles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), elements of a.

The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, …, b_m (0 ≤ b_i ≤ 1), elements of b.

Output

Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of c with size (area) k consisting only of ones.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description or the other functions are used in this function. This function is likely intended to read an integer input from the user, but does not align with the specific requirements of the problem described.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer value from the user via the `input()` function and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function completes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which can be captured and used by the calling context.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the problem description are used in the function signature of `func_2`. This function does not take any parameters and is not directly related to solving the problem described.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user input
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and returns the user input as a string. If the user does not provide any input and simply presses Enter, the function will return an empty string. Any input provided by the user, including spaces and special characters, will be returned as is.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from stdin, expecting at least one line of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the input line, which was expected to be space-separated integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the input to be a string of space-separated integers. It then converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error or an empty map object. The function does not handle any edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces, multiple spaces between numbers, or invalid input formats. After the function executes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers, but it is not a list or tuple and should be converted if needed for further processing.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem or have any preconditions. The function `func_4` does not take any parameters and its purpose is to read input from the user, which is not directly related to the main problem of finding subrectangles of size k consisting only of ones in the matrix c.
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and returns a map object where each split element is converted to a string. If the input is empty or contains no elements, the function will return an empty map object.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used; the function calls another function `func_3` and returns its output as a list.
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns the output of `func_3()` as a list. The content of the list depends on the implementation of `func_3()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the output of `func_3` as a list. The content of the list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3`. If `func_3` returns an iterable, `func_5` will convert it into a list. If `func_3` returns a non-iterable, `func_5` will raise a TypeError. If `func_3` raises an exception, `func_5` will propagate that exception.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, thus no preconditions apply to input variables.
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_6` is a function that modifies the system's recursion limit and the stack size for threads. It then creates a new thread that runs a function named `main` and starts this thread. The function itself does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function executes, the system's recursion limit is set to 100,000,000, the stack size for threads is set to 40,960,000 bytes, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to thread creation or system limits, which could lead to issues if the system cannot accommodate these changes.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list where the second element (item[1]) is of a type that supports comparison (e.g., int, float, str).
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
    #The program returns the second element of the tuple or list 'item', which is of a type that supports comparison (e.g., int, float, str).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the second element of `item`, assuming that `item` has at least two elements and that the second element is of a type that supports comparison (e.g., int, float, str). If `item` does not have at least two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. If the second element is not of a type that supports comparison, the behavior is undefined but the function will still return that element.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements that can be compared and sorted.
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a new list that is a sorted version of `l`, with elements sorted in descending order based on the key obtained from the `getKey` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `l` and returns a new list that is sorted in descending order based on the key obtained from the `getKey` function. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and works correctly to extract the sorting key from each element. If `getKey` raises an exception for any element in `l`, the function will also raise an exception. If `l` is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and num is an integer.
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a list of lists where each inner list contains `m` occurrences of the integer `num`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The function assumes that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `num` is an integer. If `n` or `m` is zero, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not handle negative values for `n` or `m`, and passing such values would result in an empty list.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns `True` if `x` is a non-zero power of 2, otherwise it returns `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a non-zero power of 2; otherwise, it returns `False`. Specifically, it correctly identifies `x` as a power of 2 if `x` is greater than 0 and has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. The function handles the edge case where `x` is 0 by returning `False`, as 0 is not a power of 2.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. If `n` is 0, the function returns '0'. The function does not handle negative integers, and passing a negative integer will result in an error.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the original non-negative integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents a digit from the original number `n`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `[0]`. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including large numbers.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))
    #The program returns the integer value representing the combination of n items taken r at a time, which is calculated as the factorial of n divided by the product of the factorial of r and the factorial of (n - r).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with the constraint `0 <= r <= n`. It calculates and returns the integer value representing the number of combinations of `n` items taken `r` at a time, using the formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `r` is 0 or `n`, returning 1 in both scenarios, as there is exactly one way to choose 0 items from `n` items or all `n` items from `n` items. However, the function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., `n` and `r` are non-negative integers and `r` does not exceed `n`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise exceptions or produce incorrect results.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer, y is a non-negative integer, and p is a positive integer.
def func_14(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is `x^y % p` where `x` and `y` are the original values, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for each bit position of `y`, and `p` remains a positive integer.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the result of `x^y % p` where `x` and `y` are the original values, and `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial value of `x` modulo `p` for each bit position of `y`, and `p` remains a positive integer. Given that `y` is 0, `res` simplifies to `1` since any number to the power of 0 is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` is an integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns the result of `x^y % p`. Specifically, the function calculates the modular exponentiation of `x` raised to the power of `y`, modulo `p`. After the function executes, the returned value `res` is `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the original input values, and `p` remains unchanged. If `y` is 0, the function returns `1` because any number to the power of 0 is 1. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified parameter constraints and ensures that the result is always a non-negative integer less than `p`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_15(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` contains the GCD, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles edge cases such as when one or both of the inputs are zero, returning the non-zero value or zero if both are zero.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_16(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, and `n` is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, greater than 3, not divisible by 2, 3, or any prime number up to the largest prime less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any such prime, the function returns False. `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` that is congruent to 5 modulo 6.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` takes an integer `n` greater than 1 and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. The function handles the following cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
- For `n` greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all integers of the form 6k ± 1 (where k is an integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any such integer, it returns `False`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and thus no preconditions can be defined for the input variables. However, it assumes that 'input.txt' and 'output.txt' files exist and are accessible for reading and writing, respectively.
def func_17():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` redirects the standard input (`sys.stdin`) to read from a file named `input.txt` and the standard output (`sys.stdout`) to write to a file named `output.txt`. It does not process any data or perform any operations on the data read from `input.txt` or written to `output.txt`. The function assumes that both `input.txt` and `output.txt` exist and are accessible. If either file does not exist or cannot be opened, the function will raise an exception. After the function executes, `sys.stdin` will be set to read from `input.txt`, and `sys.stdout` will be set to write to `output.txt`. Any subsequent reads or writes using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` will use these redirected streams.

#Function 18:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n * m. a is a list of n integers where each element is either 0 or 1. b is a list of m integers where each element is either 0 or 1.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 40000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n * m. `a` is a list of n integers where each element is either 0 or 1. `b` is a list of m integers where each element is either 0 or 1. If the loop did not execute, `ans` remains 0. If the loop executed, `ans` is the sum of the products of the frequency counts of valid pairs `(i, k // i)`, and the function `func_19` was called with `ans` as an argument.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` processes two lists `a` and `b` of binary values (0s and 1s) along with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It computes a result based on the cumulative sums of non-zero elements in `a` and `b`, and the frequency of these sums. The function ultimately calculates the number of valid pairs `(i, k // i)` where `i` is a non-zero cumulative sum from `a` and `k // i` is a non-zero cumulative sum from `b`, and both sums satisfy certain conditions. The final result, `ans`, is passed to another function `func_19`.

#Function 19:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args, 'file' is a stream object where the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_19():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not, `at_start` is False (if `args` is not empty), `str(args[0])` through `str(args[-1])` have been written to `file` separated by `sep` (if `args` contains more than one element). If `args` is empty, `at_start` remains True and nothing is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' but not 'end'. `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it existed or `' '` if it did not. `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it existed or `sys.stdout` if it did not. `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty. The value of `'end'` in `kwargs` or `'\n'` if `'end'` was not in `kwargs` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs` contained the key 'flush' and its value was `True`, then `kwargs` no longer contains the key 'flush' and the buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` prints the values in the `args` tuple to a specified stream (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), with options to customize the separator between values, the end character, and whether to flush the stream. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' if they exist. After execution, the values in `args` are written to the stream, separated by the specified separator (or a space by default), followed by the specified end character (or a newline by default). If the 'flush' key in `kwargs` is set to `True`, the stream is flushed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, which results in only the end character being written to the stream, and the absence of certain keys in `kwargs`, which use their default values.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
