Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly handle the problem of counting the number of subrectangles of size \( k \) consisting only of ones in the matrix \( c \).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cumulative Sums:**
   - The code calculates cumulative sums for arrays `a` and `b` and stores them in lists `x` and `y`. However, the cumulative sums are not correctly calculated. The cumulative sum for `a` and `b` should be reset to 0 whenever a 0 is encountered, but the code does not reset `x[i]` and `y[i]` to 0 correctly. This can lead to incorrect cumulative sums.

2. **Incorrect Frequency Counting:**
   - The code uses dictionaries `fx` and `fy` to store the frequency of cumulative sums. However, the way these frequencies are updated is incorrect. The code adds the cumulative frequency to each value in the dictionary, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect counts.

3. **Incorrect Pair Matching:**
   - The code attempts to match pairs `(i, k // i)` where `i` is a cumulative sum from `a` and `k // i` is a cumulative sum from `b`. However, the condition `if k & i != 0` is incorrect. It should check if `k % i == 0` to ensure that `i` is a divisor of `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases where `k` is 1 or where the entire matrix `c` consists of zeros. These edge cases should be handled explicitly to ensure the correct count of subrectangles.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:

Consider the input:
```
3 3 2
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

The expected output is 4, but the code will not produce the correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

The code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
