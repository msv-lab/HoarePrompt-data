### Analysis of the Program

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input:** 
  - Three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 40000 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \cdot m \).
  - Two arrays \( a \) of length \( n \) and \( b \) of length \( m \), both consisting of only integers 0 and 1.
- **Output:** 
  - The number of subrectangles of size \( k \) consisting only of ones in the matrix \( c \) where \( c_{i, j} = a_i \cdot b_j \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) using `func_3()`.
   - It reads the arrays \( a \) and \( b \) using `func_5()`.

2. **Preprocessing Arrays:**
   - It initializes two lists \( x \) and \( y \) to store cumulative sums of 1s in \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - It also initializes dictionaries \( fx \) and \( fy \) to store the frequency of these cumulative sums.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Sums:**
   - For array \( a \), it calculates the cumulative sum of 1s and updates the dictionary \( fx \) with the frequency of each sum.
   - Similarly, for array \( b \), it calculates the cumulative sum of 1s and updates the dictionary \( fy \).

4. **Counting Valid Subrectangles:**
   - It iterates over the unique cumulative sums in \( p \) (from \( a \)) and checks if \( k \) is divisible by the current sum.
   - If \( k \) is divisible by the current sum, it multiplies the frequency of the current sum in \( fx \) by the frequency of \( k \) divided by the current sum in \( fy \) and adds the result to the answer.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final answer using `func_19()`.

#### Correctness Check:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description.
- **Matrix Formation:**
  - The program implicitly forms the matrix \( c \) by calculating the cumulative sums of 1s in \( a \) and \( b \).
- **Subrectangle Counting:**
  - The program correctly identifies the subrectangles of size \( k \) consisting only of ones by leveraging the cumulative sums and their frequencies.
- **Output:**
  - The program outputs the correct number of subrectangles as required.

### Conclusion
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly reads the input, processes the arrays to form the matrix, counts the subrectangles of size \( k \) consisting only of ones, and outputs the result.

**Correctness: True**
