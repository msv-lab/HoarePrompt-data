Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input values `a` and `b` contain zeros, which can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the program incorrectly accumulates the counts of continuous ones in arrays `a` and `b`, which can lead to incorrect subrectangle counts.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 2
1 0 1
1 0 1
```
The matrix `c` formed would be:
```
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```
The program should output `2` because there are two subrectangles of size 2 consisting only of ones:
- The top-left 1x2 subrectangle.
- The bottom-left 1x2 subrectangle.

However, the program will incorrectly count more subrectangles due to the way it accumulates the counts of continuous ones in `a` and `b`.

This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the presence of zeros in the input arrays, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
