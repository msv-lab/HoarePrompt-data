The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `v` from the input, representing the number of servers, the number of direct connections, and the index of the server whose failure will disconnect the system, respectively. It then constructs a network of `n` servers with `m` connections in such a way that the network remains connected unless the server `v` fails. If it is impossible to construct such a network with the given `m` connections, the function prints `-1` and terminates. Otherwise, it prints the connections in the form of pairs of server indices. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the result to the console. The final state of the program is that the network configuration is printed, or `-1` is printed if the construction is not possible.
