Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the requirement that when the server with index `v` fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes impossible. Specifically, the program creates a chain of connections from server 1 to server `n`, and then adds additional connections to meet the required number `m`. However, this approach does not ensure that the removal of server `v` will disconnect the network.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 6 3
```
The program will produce the following output:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```
In this configuration, removing server 3 (which is `v`) does not disconnect the network because server 1 is still connected to server 4 through server 2. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement that the removal of server `v` should cause the network to become disconnected. Hence, the program is incorrect.
