Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the requirement that the system should become disconnected if the server with index `v` fails. Specifically, the code constructs a network where the removal of any single server (not just the server with index `v`) can potentially disconnect the network. This is because the code creates a linear chain of connections and then adds additional edges without ensuring that the removal of the server `v` specifically causes the disconnection.

For example, consider the input `5 6 3`. The expected output should ensure that removing server `3` will disconnect the network. However, the current implementation may produce a configuration like:

```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 4
2 5
```

In this configuration, removing server `3` does not disconnect the network because servers `1` and `2` can still communicate with servers `4` and `5` through the remaining connections. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements in every potential case.
