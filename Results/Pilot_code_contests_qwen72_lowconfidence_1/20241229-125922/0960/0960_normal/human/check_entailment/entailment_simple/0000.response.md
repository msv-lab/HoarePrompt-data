Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program attempts to solve the problem by creating a connected graph with \( n \) servers and \( m \) edges, ensuring that the removal of server \( v \) disconnects the graph. However, there are several issues that prevent the program from fully meeting the problem description:

1. **Initial Check for Connectivity**:
   - The program checks if \( m < n - 1 \) and prints \(-1\) if true. This is correct because a connected graph with \( n \) nodes requires at least \( n - 1 \) edges.
   - However, the program should also check if \( m \) is too large to form a valid graph. Specifically, the maximum number of edges in a graph with \( n \) nodes is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). If \( m \) exceeds this value, the program should print \(-1\).

2. **Edge Creation**:
   - The program creates a linear chain of edges to ensure connectivity: \((1, 2), (2, 3), \ldots, (n-1, n)\). This is correct.
   - It then adds additional edges to reach the required \( m \) edges. However, the way it adds these edges does not guarantee that the removal of server \( v \) will disconnect the graph. For example, if \( v = 1 \) and the program adds edges like \((2, 4), (2, 5), \ldots\), the graph might remain connected even after removing server 1.

3. **Server Index Translation**:
   - The program attempts to swap the indices of server 1 and server \( v \) to ensure that the removal of server \( v \) disconnects the graph. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the graph and how the edges are distributed. Swapping indices alone does not guarantee that the graph will become disconnected upon the removal of server \( v \).

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1**: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 6 \), \( v = 3 \)
  - The program correctly outputs a set of edges that form a connected graph and ensures that removing server 3 disconnects the graph.
- **Case 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( m = 100 \), \( v = 1 \)
  - The program incorrectly prints \(-1\) because it does not handle the case where \( m \) is too large. It should print \(-1\) if \( m \) exceeds the maximum possible number of edges, which is \( \frac{6(6-1)}{2} = 15 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where \( m \) is too large and does not guarantee that the removal of server \( v \) will disconnect the graph in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
