Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program attempts to solve the problem of connecting `n` servers with `m` direct connections in such a way that the system becomes disconnected when the server with index `v` fails. However, the program has a few issues that prevent it from meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Issues:

1. **Handling of `m < n - 1` Case:**
   - The program correctly checks if `m < n - 1` and prints `-1` if this condition is met. This is because a connected graph with `n` nodes requires at least `n - 1` edges. However, this check alone is not sufficient to ensure the program's correctness in all cases.

2. **Construction of the Initial Connected Graph:**
   - The program constructs an initial connected graph using a chain of edges: `edges = [(i, i + 1) for i in xrange(n - 1)]`. This ensures that the graph is initially connected. However, the next steps are problematic.

3. **Adding Additional Edges:**
   - The program then tries to add additional edges to reach the total of `m` edges. It does this by adding edges between non-adjacent nodes: `edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))`.
   - The issue here is that the program does not ensure that the addition of these edges maintains the property that the system becomes disconnected when server `v` fails. Specifically, the program does not consider the position of server `v` in the graph and how the additional edges affect the connectivity of the graph when `v` is removed.

4. **Reordering of Nodes:**
   - The program reorders the nodes to ensure that server `v` is placed in a specific position: `translate[v - 1], translate[1] = translate[1], translate[v - 1]`.
   - This reordering is intended to make sure that removing server `v` will disconnect the graph. However, the reordering is done after the edges are already added, which may not guarantee that the graph will become disconnected when `v` is removed.

#### Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 6 3
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 3
3 5
```
However, the program might produce a different set of edges that do not necessarily ensure the graph becomes disconnected when server `3` fails. For example, the program might produce:
```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1 4
2 5
```
In this case, removing server `3` does not disconnect the graph, as there are still paths between the remaining servers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always ensure that the graph becomes disconnected when the specified server `v` fails, which is a critical requirement of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
