Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of edges `m` is exactly `n-1`. In this scenario, the program will create a linear chain of connections, which means that removing any server (except the endpoints) will disconnect the network. However, the problem specifies that the removal of the server `v` should cause the disconnection, not just any server. 

For example, consider the input `5 4 3`:

- The program will create the following edges: `(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)`.
- Removing server `3` will indeed disconnect the network.
- However, removing server `2` or `4` will also disconnect the network, which is not the desired behavior according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that only the specified server `v` causes the network to become disconnected.
