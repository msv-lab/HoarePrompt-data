Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that the failure of server `v` should lead to the disconnection of the system. Specifically, the program constructs a network where the removal of server `v` does not necessarily disconnect the system. For example, consider the input `5 6 3`:

- The program constructs the following edges: `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 5)`.
- If server `3` fails, the remaining edges are `(1, 2)`, `(4, 5)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 5)`. However, the network remains connected through the edges `(1, 2)` and `(4, 5)`, and the system does not become disconnected.

To meet the problem description, the network should be constructed in such a way that the removal of server `v` causes the network to become disconnected. The current implementation does not ensure this property, making the program incorrect.
