Postcondition: ***`n` is unchanged, `m` is the original value of `m` minus the total number of edges added, `v` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ v â‰¤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]` plus additional tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each valid pair where `node1_nr` ranges from 1 to `n-1` and `node2_nr` ranges from `node1_nr + 2` to `n-1` while `m > 0`, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n` or greater. If `m` > 0, the program has terminated.***
