The code appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 4, so the tuple `(1, 4)` is added to `edges`.

The initial state of `edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`. After appending `(1, 4)`, the new state of `edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
