The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `v`. The initial state specifies the ranges for these variables, but the actual values will be determined by the input.

- `n`, `m`, and `v` are reassigned the values from the input.
- The input values will replace the initial state values, but they must still adhere to the constraints specified in the initial state (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n).

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `v` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and their values are now determined by the input.**
