The value of `m` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `m` is now greater than -1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` is now greater than -1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
