Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `v` from the input, representing the number of servers, the number of direct connections, and the index of the server whose failure will disconnect the system, respectively. It then constructs a network of `n` servers with `m` connections in such a way that the network remains connected unless the server `v` fails. If it is impossible to construct such a network with the given `m` connections, the function prints `-1` and terminates. Otherwise, it prints the connections in the form of pairs of server indices. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the result to the console. The final state of the program is that the network configuration is printed, or `-1` is printed if the construction is not possible. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `m < n - 1`, the function correctly identifies that it is impossible to form a connected network and prints `-1`.
- The function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges (`3 ≤ n ≤ 105`, `0 ≤ m ≤ 105`, `1 ≤ v ≤ n`). If these constraints are violated, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where `m` is exactly `n - 1` but the network cannot be made resilient to the failure of server `v` without additional connections. This could lead to incorrect configurations.
- The function does not validate the input to ensure that `n`, `m`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges, which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided.
