The code snippet creates a list `output` which consists of formatted strings representing the translated edges. Each string is formed by taking an edge `(n1, n2)` from the `edges` list and translating the nodes using the `translate` list.

Let's break down the changes:

1. **Edges Translation**: For each tuple `(n1, n2)` in `edges`, the corresponding values in `translate` are used to form the string `'%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2])`. This means that each edge `(n1, n2)` in `edges` is translated to `(translate[n1], translate[n2])`.

2. **Output List**: The `output` list is created and populated with these translated edge strings.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, `m`, `v`, `edges`, and `translate` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `output`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is unchanged.
- `m` is the original value of `m` minus the total number of edges added.
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]` plus additional tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each valid pair where `node1_nr` ranges from 1 to `n-1` and `node2_nr` ranges from `node1_nr + 2` to `n-1` while `m > 0`.
- `node1_nr` is `n`.
- `node2_nr` is `n` or greater.
- If `m` > 0, the program has terminated.
- `translate` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `translate[v - 1]` and `translate[1]` swapped.

After executing the code snippet:
- `output` is a list of strings where each string represents a translated edge from the `edges` list.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is the original value of `m` minus the total number of edges added, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]` plus additional tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each valid pair where `node1_nr` ranges from 1 to `n-1` and `node2_nr` ranges from `node1_nr + 2` to `n-1` while `m > 0`, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n` or greater, if `m` > 0, the program has terminated, `translate` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `translate[v - 1]` and `translate[1]` swapped, `output` is a list of strings where each string is `'%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2])` for each `(n1, n2)` in `edges`.**
