The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node2_nr` is 5, so after the increment, `node2_nr` becomes 6. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `node2_nr` is 6, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n), (3, 5)]`, `n` is greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
