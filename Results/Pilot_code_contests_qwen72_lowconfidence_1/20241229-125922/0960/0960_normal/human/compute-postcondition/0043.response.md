The code appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state:

- `m` is greater than 0
- `node2_nr` is 5
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`
- `n` must be greater than 5
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
- `node1_nr` is 3

The new tuple `(3, 5)` is appended to the `edges` list.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` is 5, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n), (3, 5)]`, `n` is greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
