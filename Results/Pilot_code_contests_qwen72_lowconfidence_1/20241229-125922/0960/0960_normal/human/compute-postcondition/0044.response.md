The value of `m` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since `m` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, `m` is now greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 0, `node2_nr` is 5, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n), (3, 5)]`, `n` is greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
