The value of `m` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since `m` was initially greater than `n - 1`, after decrementing, `m` is now greater than or equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
