To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

1. **Condition 1: `m > 0`**
   - The current state specifies that `m` must be greater than `n - 3`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 3` could be negative, zero, or positive depending on the value of `n`.
   - To ensure `m > 0`, `m` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the condition to `m` is greater than 0.

2. **Condition 2: `node2_nr < n`**
   - The current state specifies that `node2_nr` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, and `node2_nr` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute.

Combining these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
