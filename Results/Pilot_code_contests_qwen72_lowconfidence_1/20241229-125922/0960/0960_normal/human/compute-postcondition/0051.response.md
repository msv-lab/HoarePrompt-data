The code appends a new tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state:

- `m` is greater than 0
- `node2_nr` is 7
- `edges` is a list of tuples as specified
- `n` is greater than 5
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
- `node1_nr` is 3

After executing the code, the new tuple `(3, 7)` is added to the list `edges`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` is 7, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)]`, `n` is greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
