To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `while m > 0 and node1_nr < n`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `m` is 0 or a negative number.
   - `node2_nr` is `n`.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
   - `node1_nr` is 3.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - Currently, `m` is 0 or a negative number, which means `m > 0` is false.
   - To satisfy this condition, `m` must be a positive number. Therefore, `m` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

2. **Condition `node1_nr < n`:**
   - Currently, `node1_nr` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - For `node1_nr < n` to be true, `n` must be greater than 3. Since `n` is already greater than 1, this condition is already satisfied.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only adjustment needed is to change `m` from 0 or a negative number to a positive number.

### Final State:
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` is `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
