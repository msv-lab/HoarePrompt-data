The value of `node2_nr` is updated to `node1_nr + 2`. Given that `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` becomes 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than `n - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
