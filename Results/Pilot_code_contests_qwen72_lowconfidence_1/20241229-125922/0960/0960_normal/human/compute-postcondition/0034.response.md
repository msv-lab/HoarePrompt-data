To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `m > 0`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1 (`m` is now `m - 1`). For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 0 after this decrement. Therefore, `m` must have been at least 2 at the start of the previous iteration.

2. **Condition 2:** `node2_nr < n`
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node2_nr` is 6. For the loop to execute again, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. Since `node2_nr` is 6, `n` must be greater than 6.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that both `m` is greater than 0 and `node2_nr` is less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Adjusted States:
- **`m`**: Since `m` is now `m - 1` and must be greater than 0, `m` must have been at least 2 at the start of the previous iteration.
- **`n`**: Since `node2_nr` is 6 and must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 6.

The other variables (`v`, `edges`, `node1_nr`) do not directly affect the loop condition, so they remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 6, `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is now `m - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 6**
