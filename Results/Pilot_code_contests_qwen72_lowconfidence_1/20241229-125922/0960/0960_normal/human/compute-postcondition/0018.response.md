To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 4
- `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`
- `node1_nr` is 1
- `node2_nr` is 5

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - The current state indicates that `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`. Since `n` is greater than 4, `n - 2` is at least 2. Therefore, `m` is at least 2, which satisfies `m > 0`.

2. **Condition `node2_nr < n`:**
   - The current state indicates that `node2_nr` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 4, `n` could be 5, 6, 7, etc. For `node2_nr` to be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 5.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 5**: This ensures that `node2_nr` (which is 5) is less than `n`.

No other adjustments are necessary because:
- `m` is already greater than 0.
- `node1_nr` and `v` do not affect the loop condition.
- The `edges` list is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**
