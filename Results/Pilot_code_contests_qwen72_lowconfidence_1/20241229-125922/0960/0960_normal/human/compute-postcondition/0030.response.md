To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 4
- `m` is now greater than -1
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
- `edges` is a list of tuples as described
- `node1_nr` is 2
- `node2_nr` is 5

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - The current state indicates that `m` is greater than -1. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `m` must be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0.

2. **Condition `node2_nr < n`:**
   - The current state indicates that `node2_nr` is 5 and `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. Since `node2_nr` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5 to satisfy this condition.

### Adjusted States:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 5.

No other states need to be adjusted based on the given conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 5**
