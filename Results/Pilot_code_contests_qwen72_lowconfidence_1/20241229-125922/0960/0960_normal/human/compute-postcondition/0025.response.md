`node2_nr` is assigned the value `node1_nr + 2`. Given that `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` must be greater than `n - 3`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
