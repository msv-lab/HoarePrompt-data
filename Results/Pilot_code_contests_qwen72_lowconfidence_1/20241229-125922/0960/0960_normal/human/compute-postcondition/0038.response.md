To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is greater than `n - 3`
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`
- `node1_nr` is 2
- `node2_nr` is 4

### Loop Code:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))
    m -= 1
    node2_nr += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates when either `m` is no longer greater than 0 or `node2_nr` is no longer less than `n`.

2. **Behavior of Variables**:
   - Each iteration of the loop:
     - Appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to `edges`.
     - Decrements `m` by 1.
     - Increments `node2_nr` by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - **`m`**: The loop decrements `m` until it is no longer greater than 0. Therefore, after the loop, `m` will be 0 or a negative number.
   - **`node2_nr`**: The loop increments `node2_nr` until it is no longer less than `n`. Therefore, after the loop, `node2_nr` will be equal to `n`.
   - **`edges`**: The list `edges` will have additional tuples appended to it. Specifically, the number of new tuples added will be the minimum of `m` and `n - node2_nr` (initially 4).

### Final Output State:
- `m` is 0 or a negative number.
- `node2_nr` is `n`.
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- `node1_nr` remains 2.

### Output State:
**`m` is 0 or a negative number, `node2_nr` is `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 2.**
