The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is now `m - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 6**
