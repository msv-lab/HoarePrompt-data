`node2_nr` is updated to `node1_nr + 2`. Given that `node1_nr` is 3, `node2_nr` becomes 5. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` is 5, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
