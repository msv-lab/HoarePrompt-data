The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node2_nr` is 7, so after incrementing, `node2_nr` becomes 8. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `node2_nr` is 8, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)]`, `n` is greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
