The given code prints the contents of the `output` list, each element on a new line. The state of the program does not change due to this operation. All the variables retain their values as they were before the execution of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is the original value of `m` minus the total number of edges added, `v` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ v â‰¤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]` plus additional tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each valid pair where `node1_nr` ranges from 1 to `n-1` and `node2_nr` ranges from `node1_nr + 2` to `n-1` while `m > 0`, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n` or greater, if `m` > 0, the program has terminated, `translate` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `translate[v - 1]` and `translate[1]` swapped, `output` is a list of strings where each string is `'%d %d' % (translate[n1], translate[n2])` for each `(n1, n2)` in `edges`.**
