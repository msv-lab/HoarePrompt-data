The code snippet appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, `node1_nr` is 1 and `node2_nr` is 3, so the tuple `(1, 3)` is appended to `edges`.

The initial value of `edges` is `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`. This means `edges` initially contains tuples from `(0, 1)` to `(n-2, n-1)`.

After appending `(1, 3)` to `edges`, the new value of `edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `v`, `node1_nr`, and `node2_nr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than `n - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 3**
