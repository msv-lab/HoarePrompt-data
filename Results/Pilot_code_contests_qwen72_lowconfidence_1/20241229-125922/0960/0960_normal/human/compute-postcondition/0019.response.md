The code appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given the initial state, the new tuple `(1, 5)` is added to the list `edges`.

- `n` remains greater than 5.
- `m` remains greater than or equal to `n - 2`.
- `v` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- `edges` now includes the new tuple, making the list `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`.
- `node1_nr` remains 1.
- `node2_nr` remains 5.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**.
