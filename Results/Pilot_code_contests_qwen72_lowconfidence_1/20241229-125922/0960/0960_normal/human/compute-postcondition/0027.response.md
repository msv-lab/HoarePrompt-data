The code appends the tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given that `node1_nr` is 2 and `node2_nr` is 4, the tuple `(2, 4)` is added to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` must be greater than 0, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 4**
