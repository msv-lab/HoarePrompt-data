The code snippet `m = m - len(edges)` modifies the value of `m` by subtracting the length of the `edges` list from its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n`, `m`, and `v` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- If `m` < `n - 1`, `-1` has been printed and the program has terminated.
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`.

The length of `edges` is `n - 1` because it contains tuples from `0` to `n - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `m` is `m - (n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n`, `m` is `m - (n - 1)`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`**
