The function `func` should accept three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of servers, with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ 105.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of direct connections, with the constraint 0 ≤ m ≤ 105.
- `v` is an integer representing the index of the server whose failure will disconnect the system, with the constraint 1 ≤ v ≤ n.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the failure of the server indexed by `v` would cause the system to become disconnected.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`, representing the number of servers, the number of direct connections, and the index of the server whose failure will disconnect the system, respectively. It returns `True` if the failure of the server indexed by `v` would cause the system to become disconnected, and `False` otherwise.**
