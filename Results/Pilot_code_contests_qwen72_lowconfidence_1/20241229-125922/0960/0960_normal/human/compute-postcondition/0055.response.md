The value of `node1_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the original value of `m` minus the number of times the loop executed, `node2_nr` is the original value of `node2_nr` plus the number of times the loop executed, `edges` contains the original edges plus new tuples `(3, node2_nr)` for each iteration where `node2_nr` starts at 5 and increments by 1 for each iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `node2_nr`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 4.
