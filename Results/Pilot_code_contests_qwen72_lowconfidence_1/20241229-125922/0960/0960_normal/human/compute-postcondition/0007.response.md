The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `node1_nr`. This assignment does not affect the other variables, so their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects this update.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - (n - 1)`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`, `node1_nr` is 1**
