The `exit()` function call terminates the program execution immediately. As a result, no further changes occur to the variables `n`, `m`, or `v`. The program stops executing, and any subsequent code will not run.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `v` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and `m` is less than `n - 1`. `-1` has been printed. The program has terminated.**
