The code snippet `print(-1)` outputs `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `v`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `v` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 105, 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and their values are now determined by the input. Additionally, the current value of `m` is less than `n - 1`. `-1` has been printed.**
