The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `node2_nr` is 4, so after the increment, `node2_nr` becomes 5. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`, `edges`, `node1_nr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 5**
