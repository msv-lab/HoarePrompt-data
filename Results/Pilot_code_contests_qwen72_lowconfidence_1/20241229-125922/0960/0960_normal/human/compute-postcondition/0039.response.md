The value of `node1_nr` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `node1_nr` was 2, so the new value of `node1_nr` is 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 0 or a negative number, `node2_nr` is `n`, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`, `n` is greater than 1, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3.**
