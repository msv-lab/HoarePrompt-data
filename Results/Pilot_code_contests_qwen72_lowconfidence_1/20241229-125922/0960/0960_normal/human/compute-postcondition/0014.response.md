To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the conditions of the `while` loop: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

1. **Condition `m > 0`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `n - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, `m` is at least 2, which means `m > 0` is true.

2. **Condition `node2_nr < n`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `node2_nr` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 3, `n` could be 4 or more. However, since `node2_nr` is already 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for this condition to be true.

Since both conditions need to be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4. The other states (`m`, `v`, `edges`, `node1_nr`) do not need adjustment as they already satisfy their respective conditions.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 4**
