The code appends a tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` to the list `edges`. Given that `node1_nr` is 2 and `node2_nr` is 5, the tuple `(2, 5)` is added to `edges`.

The updated `edges` list will include all the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(2, 5)`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `v`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than 0, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m+1, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is 5**
