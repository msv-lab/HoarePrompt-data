The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. This means no further code will execute after this point, and the program will end. Since this function does not change any variables or program state, the values of `n`, `m`, `v`, and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `m` is the original value of `m` minus the total number of edges added, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]` plus additional tuples `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` for each valid pair where `node1_nr` ranges from 1 to `n-1` and `node2_nr` ranges from `node1_nr + 2` to `n-1` while `m > 0`, `node1_nr` is `n`, `node2_nr` is `n` or greater, the current value of `m` is greater than 0, and the program has terminated.**
