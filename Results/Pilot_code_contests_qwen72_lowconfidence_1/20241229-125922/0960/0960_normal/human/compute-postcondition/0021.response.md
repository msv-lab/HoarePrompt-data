The value of `node2_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5, `m` is greater than or equal to `n - 3`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is 6**
