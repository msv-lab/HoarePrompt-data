To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.

1. **Condition 1: `m > 0`**
   - According to the given state, `m` is already greater than 0. This condition is satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `node2_nr < n`**
   - The given state specifies that `node2_nr` is 5 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute, `node2_nr` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 5 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5.

Since `m` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for `m`. However, `n` must be greater than 5 to satisfy the second condition.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `node2_nr` is 5, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), ..., (2, n)]`, `n` must be greater than 5, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `node1_nr` is 3**
