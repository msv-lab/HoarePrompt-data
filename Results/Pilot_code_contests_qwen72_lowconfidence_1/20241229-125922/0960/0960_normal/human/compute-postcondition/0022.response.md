To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change with each iteration and what conditions must hold for the loop to execute multiple times. Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is greater than `n - 1`.
- `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples `[(i, i + 1) for i in range(n - 1)]`.
- `node1_nr` is 1.
- `node2_nr` is 3.

### Loop Code:
```python
while m > 0 and node2_nr < n:
    edges.append((node1_nr, node2_nr))
    m -= 1
    node2_nr += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
- In each iteration:
  - A tuple `(node1_nr, node2_nr)` is appended to `edges`.
  - `m` is decremented by 1.
  - `node2_nr` is incremented by 1.

### Iteration Breakdown:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - Condition: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
   - `edges` becomes `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3)]`.
   - `m` is decremented to `m - 1`.
   - `node2_nr` is incremented to `4`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - Condition: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
   - `edges` becomes `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`.
   - `m` is decremented to `m - 2`.
   - `node2_nr` is incremented to `5`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - Condition: `m > 0` and `node2_nr < n`.
   - `edges` becomes `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`.
   - `m` is decremented to `m - 3`.
   - `node2_nr` is incremented to `6`.

### General Pattern:
- After `k` iterations:
  - `edges` will contain `k` additional tuples: `[(1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, 2 + k)]`.
  - `m` will be `m - k`.
  - `node2_nr` will be `3 + k`.

### Final State:
- The loop will stop when either `m <= 0` or `node2_nr >= n`.
- Since `node2_nr` starts at 3 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will reach `n` after `n - 3` iterations.
- Therefore, the loop will execute `min(m, n - 3)` times.

### Output State:
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `m` is reduced by the number of iterations, which is `min(m, n - 3)`.
- `v` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n.
- `edges` will contain the original list plus `min(m, n - 3)` additional tuples: `[(1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`.
- `node1_nr` remains 1.
- `node2_nr` will be `min(m, n - 3) + 3`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is `max(0, m - (n - 3))`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`, `node1_nr` is 1, `node2_nr` is `min(m, n - 3) + 3`**
