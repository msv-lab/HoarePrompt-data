`node1_nr` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is `max(0, m - (n - 3))`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is `min(m, n - 3) + 3`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is `max(0, m - (n - 3))`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `edges` is a list of tuples `[(0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n-2, n-1), (1, 3), (1, 4), ..., (1, min(m, n - 3) + 2)]`, `node1_nr` is 2, `node2_nr` is `min(m, n - 3) + 3`.**
