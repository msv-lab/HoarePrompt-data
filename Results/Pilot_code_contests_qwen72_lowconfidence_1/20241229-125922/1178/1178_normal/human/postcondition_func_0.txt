The function `func_1` reads lines from `sys.stdin`, expecting a structure where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. It returns a list containing all lines read from `sys.stdin`, including the first line with the integer. If `sys.stdin` is empty, it returns an empty list. If `sys.stdin` contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, the returned list will still contain all available lines, but it will not enforce the expected number of lines.
