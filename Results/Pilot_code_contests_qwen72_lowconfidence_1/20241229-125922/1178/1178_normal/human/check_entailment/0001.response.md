Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly following the problem description:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_1` reads all input lines into a list but does not handle the first line which contains the integer `n`. This means the program does not know how many words to process.

2. **Handling Short Words**: The function `func_2` only handles words that are too long (more than 10 characters). It does not handle words that are 10 characters or less, which should remain unchanged.

3. **Output**: The program does not print the results. It only processes the words but does not output them as required by the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    args = []
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of words
    for _ in range(n):
        args.append(input().strip())  # Read each word and strip any trailing newline
    return args

def func_2(word):
    if len(word) > 10:
        n = len(word) - 2
        return word[0] + str(n) + word[-1]
    else:
        return word

def main():
    words = func_1()
    for word in words:
        print(func_2(word))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version reads the number of words, processes each word correctly, and prints the results as required.
