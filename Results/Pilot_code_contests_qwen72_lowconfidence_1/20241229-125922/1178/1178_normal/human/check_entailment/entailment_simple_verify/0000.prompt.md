You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

Output

Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.

Examples

Input

Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
    return args

#Function 2:
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling Input**: The `func_1` function reads all input lines, including the first line which specifies the number of words. However, this function does not handle the conversion of the first line to an integer to determine how many words to process. This means the program will not correctly process the input as specified.

2. **Processing Words**: The `func_2` function is intended to abbreviate words, but it does not check if the word length is greater than 10 before applying the abbreviation. According to the problem description, only words longer than 10 characters should be abbreviated.

3. **Output Handling**: The program does not include any logic to print the results as required by the problem description. It only defines functions but does not call them or handle the output.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line.strip())
    return args

def func_2(word):
    if len(word) > 10:
        n = len(word) - 2
        return word[0] + str(n) + word[-1]
    return word

def main():
    input_data = func_1()
    n = int(input_data[0])
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(func_2(input_data[i]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` strips the newline characters from the input lines.
- `func_2` checks if the word length is greater than 10 before abbreviating it.
- `main` reads the first line to determine the number of words, processes each word using `func_2`, and prints the results.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

argLines = func_1()
n = int(argLines[0])
argLines.pop(0)
for word in argLines:
    w = word.replace('\n', '')
    if len(w) > 10:
        print(func_2(w))
    else:
        print(w)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are directly used in the function signature. However, the function reads from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of lines where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word.
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdin` must contain at least the number of lines specified by the first line (which indicates the number of subsequent lines). If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.
    return args
    #The program returns `args`, which is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`. If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters.
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]
    #The program returns a string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of `n` (which is the length of `word` minus 2), and then the character at the index `n + 1` of `word`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
