You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

Output

Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.

Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
    return args

#Function 2:
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling Input**: The `func_1` function reads all input lines, including the first line which specifies the number of words. However, this function does not handle the conversion of the first line to an integer to determine how many words to process. This means the program will not correctly process the input as specified.

2. **Processing Words**: The `func_2` function is intended to abbreviate words, but it does not check if the word length is greater than 10 before applying the abbreviation. According to the problem description, only words longer than 10 characters should be abbreviated.

3. **Output Handling**: The program does not include any logic to print the results as required by the problem description. It only defines functions but does not call them or handle the output.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line.strip())
    return args

def func_2(word):
    if len(word) > 10:
        n = len(word) - 2
        return word[0] + str(n) + word[-1]
    return word

def main():
    input_data = func_1()
    n = int(input_data[0])
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(func_2(input_data[i]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` strips the newline characters from the input lines.
- `func_2` checks if the word length is greater than 10 before abbreviating it.
- `main` reads the first line to determine the number of words, processes each word using `func_2`, and prints the results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `word` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters. It returns a new string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of the length of `word` minus 2, and then the last character of `word`. If the input string `word` is less than 3 characters long, the function will raise an `IndexError` due to invalid indexing.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
