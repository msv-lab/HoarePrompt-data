Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not handle the case when the input string is exactly 2 characters long. According to the problem description, words that are not too long (i.e., 10 characters or less) should not be changed. However, the function `func_2` expects the input string to be at least 3 characters long, and if the input string is exactly 2 characters long, it will raise an `IndexError`.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
ab
```

The program will call `func_2("ab")`, and inside `func_2`, the line `return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]` will attempt to access `word[1 + 1]`, which is out of bounds for a 2-character string. This will result in an `IndexError`.

Therefore, the program does not handle this edge case correctly, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
