You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

Output

Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.

Examples

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

argLines = func_1()
n = int(argLines[0])
argLines.pop(0)
for word in argLines:
    w = word.replace('\n', '')
    if len(w) > 10:
        print(func_2(w))
    else:
        print(w)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are directly used in the function signature. However, the function reads from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of lines where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word.
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdin` must contain at least the number of lines specified by the first line (which indicates the number of subsequent lines). If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.
    return args
    #The program returns `args`, which is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`. If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters.
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]
    #The program returns a string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of `n` (which is the length of `word` minus 2), and then the character at the index `n + 1` of `word`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
