Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Handling Input**: The `func_1` function reads all input lines, including the first line which specifies the number of words. However, this function does not handle the conversion of the first line to an integer to determine how many words to process. This means the program will not correctly process the input as specified.

2. **Processing Words**: The `func_2` function is intended to abbreviate words, but it does not check if the word length is greater than 10 before applying the abbreviation. According to the problem description, only words longer than 10 characters should be abbreviated.

3. **Output Handling**: The program does not include any logic to print the results as required by the problem description. It only defines functions but does not call them or handle the output.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line.strip())
    return args

def func_2(word):
    if len(word) > 10:
        n = len(word) - 2
        return word[0] + str(n) + word[-1]
    return word

def main():
    input_data = func_1()
    n = int(input_data[0])
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(func_2(input_data[i]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` strips the newline characters from the input lines.
- `func_2` checks if the word length is greater than 10 before abbreviating it.
- `main` reads the first line to determine the number of words, processes each word using `func_2`, and prints the results.
