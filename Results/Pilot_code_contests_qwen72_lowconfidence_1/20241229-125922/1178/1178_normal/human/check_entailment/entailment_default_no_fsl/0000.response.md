Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a word has exactly 10 characters. According to the problem description, only words longer than 10 characters should be abbreviated. However, the current implementation uses `if len(w) > 10:` which means a word with exactly 10 characters will not be abbreviated, even though it should not be abbreviated according to the problem statement. This discrepancy makes the program incorrect. 

For example, if the input includes a word like "abcdefghij" (which is exactly 10 characters long), the program will incorrectly abbreviate it, whereas it should remain unchanged.
