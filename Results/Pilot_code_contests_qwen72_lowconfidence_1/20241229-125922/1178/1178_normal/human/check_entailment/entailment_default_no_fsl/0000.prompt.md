You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.

Output

Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.

Examples

Functions with output description for each function:
import sys

argLines = func_1()
n = int(argLines[0])
argLines.pop(0)
for word in argLines:
    w = word.replace('\n', '')
    if len(w) > 10:
        print(func_2(w))
    else:
        print(w)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
    return args
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads lines from `sys.stdin`, expecting a structure where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. It returns a list containing all lines read from `sys.stdin`, including the first line with the integer. If `sys.stdin` is empty, it returns an empty list. If `sys.stdin` contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, the returned list will still contain all available lines, but it will not enforce the expected number of lines.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a string `word` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters. It returns a new string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of the length of `word` minus 2, and then the last character of `word`. If the input string `word` is less than 3 characters long, the function will raise an `IndexError` due to invalid indexing.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
