#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are directly used in the function signature. However, the function reads from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of lines where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word.
def func_1():
    args = []
    for line in sys.stdin:
        args.append(line)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdin` must contain at least the number of lines specified by the first line (which indicates the number of subsequent lines). If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.
    return args
    #The program returns `args`, which is a list containing all lines from `sys.stdin`. If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads lines from `sys.stdin`, expecting a structure where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. It returns a list containing all lines read from `sys.stdin`, including the first line with the integer. If `sys.stdin` is empty, it returns an empty list. If `sys.stdin` contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, the returned list will still contain all available lines, but it will not enforce the expected number of lines.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: word is a string of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters.
def func_2(word):
    n = len(word) - 2
    return word[0] + str(n) + word[n + 1]
    #The program returns a string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of `n` (which is the length of `word` minus 2), and then the character at the index `n + 1` of `word`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `word` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a length of at least 3 characters. It returns a new string composed of the first character of `word`, followed by the string representation of the length of `word` minus 2, and then the last character of `word`. If the input string `word` is less than 3 characters long, the function will raise an `IndexError` due to invalid indexing.
