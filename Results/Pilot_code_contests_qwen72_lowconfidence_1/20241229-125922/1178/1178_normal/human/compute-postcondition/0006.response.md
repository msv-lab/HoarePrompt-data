The code appends the third line from `sys.stdin` to the list `args`. Since `args` initially contains the first and second lines from `sys.stdin`, after executing the code, `args` will contain the first, second, and third lines from `sys.stdin`.

Output State: **`args` is a list containing the first, second, and third lines from `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdin` must contain at least three lines**
