The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads from `sys.stdin`, expecting the first line to be an integer that indicates the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. The function returns `args`, which is a list containing all lines read from `sys.stdin`. If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, `args` will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, `args` will be an empty list.
Functionality: **The function reads from `sys.stdin`, expecting a structure where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. It returns a list containing all lines read. If `sys.stdin` is empty or contains fewer lines than specified, the returned list will contain whatever lines were available. If `sys.stdin` is empty, an empty list is returned.**
