The value of `line` (the second line from `sys.stdin`) is appended to the list `args`. The initial state specifies that `args` contains the first line from `sys.stdin`, and now it includes an additional element, which is the second line from `sys.stdin`.

Output State: **`args` is a list containing the first and second lines from `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdin` must contain at least two lines**
