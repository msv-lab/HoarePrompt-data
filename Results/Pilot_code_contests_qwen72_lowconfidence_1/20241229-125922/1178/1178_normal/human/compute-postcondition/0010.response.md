Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads lines from `sys.stdin`, expecting a structure where the first line is an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word. It returns a list containing all lines read from `sys.stdin`, including the first line with the integer. If `sys.stdin` is empty, it returns an empty list. If `sys.stdin` contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, the returned list will still contain all available lines, but it will not enforce the expected number of lines. **

### Explanation:
- **Input:** The function reads from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of lines. The first line should be an integer indicating the number of subsequent lines, each containing a single word.
- **Output:** The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a line read from `sys.stdin`.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `sys.stdin` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
  - If `sys.stdin` contains fewer lines than specified by the first line, the function still returns a list with all available lines, but it does not raise an error or enforce the expected number of lines.
  - The function includes the first line (the integer) in the returned list, which may not be what the user expects if they only want the subsequent lines.
- **Missing Logic:**
  - The function does not validate the first line to ensure it is an integer or handle cases where the first line is not a valid integer.
  - The function does not enforce the expected number of lines based on the integer in the first line.
