#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the string `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state remains unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `sys.stderr`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `s` is not a string (e.g., an integer or None), which would result in a `TypeError` being raised due to the format string expecting a string. Additionally, if `s` contains special characters, they will be written as-is to the standard error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle this exception, so the caller must ensure that the input is a valid integer. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value, assuming the user provided a valid integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string obtained by calling `inp().split()`. Each element in the input string, separated by spaces, is converted to an integer and added to the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the input using the `inp()` function (assuming `inp()` is a valid function that reads input), splits the string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input string contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError`. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.
