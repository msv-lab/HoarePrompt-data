The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the string `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state remains unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `sys.stderr`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `s` is not a string (e.g., an integer or None), which would result in a `TypeError` being raised due to the format string expecting a string. Additionally, if `s` contains special characters, they will be written as-is to the standard error.
