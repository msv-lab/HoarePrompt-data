Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2()` reads an integer `N` representing the number of boxes.
   - `func_3()` reads a list of integers `A` representing the required parity (0 or 1) for each box.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The code initializes an array `out` of size `N` with all zeros, representing whether a ball is placed in each box (0 for no ball, 1 for a ball).
   - It iterates over the boxes from the last to the first (i.e., from `N-1` to `0`).
   - For each box `i`, it calculates the sum `S` of the current values in the boxes that are multiples of `i+1`.
   - If the sum `S` modulo 2 does not match the required parity `A[i]`, it places a ball in the box `i` and updates the list `B` with the index `j` (which is `i + 1`).

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints the length of the list `B`, which represents the number of boxes that contain a ball.
   - If `B` is not empty, it prints the indices of the boxes that contain a ball.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no boxes contain a ball (i.e., when the output is `0`).
   - The code correctly handles the case where all `a_i` are 0, resulting in no balls being placed in any boxes.
   - The code correctly handles the case where the input `a_i` is a mix of 0s and 1s, ensuring that the final configuration of balls satisfies the given parities.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(N \log N)\) due to the nested loops, which is efficient enough for the given constraint \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code:
     - For input `3\n1 0 0`, the output is `1\n1`.
     - For input `5\n0 0 0 0 0`, the output is `0`.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **True**.
