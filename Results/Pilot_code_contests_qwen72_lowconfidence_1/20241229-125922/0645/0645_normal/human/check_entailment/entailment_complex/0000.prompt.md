You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Annotated Functions:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the string `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state remains unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `sys.stderr`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `s` is not a string (e.g., an integer or None), which would result in a `TypeError` being raised due to the format string expecting a string. Additionally, if `s` contains special characters, they will be written as-is to the standard error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle this exception, so the caller must ensure that the input is a valid integer. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value, assuming the user provided a valid integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string obtained by calling `inp().split()`. Each element in the input string, separated by spaces, is converted to an integer and added to the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the input using the `inp()` function (assuming `inp()` is a valid function that reads input), splits the string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input string contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError`. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
