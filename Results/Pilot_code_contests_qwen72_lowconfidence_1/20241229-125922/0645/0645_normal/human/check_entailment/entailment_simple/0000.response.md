Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Calls and Variable Names**:
   - The program uses `func_2()` and `func_3()` to read input, but these functions are not defined in the context provided. The correct way to read input in Python 3 is to use `input()` instead of `raw_input`, which is used in Python 2.
   - The variable `N` should be assigned using `N = int(input())` and the list `A` should be assigned using `A = list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The logic for determining the placement of balls in the boxes is flawed. The program iterates over the boxes in reverse order and tries to adjust the number of balls based on the current state of the boxes. However, the inner loop that calculates the sum of balls in multiples of the current box index is incorrect.
   - Specifically, the line `for k in range(i, N, j):` should be `for k in range(j, N + 1, j):` because the indices in `A` and `out` are 0-based, but the box numbers are 1-based. This means that `j` should start from `i + 1` and increment by `i + 1` to correctly check the multiples of the box number.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the number of boxes that will contain a ball and then the list of those boxes. However, if no good set of choices exists, it does not print `-1`, which is required by the problem statement.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
N = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
out = [0] * N
B = []

for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = sum(out[k - 1] for k in range(j, N + 1, j))
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)

print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))
else:
    print(-1)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading**: The program reads `N` and the list `A` correctly using `input()` and `map(int, input().split())`.
- **Logic for Ball Placement**: The program iterates over the boxes in reverse order. For each box, it calculates the sum of balls in the multiples of the current box number (using 1-based indexing). If the sum modulo 2 does not match the corresponding value in `A`, it places a ball in the current box and records the box number.
- **Output**: The program prints the number of boxes that will contain a ball and the list of those boxes. If no good set of choices exists, it prints `-1`.

This corrected program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.
