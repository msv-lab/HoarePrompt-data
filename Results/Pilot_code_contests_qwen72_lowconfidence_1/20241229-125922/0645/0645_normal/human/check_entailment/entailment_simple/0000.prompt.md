You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Examples

Input

3
1 0 0


Output

1
1


Input

5
0 0 0 0 0


Output

0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string obtained by calling `inp().split()`. Each element in the input string, separated by spaces, is converted to an integer and added to the list.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
