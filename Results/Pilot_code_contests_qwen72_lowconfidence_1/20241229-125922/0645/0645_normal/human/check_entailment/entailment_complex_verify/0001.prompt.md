You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Examples

Input

1 0 0


Output

Input

Output

Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(inp())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippet only defines some helper functions and does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not read the input, process it according to the problem description, or produce any output. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any potential case. Specifically, it lacks the core logic to determine if a good set of choices exists and to output the result accordingly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from collections import *
import sys

inp = raw_input
N = func_2()
A = func_3()
out = [0] * N
fail = False
B = []
for i in range(N - 1, -1, -1):
    j = i + 1
    S = 0
    for k in range(i, N, j):
        S += out[k]
    if S % 2 != A[i]:
        out[i] = 1
        B.append(j)
print(len(B))
if len(B):
    print(' '.join(map(str, B)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. It writes the string `s` followed by a newline character to the standard error stream (`sys.stderr`). The function does not return any value. After the function completes its execution, the string `s` will have been written to the standard error, and the program state remains unchanged except for the side effect of the output to `sys.stderr`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `s` is not a string (e.g., an integer or None), which would result in a `TypeError` being raised due to the format string expecting a string. Additionally, if `s` contains special characters, they will be written as-is to the standard error.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_2():
    return int(inp())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function does not handle this exception, so the caller must ensure that the input is a valid integer. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer value, assuming the user provided a valid integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function.
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string obtained by calling `inp().split()`. Each element in the input string, separated by spaces, is converted to an integer and added to the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the input using the `inp()` function (assuming `inp()` is a valid function that reads input), splits the string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input string contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError`. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
