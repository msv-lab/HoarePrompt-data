Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet does not implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. It only defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that do not solve the problem at hand. Specifically, the code lacks the main logic to determine whether a good set of choices exists and to output the appropriate result. Therefore, this code is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.
