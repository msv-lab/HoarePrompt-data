Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code only defines helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) and does not implement the core logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires reading the input, processing it to determine if a good set of choices exists, and producing the appropriate output. The provided code lacks this core logic entirely. The output hints confirm that while `func_3` correctly reads and processes a list of integers from the input, this alone is insufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
