You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N empty boxes arranged in a row from left to right. The integer i is written on the i-th box from the left (1 \leq i \leq N).

For each of these boxes, Snuke can choose either to put a ball in it or to put nothing in it.

We say a set of choices to put a ball or not in the boxes is good when the following condition is satisfied:

* For every integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), the total number of balls contained in the boxes with multiples of i written on them is congruent to a_i modulo 2.



Does there exist a good set of choices? If the answer is yes, find one good set of choices.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* a_i is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

If a good set of choices does not exist, print `-1`.

If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format:


M
b_1 b_2 ... b_M


where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order.

Program:
```
from collections import *
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    sys.stderr.write('{}\n'.format(s))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(inp())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return [int(_) for _ in inp().split()]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet does not implement the required functionality described in the problem statement. It only defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) that do not solve the problem at hand. Specifically, the code lacks the main logic to determine whether a good set of choices exists and to output the appropriate result. Therefore, this code is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the input using the `inp()` function (assuming `inp()` is a valid function that reads input), splits the string by whitespace, converts each resulting substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input string contains non-integer values, this will result in a `ValueError`. If the input string is empty, the function will return an empty list.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
