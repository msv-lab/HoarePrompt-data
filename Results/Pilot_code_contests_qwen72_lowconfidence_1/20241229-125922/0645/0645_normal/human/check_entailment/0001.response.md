Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippet only defines some helper functions and does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not read the input, process it according to the problem description, or produce any output. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for any potential case. Specifically, it lacks the core logic to determine if a good set of choices exists and to output the result accordingly.
