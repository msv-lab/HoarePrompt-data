The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It obtains input through a call to `inp().split()`, which is expected to return a string of space-separated values. These values are then converted to integers and collected into a list. The function returns this list of integers.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from converting the space-separated elements of a string obtained by calling `inp().split()`.**
