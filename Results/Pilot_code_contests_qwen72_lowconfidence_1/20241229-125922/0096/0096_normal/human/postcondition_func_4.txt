The function `func_5` reads a line from a file object `f`, splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error. The file object `f` remains open after the function execution.
