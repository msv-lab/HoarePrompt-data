The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from a file object `f`, which is assumed to be open and iterable. It then strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the line and returns a list of characters from the stripped line. If the file is empty or the end of the file is reached, it will return an empty list.
