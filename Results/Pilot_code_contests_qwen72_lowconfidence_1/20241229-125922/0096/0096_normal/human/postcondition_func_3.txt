The function `func_4` reads a single line from a file object `f`, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the integer representation of the stripped line. If the line cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., due to non-numeric characters), a `ValueError` will be raised. The file object `f` is advanced by one line after the function call.
