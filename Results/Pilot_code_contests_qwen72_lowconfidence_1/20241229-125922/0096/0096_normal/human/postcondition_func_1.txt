The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `case_num` and a sequence of integers or strings `iterable`. It prints a formatted string that includes the `case_num` and the `iterable`. However, the function does not return any value based on the `case_num` as described in the annotations. Instead, it only prints the formatted string and then the function ends. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the formatted string has been printed to the console, and no value is returned. Potential edge cases include an empty `iterable`, which would still result in the formatted string being printed, but it might not be meaningful.
