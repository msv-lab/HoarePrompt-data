The function `func_6` reads a single line from a file object `f` and processes it. It expects the line to contain space-separated values where the first value can be converted to an integer and the second value is a string. The function returns a tuple containing the integer value of the first element and the stripped string of the second element. If the line does not contain at least two elements or if the first element cannot be converted to an integer, the function will raise a `ValueError` or `IndexError`.
