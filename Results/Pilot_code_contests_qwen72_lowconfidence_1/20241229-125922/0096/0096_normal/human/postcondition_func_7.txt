The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. If `x` is 0, the function returns '0'. If `x` is negative, the function returns the binary representation of the absolute value of `x`. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, and passing such inputs will result in a TypeError.
