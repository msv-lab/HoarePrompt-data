The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `case_num`, which is a positive integer representing a case number, and `iterable`, which is a collection of integers representing the counts of presses for each letter from 'a' to 'z'. The function prints a formatted string that includes the case number and the space-separated counts of presses. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged except for the output printed to the console. Potential edge cases include an empty `iterable` or a non-positive `case_num`, but the function does not handle these cases specifically and will still attempt to print the formatted string.
