You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You want to perform the combo on your opponent in one popular fighting game. The combo is the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. To perform the combo, you have to press all buttons in the order they appear in s. I.e. if s="abca" then you have to press 'a', then 'b', 'c' and 'a' again.

You know that you will spend m wrong tries to perform the combo and during the i-th try you will make a mistake right after p_i-th button (1 ≤ p_i < n) (i.e. you will press first p_i buttons right and start performing the combo from the beginning). It is guaranteed that during the m+1-th try you press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.

I.e. if s="abca", m=2 and p = [1, 3] then the sequence of pressed buttons will be 'a' (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a', 'b', 'c', (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a' (note that at this point you will not perform the combo because of the mistake), 'b', 'c', 'a'.

Your task is to calculate for each button (letter) the number of times you'll press it.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of s and the number of tries correspondingly.

The second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

The third line of each test case contains m integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_m (1 ≤ p_i < n) — the number of characters pressed right during the i-th try.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m both does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, ∑ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

It is guaranteed that the answer for each letter does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^9.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — 26 integers: the number of times you press the button 'a', the number of times you press the button 'b', ..., the number of times you press the button 'z'.

Note

The first test case is described in the problem statement. Wrong tries are "a", "abc" and the final try is "abca". The number of times you press 'a' is 4, 'b' is 2 and 'c' is 2.

In the second test case, there are five wrong tries: "co", "codeforc", "cod", "co", "codeforce" and the final try is "codeforces". The number of times you press 'c' is 9, 'd' is 4, 'e' is 5, 'f' is 3, 'o' is 9, 'r' is 3 and 's' is 1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it handles the counts for the characters. Specifically, the issue lies in the following part of `func_9`:

```python
res = [x for x in dp[n]]
for i in range(m):
    x = p[i]
    for j in range(26):
        res[j] += dp[x][j]
```

This code correctly adds the counts for the characters up to the mistake points (`p[i]`) but fails to account for the fact that the final successful attempt should also be included in the total count. This means that the final successful attempt's characters are not being counted correctly.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 2
abca
1 3
```

- First wrong try: "a" (mistake after 1st character)
- Second wrong try: "abc" (mistake after 3rd character)
- Final successful try: "abca"

The expected output should be:
```
4 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

However, the current program will output:
```
3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This is because the final successful attempt "abca" is not fully counted. The character 'a' in the final attempt is missed, leading to an incorrect count.

To fix this, the final successful attempt should be added to the result:

```python
res = [x for x in dp[n]]
for i in range(m):
    x = p[i]
    for j in range(26):
        res[j] += dp[x][j]
for j in range(26):
    res[j] += dp[n][j]
```

With this correction, the program will correctly count the characters for all attempts, including the final successful one.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 10 : The function `func_10` processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `T`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list `p` of `m` integers. It then calls `func_9` with these parameters, storing the result in `x`. Depending on whether the `xrange` function is available in the built-in namespace, the function either prints `x` to the console or writes it to an output stream. After processing all test cases, if `xrange` is in the built-in namespace, the output stream is closed. The final state of the program includes `T` being a positive integer, `n` and `m` being the final values returned by `func_5` after the last iteration, `s` being the final string of lowercase Latin letters, `p` being the final list of `m` integers, and `i` being `T-1`. The result `x` from the last iteration is stored, and the output stream is closed if `xrange` is in the built-in namespace.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
