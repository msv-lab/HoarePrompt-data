#State of the program right berfore the function call: case_num is a positive integer representing the case number, and iterable is a collection of integers representing the counts of presses for each letter from 'a' to 'z'.
def func_1(case_num, iterable):
    print('Case #{}: {}'.format(case_num, ' '.join(map(str, iterable))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `case_num`, which is a positive integer representing a case number, and `iterable`, which is a collection of integers representing the counts of presses for each letter from 'a' to 'z'. The function prints a formatted string that includes the case number and the space-separated counts of presses. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged except for the output printed to the console. Potential edge cases include an empty `iterable` or a non-positive `case_num`, but the function does not handle these cases specifically and will still attempt to print the formatted string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case_num is a positive integer representing the case number, and iterable is a sequence of integers or strings.
def func_2(case_num, iterable):
    print('Case #{}: {}'.format(case_num, iterable))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `case_num` and a sequence of integers or strings `iterable`. It prints a formatted string that includes the `case_num` and the `iterable`. However, the function does not return any value based on the `case_num` as described in the annotations. Instead, it only prints the formatted string and then the function ends. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the formatted string has been printed to the console, and no value is returned. Potential edge cases include an empty `iterable`, which would still result in the formatted string being printed, but it might not be meaningful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is a list of strings where each string represents a non-negative integer.
def func_3(A):
    print(' '.join(A))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `A` of strings, where each string represents a non-negative integer. It prints the elements of the list `A` joined by a single space. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `A` remains unchanged, and the output is a single line of text containing the concatenated strings from `A` separated by spaces. Edge cases include an empty list, which would result in an empty string being printed, and a list with a single element, which would print that element without any trailing space.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_4`. This function reads a single line from a file object `f` and returns the integer representation of the stripped line.
def func_4():
    return int(f.readline().strip())
    #The program returns the integer representation of the stripped line read from the file object `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a single line from a file object `f`, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the integer representation of the stripped line. If the line cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., due to non-numeric characters), a `ValueError` will be raised. The file object `f` is advanced by one line after the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and is designed to read a line from a file object `f` and convert it into a list of integers.
def func_5():
    return [int(x) for x in f.readline().strip().split(' ')]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the first line of the file object `f`. Each integer in the list was originally separated by spaces in the line read from the file.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a line from a file object `f`, splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in an error. The file object `f` remains open after the function execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, but it reads from a file object `f` which is expected to contain lines of space-separated values. The first value is expected to be an integer, and the second value is a string.
def func_6():
    a = [x for x in f.readline().split(' ')]
    return int(a[0]), a[1].strip()
    #The program returns the integer value of the first element in list `a` and the stripped string of the second element in list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` reads a single line from a file object `f` and processes it. It expects the line to contain space-separated values where the first value can be converted to an integer and the second value is a string. The function returns a tuple containing the integer value of the first element and the stripped string of the second element. If the line does not contain at least two elements or if the first element cannot be converted to an integer, the function will raise a `ValueError` or `IndexError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function, and it reads a line from a file object `f` which is assumed to be open and iterable, returning a list of characters from the stripped line.
def func_7():
    return list(f.readline().strip())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the stripped line read from the file object `f`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line from a file object `f`, which is assumed to be open and iterable. It then strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the line and returns a list of characters from the stripped line. If the file is empty or the end of the file is reached, it will return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_8(x):
    return bin(x)[2:]
    #The program returns the binary representation of integer 'x' as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts an integer `x` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. If `x` is 0, the function returns '0'. If `x` is negative, the function returns the binary representation of the absolute value of `x`. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, and passing such inputs will result in a TypeError.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code step by step, considering the initial state and the changes made during each iteration.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`.
    #- `n` is a positive integer.
    #- `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n`.
    #- `m` is a positive integer.
    #- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character.
    #- `res` is a list containing the elements from the `n`-th row of `dp`.
    #
    #### Code of the Loop:
    #```python
    #for i in range(m):
    #    x = p[i]
    #    for j in range(26):
    #        res[j] += dp[x][j]
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
    #   - `x = p[0]`
    #   - For each `j` in `range(26)`, `res[j]` is updated to `res[j] + dp[p[0]][j]`.
    #   - After this iteration, `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` becomes `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j]`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
    #   - `x = p[1]`
    #   - For each `j` in `range(26)`, `res[j]` is updated to `res[j] + dp[p[1]][j]`.
    #   - After this iteration, `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` becomes `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j] + dp[p[1]][j]`.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
    #   - `x = p[2]`
    #   - For each `j` in `range(26)`, `res[j]` is updated to `res[j] + dp[p[2]][j]`.
    #   - After this iteration, `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` becomes `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j] + dp[p[1]][j] + dp[p[2]][j]`.
    #
    #4. **General Case (i = k, where 0 ≤ k < m):**
    #   - `x = p[k]`
    #   - For each `j` in `range(26)`, `res[j]` is updated to `res[j] + dp[p[k]][j]`.
    #   - After this iteration, `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` becomes `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j] + dp[p[1]][j] + ... + dp[p[k]][j]`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #After all `m` iterations of the loop, the final state of the variables will be:
    #- `s` remains a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`.
    #- `n` remains a positive integer.
    #- `p` remains a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n`.
    #- `m` remains a positive integer.
    #- `dp` remains a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character.
    #- `res` is a list where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is the sum of `dp[n][j]` and the cumulative counts of the character corresponding to `j` at positions `p[0], p[1], ..., p[m-1]` in the string `s`.
    #
    #Therefore, the Output State is:
    #**`s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n`, `m` is a positive integer, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character, `res` is a list where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`.**
    return ' '.join(map(str, res))
    #The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`. Each `res[j]` represents the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `n`-th character, plus the cumulative counts at the positions specified in `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters, a positive integer `n` indicating the length of `s`, a list of integers `p` where each element is less than `n`, and a positive integer `m` indicating the number of elements in `p`. It modifies `s` by prepending a '0' to it, creating a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 25, representing 'a' to 'z') from the start of the modified `s` up to and including the `i`-th character. The function then iterates over the positions specified in `p`, updating a result list `res` to accumulate the cumulative counts of characters at these positions. Finally, it returns a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`. This means `res[j]` represents the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to the `n`-th character, plus the cumulative counts at the positions specified in `p`.

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will prepend '0' to it, making `s` a string of length 1. The `dp` table will still be constructed, but the subsequent operations will not be meaningful since there are no characters in `s` to count.
- If `p` is an empty list, the function will still construct the `dp` table and initialize `res` based on `dp[n]`, but no additional updates will be made to `res` from `p`.
- If `n` is 1, the function will still prepend '0' to `s`, making `s` a string of length 2. The `dp` table will be constructed, but the only meaningful character count will be for the single character in the original `s`.
- If `p` contains duplicate values, the function will still add the same cumulative counts multiple times, which might not be the intended behavior.
- If `p` contains values that are out of bounds (i.e., greater than or equal to `n`), the function will raise an index error when accessing `dp[p[i]]`.

Final State After Execution:
- `s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `p` remains a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n`.
- `m` remains a positive integer.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character.
- `res` is a list where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`.
- The function returns a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and m are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and p is a list of m integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n.

If `'xrange'` is not in the built-in namespace, `x` has been printed `T` times. If `'xrange'` is in the built-in namespace, `x` has been written to the output stream `T` times.

If `'xrange'` is in the built-in namespace, the output stream is closed. If `'xrange'` is not in the built-in namespace, `x` has been printed `T` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `T`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list `p` of `m` integers. It then calls `func_9` with these parameters, storing the result in `x`. Depending on whether the `xrange` function is available in the built-in namespace, the function either prints `x` to the console or writes it to an output stream. After processing all test cases, if `xrange` is in the built-in namespace, the output stream is closed. The final state of the program includes `T` being a positive integer, `n` and `m` being the final values returned by `func_5` after the last iteration, `s` being the final string of lowercase Latin letters, `p` being the final list of `m` integers, and `i` being `T-1`. The result `x` from the last iteration is stored, and the output stream is closed if `xrange` is in the built-in namespace.
