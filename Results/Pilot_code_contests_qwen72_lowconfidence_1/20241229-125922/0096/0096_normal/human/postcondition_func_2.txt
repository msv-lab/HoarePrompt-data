The function `func_3` accepts a list `A` of strings, where each string represents a non-negative integer. It prints the elements of the list `A` joined by a single space. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `A` remains unchanged, and the output is a single line of text containing the concatenated strings from `A` separated by spaces. Edge cases include an empty list, which would result in an empty string being printed, and a list with a single element, which would print that element without any trailing space.
