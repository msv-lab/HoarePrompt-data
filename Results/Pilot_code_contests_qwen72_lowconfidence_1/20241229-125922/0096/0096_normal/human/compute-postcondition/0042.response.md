To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n` and `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character.
- `res[0]` is `dp[n][0] + dp[p[0]][0] + dp[p[1]][0]`.
- `res[j]` for `j > 0` is `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is `p[1]`.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive), which means it will execute 26 times.
- The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

### Current State:
- `j` is 0.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` will be incremented from 0 to 1.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n` and `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character, `res[0]` is `dp[n][0] + dp[p[0]][0] + dp[p[1]][0]`, `res[j]` for `j > 0` is `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1]`, `j` is 1**
