The function `func_10` accepts no parameters directly within its definition, but based on the context provided, it should be assumed that the function processes input related to the constraints given. However, since the actual parameters are not defined within the function signature, we will assume that the function is expected to handle inputs passed through other means (e.g., global variables, input from stdin, etc.). The constraints indicate that the function deals with:

- A positive integer `T` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, two positive integers `n` and `m` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`.
- A string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- A list `p` of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies `1 ≤ p_i < n`.

Given these inputs, the function is expected to produce some output, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Based on common practices in algorithmic problems, the function might return a result for each test case, possibly a transformed version of the string `s` or a processed form of the list `p`.

However, without more specific details on the intended output, the most accurate description of the function's functionality based on the provided constraints is:

Functionality: **The function processes inputs including a number of test cases `T`, for each test case, integers `n` and `m`, a string `s` of length `n`, and a list `p` of `m` integers. It returns a result based on these inputs, though the exact nature of the output is not specified.**
