The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_5()` to the variables `n` and `m`. According to the initial state, `n` and `m` are already described as the new values returned by `func_5()`, so this reassignment does not change their values. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are the new values returned by `func_5()`, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `p` is the tuple `(n, m)`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`. If `'xrange'` is not in the built-ins directory, `x` remains as the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`. Otherwise, the value of `x` has been printed to the output stream.**
