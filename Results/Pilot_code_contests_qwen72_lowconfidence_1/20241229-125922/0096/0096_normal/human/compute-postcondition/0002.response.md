The code snippet `n, m = func_5()` assigns new values to the variables `n` and `m` by calling the function `func_5()`. The specific values of `n` and `m` after this assignment depend on the return values of `func_5()`. However, the initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within certain ranges. After the execution of the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to whatever `func_5()` returns, but they will still be positive integers.

The other variables (`T`, `s`, `p`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 (values updated by `func_5()`), `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `p` is a list of m integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n, `i` is 0.**
