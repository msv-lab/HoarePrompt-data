Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are the final values returned by `func_5()` after the last iteration, `s` is the final string of lowercase Latin letters, `p` is the final list of `m` integers, `i` is `T-1`, `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)` from the last iteration. If `'xrange'` is in the built-in namespace, the output stream is closed. If `'xrange'` is not in the built-in namespace, `x` has been printed `T` times.***
