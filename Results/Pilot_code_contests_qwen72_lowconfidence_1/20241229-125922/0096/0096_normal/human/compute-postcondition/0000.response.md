The value of `T` is updated by the function call `func_4()`. The exact value of `T` depends on the implementation of `func_4()`, but since `T` is described as a positive integer representing the number of test cases, we can assume `func_4()` returns a positive integer.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, and `p`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`T` is the result of `func_4()`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `p` is a list of m integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n.**
