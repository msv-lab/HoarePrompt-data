To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state based on the conditions required for the `range(T)` to generate at least one iteration. Specifically, `T` must be a positive integer. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: The value of `T` is the result of `func_4()`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.
3. **Other Variables**: The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `p` are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the overall state.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `T` is a positive integer. Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `p` is a list of m integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n, `i` is 0**.
