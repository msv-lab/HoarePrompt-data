The value of `x` is updated to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` is now equal to `p[1]`. The rest of the variables and their properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 â‰¤ p_i < n`, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character, `res` is a list where each element `res[j]` is `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1]`.**
