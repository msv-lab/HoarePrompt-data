To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the impact of the loop on the variables involved. Specifically, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 25, and within the loop, the value of `res[j]` is updated.

Given the current state:
- `s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n` and `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character.
- `res[0]` is `dp[n][0] + dp[p[0]][0] + dp[p[1]][0] + dp[p[2]][0]`.
- `res[j]` for all `j` in range 1 to 25 is `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j] + dp[p[1]][j]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is `p[2]`.
- `j` is 0.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State of `j`**:
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is 0.
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 for each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration (where `j` is 0), `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is still less than 26.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:

- `j` will be 1.
- The value of `res[1]` will be updated in the next iteration to `res[1] + dp[p[2]][1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`s` is a string of length `n + 1` starting with '0' followed by the original `s`, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a sorted list of `m` integers where `1 ≤ p_i < n` and `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x 26` where `dp[i][j]` is the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `i`-th character, `res[0]` is `dp[n][0] + dp[p[0]][0] + dp[p[1]][0] + dp[p[2]][0]`, `res[1]` is `dp[n][1] + dp[p[0]][1] + dp[p[1]][1]`, `res[j]` for all `j` in range 2 to 25 is `dp[n][j] + dp[p[0]][j] + dp[p[1]][j]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `p[2]`, `j` is 1.**
