The values of `n` and `m` are updated by the function `func_5()`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified ranges, but they are overwritten by the new values returned by `func_5()`. The other variables (`T`, `s`, `p`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are the new values returned by `func_5()`, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (value updated by `func_7()`), `p` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 â‰¤ p_i < n, `i` is 1, `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`**
