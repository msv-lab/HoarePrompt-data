The code snippet `p = func_5()` assigns a new value to the variable `p` by calling the function `func_5()`. According to the initial state, `func_5()` updates the values of `n` and `m` to be positive integers within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and sets `p` to be a list of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n.

The other variables (`T`, `s`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 (values updated by `func_5()`), `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (value updated by `func_7()`), `p` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n, `i` is 0.**
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (value updated by `func_7()`), `p` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n, `i` is 0.**
