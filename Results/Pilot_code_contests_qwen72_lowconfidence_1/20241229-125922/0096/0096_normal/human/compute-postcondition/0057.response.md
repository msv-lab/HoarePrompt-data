Output State: **The program returns a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`. Each `res[j]` represents the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` from the start of `s` up to and including the `n`-th character, plus the cumulative counts at the positions specified in `p`.**
