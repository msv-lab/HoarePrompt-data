Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (value updated by `func_7()`), `p` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i < n, `i` is 0, `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`. If `'xrange'` is not in the built-in namespace, no additional changes occur. If `'xrange'` is in the built-in namespace, the string representation of `x` has been printed to `output`.***
