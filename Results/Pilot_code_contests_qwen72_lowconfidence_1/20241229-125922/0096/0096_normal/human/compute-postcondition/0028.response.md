Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (result of `func_4()`), `n` and `m` are the final values returned by `func_5()` after the last iteration, `s` is the final string of lowercase Latin letters (updated by `func_7()` in the last iteration), `p` is the final list of `m` integers (updated by `func_5()` in the last iteration), `i` is `T-1`, and `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)` from the last iteration. `'xrange'` is in the built-in namespace, and `x` has been written to the output stream `T` times.***
