The code `p = func_5()` assigns the result of calling `func_5()` to the variable `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is a positive integer.
- `n` and `m` are the new values returned by `func_5()`.
- `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (updated).
- `p` is the tuple `(n, m)`.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`.

After executing the code `p = func_5()`, the value of `p` is updated to the result of `func_5()`, which is a tuple `(n, m)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are the new values returned by `func_5()`, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (updated), `p` is the tuple `(n, m)`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`.**
