The function `func_9` accepts four parameters: `s`, `n`, `p`, and `m`. 

- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `p` is a list of `m` integers, where each integer `p_i` satisfies `1 â‰¤ p_i < n`.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `p`.

The function returns a space-separated string of the elements in `res`, where each element `res[j]` for all `j` in `range(26)` is calculated as `dp[n][j] + sum(dp[p[i]][j] for i in range(m))`. Each `res[j]` represents the cumulative count of the character corresponding to `j` (from 'a' to 'z') from the start of `s` up to and including the `n`-th character, plus the cumulative counts at the positions specified in `p`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters, a positive integer `n` indicating the length of `s`, a list of integers `p` where each element is less than `n`, and a positive integer `m` indicating the number of elements in `p`. It returns a space-separated string of 26 integers, each representing the cumulative count of a character ('a' to 'z') from the start of `s` up to the `n`-th character, plus the cumulative counts at the positions specified in `p`.**
