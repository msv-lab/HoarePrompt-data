Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `m` are the new values returned by `func_5()`, `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters (updated), `p` is the tuple `(n, m)`, and `i` is 2. If `'xrange'` is not in the built-in functions, `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)` and has been printed. Otherwise, `x` is the result of `func_9(s, n, p, m)`.***
