You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You want to perform the combo on your opponent in one popular fighting game. The combo is the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. To perform the combo, you have to press all buttons in the order they appear in s. I.e. if s="abca" then you have to press 'a', then 'b', 'c' and 'a' again.

You know that you will spend m wrong tries to perform the combo and during the i-th try you will make a mistake right after p_i-th button (1 ≤ p_i < n) (i.e. you will press first p_i buttons right and start performing the combo from the beginning). It is guaranteed that during the m+1-th try you press all buttons right and finally perform the combo.

I.e. if s="abca", m=2 and p = [1, 3] then the sequence of pressed buttons will be 'a' (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a', 'b', 'c', (here you're making a mistake and start performing the combo from the beginning), 'a' (note that at this point you will not perform the combo because of the mistake), 'b', 'c', 'a'.

Your task is to calculate for each button (letter) the number of times you'll press it.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of s and the number of tries correspondingly.

The second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase Latin letters.

The third line of each test case contains m integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_m (1 ≤ p_i < n) — the number of characters pressed right during the i-th try.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m both does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, ∑ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

It is guaranteed that the answer for each letter does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^9.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — 26 integers: the number of times you press the button 'a', the number of times you press the button 'b', ..., the number of times you press the button 'z'.

2 1 1 2 9 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 1 1 5 4 11 8 2 7 5 1 10 1 5 2 

Note

The first test case is described in the problem statement. Wrong tries are "a", "abc" and the final try is "abca". The number of times you press 'a' is 4, 'b' is 2 and 'c' is 2.

In the second test case, there are five wrong tries: "co", "codeforc", "cod", "co", "codeforce" and the final try is "codeforces". The number of times you press 'c' is 9, 'd' is 4, 'e' is 5, 'f' is 3, 'o' is 9, 'r' is 3 and 's' is 1.
Program:
```
def func_10():
    T = func_4()
    for i in range(T):
        (n, m) = func_5()
        s = func_7()
        p = func_5()
        x = func_9(s, n, p, m)
        if 'xrange' not in dir(__builtins__):
            print(x)
        else:
            (print >> output, str(x))
    if 'xrange' in dir(__builtins__):
        print(output.getvalue())
        output.close()
```
