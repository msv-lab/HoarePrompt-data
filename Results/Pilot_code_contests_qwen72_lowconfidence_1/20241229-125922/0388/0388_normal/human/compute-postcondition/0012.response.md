The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. Since `at_start` remains False, this means that previously `file` has already written `str(x)` followed by `sep`. Now, it will write another `str(x)` without appending `sep`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout`. If `at_start` is False, `file` has written `str(x)` followed by `sep` to it, and now it has also written `str(x)`. `at_start` remains False, and `x` is the next element in `args`.**
