The code assigns the value of the 'sep' key from `kwargs` to the variable `sep`, defaulting to a single space if 'sep' is not present in `kwargs`. Similarly, it assigns the value of the 'file' key from `kwargs` to the variable `file`, defaulting to `sys.stdout` if 'file' is not present in `kwargs`. After these assignments, the keys 'sep' and 'file' are removed from `kwargs`.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' (with 'end' defaulting to a newline character and 'flush' defaulting to False), sep is the value of 'sep' from kwargs if it exists otherwise a single space, file is the value of 'file' from kwargs if it exists otherwise sys.stdout.**
