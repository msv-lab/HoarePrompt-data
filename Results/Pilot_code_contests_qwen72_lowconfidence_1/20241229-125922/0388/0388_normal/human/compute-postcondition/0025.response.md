Functionality: ** The function `func_2` prints the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified output stream, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The elements are separated by a separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After writing the elements, the function appends a string specified by the `end` parameter, which defaults to a newline character. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the output stream is flushed to ensure immediate output. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the used keys ('sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'). If `args` is empty, nothing is written except the `end` character. The final state of the program includes `args` remaining unchanged, `kwargs` potentially modified, and the output stream having received the formatted output. **
