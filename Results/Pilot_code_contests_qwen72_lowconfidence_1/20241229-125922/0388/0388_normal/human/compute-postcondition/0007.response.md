The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object specified by `file`. The variables `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. However, the state of `file` is updated as it now contains the additional content `str(x)`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout` and has written `str(x)` to it, `at_start` is True.**
