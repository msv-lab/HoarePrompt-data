The line of code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` performs the following actions:

- It looks up the key `'end'` in the dictionary `kwargs`. If `'end'` is found, its value is used; if not, the default value `'\n'` (newline character) is used.
- This value is then written to the file object `file`.
- The key `'end'` is removed from the dictionary `kwargs`.

Given the initial state, the impact on the program and the variables involved is:

- The `file` object, which could be `sys.stdout` or another file specified in `kwargs`, writes the value associated with `'end'` from `kwargs` or a newline character if `'end'` is not in `kwargs`.
- The key `'end'` is removed from the dictionary `kwargs`.
- Other variables (`args`, `sep`, `at_start`) remain unchanged unless they are implicitly affected by the writing operation, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'flush' but not 'end', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout`, `file` has written the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` (if `args` has more than one element), `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains True, and the value of 'end' from `kwargs` or a newline character has been written to `file`.**
