Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout`. If `at_start` is False, `file` has written `str(x)` followed by `sep` to it. `at_start` remains False, and `x` is the next element in `args`.***
