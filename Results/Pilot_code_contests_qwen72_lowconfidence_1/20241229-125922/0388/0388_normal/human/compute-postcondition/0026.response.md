The provided code snippet for `func_1()` does not include any parameters, which seems inconsistent with the parameter constraints mentioned (`n` and `i` are positive integers). However, based on the given constraints and assuming these parameters should be part of the function, I will proceed with the description.

The function `func_1` is expected to accept two parameters, `n` and `i`, where both `n` and `i` are positive integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8. Since no specific output or behavior is described for the function, I cannot determine what the function returns without additional information. However, I will provide a general description based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `i`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5 and `i` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8. The function's return value is not specified in the provided information.**

If you can provide more details about the expected output or behavior of the function, I can refine the description accordingly.
