The provided code snippet is a docstring comment that describes what a print function does. It does not perform any actual operation or change any variable state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of elements of any type, and kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' defaults to a single space, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline character, and 'flush' defaults to False.**
