The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `args` and `kwargs`. `args` is a tuple that can contain any number of elements of any type. `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The default values for these keys are: 'sep' is a single space, 'file' is `sys.stdout`, 'end' is a newline character, and 'flush' is `False`.

The function does not return a specific value; instead, it is likely used to perform an operation such as printing or writing to a file, but the exact output behavior is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts `args` as a tuple of any number of elements of any type and `kwargs` as a dictionary with optional keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. It performs an operation (likely printing or writing) using these parameters, with 'sep' defaulting to a single space, 'file' to `sys.stdout`, 'end' to a newline character, and 'flush' to `False`.**
