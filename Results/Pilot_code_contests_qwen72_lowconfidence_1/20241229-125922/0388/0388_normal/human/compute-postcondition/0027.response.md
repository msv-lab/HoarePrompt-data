Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `i` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5` and `1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8`. It then reads a list of `n` integers, counts the frequency of each integer, and sorts these frequencies in ascending order. The function calculates a prefix sum array `pref` of these frequencies. It computes the minimum value of `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all valid indices `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`, where `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`. If `len(pref) - md` is less than or equal to 0, `s` is set to 0. Finally, the function calls another function `func_2` with the computed value of `s`. The function does not return any value directly. **

Edge Cases:
- If the input list is empty, `ca` will be empty, and `pref` will remain `[0]`. In this case, `s` will be set to 0 because `len(pref) - md` will be less than or equal to 0.
- If `md` is greater than or equal to `len(pref)`, the loop will not execute, and `s` will be set to 0.
- If `i` is very small, `md` might be 1, leading to a simpler calculation of `s`.

Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-bounds values for `n` and `i`).
- The function does not return a value but instead calls another function `func_2` with the result. The behavior of `func_2` is not defined in the provided code.
