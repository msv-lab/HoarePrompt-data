To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given code:

1. **args**: The loop iterates over the elements in `args`, which is a tuple. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element.
2. **kwargs**: This dictionary may contain the keys 'end', 'flush', 'sep', and 'file'. The values of these keys are used within the loop, but they do not affect the loop's execution directly.
3. **sep**: This variable is derived from `kwargs` if the key 'sep' exists; otherwise, it defaults to a single space.
4. **file**: This variable is derived from `kwargs` if the key 'file' exists; otherwise, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
5. **at_start**: This variable is set to `True` and is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.

Given these points, the loop will execute if and only if `args` contains at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `args` is not empty.

State: **`args` is a tuple containing at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'end' and 'flush' (with 'end' defaulting to a newline character and 'flush' defaulting to False), `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is True**
