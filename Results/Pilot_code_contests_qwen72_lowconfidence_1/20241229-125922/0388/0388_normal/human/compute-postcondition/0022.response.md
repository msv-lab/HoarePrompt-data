The method `file.flush()` ensures that any buffered data in `file` is written out to the underlying file or stream. This does not change the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state, but it affects the state of the file object.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the key 'flush' but not 'end', `sep` is the value of 'sep' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise a single space, `file` is the value of 'file' from `kwargs` if it exists otherwise `sys.stdout`, `file` has written the string representation of each element in `args` separated by `sep` (if `args` has more than one element), `at_start` is False if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains True, the value of 'end' from `kwargs` or a newline character has been written to `file`, `file` has been flushed.**
