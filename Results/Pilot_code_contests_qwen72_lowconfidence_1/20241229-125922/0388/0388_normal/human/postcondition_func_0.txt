The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `i` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5` and `1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8`. It then reads a list of `n` integers, counts the frequency of each integer, and sorts these frequencies in ascending order. The function calculates a prefix sum array `pref` of these frequencies. It computes the minimum value of `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all valid indices `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`, where `md` is calculated as `int(2
