Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of changes required to compress the sound file so that it fits into the given disk size. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Calculation of `md`:** The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`. This calculation is intended to determine the maximum number of distinct values that can be stored within the disk size `I` (in bytes). However, the formula used here is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate the number of distinct values that can be stored in `I` bytes is `2 ** (8 * I / n)`, but the integer conversion using `int()` can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, `int()` truncates the result, which can result in a value that is too small. For example, if `2 ** (8 * i / n)` is slightly less than an integer, `int()` will truncate it, leading to an incorrect `md`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:** The function does not handle the case where the entire file already fits into the disk without any compression. In such cases, the number of changes should be `0`. The current implementation sets `s = 0` if `len(pref) - md <= 0`, but this logic is flawed. It assumes that if the number of distinct values is less than or equal to `md`, no changes are needed. However, this does not consider the actual size of the file in bits.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The prefix sum array `pref` is used to calculate the number of elements within a range of distinct values. However, the logic for finding the minimum number of changes is not robust. The loop `for i in range(len(pref) - md):` might not cover all possible ranges, especially if the number of distinct values is close to `md`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly edge cases and the correct calculation of `md`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
