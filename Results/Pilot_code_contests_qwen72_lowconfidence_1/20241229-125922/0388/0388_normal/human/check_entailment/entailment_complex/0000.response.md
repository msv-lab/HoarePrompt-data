Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the calculation of `md`. According to the problem description, `md` should be the smallest integer such that \( K \leq 2^{md} \), where \( K \) is the number of distinct values in the array. However, the code incorrectly sets `md` to `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`, which does not match the required formula.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( i = 1 \). The number of distinct values \( K = 3 \). The correct value of \( md \) should be \( \lceil \log_2 3 \rceil = 2 \).

However, the code calculates:
```python
md = int(2 ** (8 * 1 / 6))  # This evaluates to 2
```
This calculation is incorrect because it does not compute the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of the number of distinct values. Instead, it computes a different value that does not align with the problem's requirements.

To fix this, the correct calculation for `md` should be:
```python
K = len(ca)
md = (K - 1).bit_length()  # This computes the smallest integer k such that K <= 2^k
```

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the number of distinct values \( K \) is 1 correctly. If \( K = 1 \), then \( md \) should be 0, but the current code will set `md` to 1, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
Here, \( n = 6 \), \( i = 1 \), and \( K = 1 \). The correct value of \( md \) should be 0, but the code will set `md` to 1, leading to incorrect results.

These issues indicate that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
