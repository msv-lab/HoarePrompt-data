Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The issue lies in the calculation of `md` in the function `func_1`. According to the problem description, the number of bits required to store each value is \( k = \lceil \log_2 K \rceil \), where \( K \) is the number of distinct values in the array. The total number of bits required to store the entire file is \( nk \). The disk size \( I \) is given in bytes, so the total number of bits available is \( 8I \).

The variable `md` is intended to represent the maximum number of distinct values \( K \) that can fit within the disk size. However, the current implementation of `md` is:

```python
md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
```

This formula is incorrect because it does not properly calculate \( K \) such that \( nk \leq 8I \). Instead, it should calculate \( K \) as the largest integer such that \( k = \lceil \log_2 K \rceil \) and \( nk \leq 8I \).

The correct calculation should be:

```python
import math
md = 2 ** (math.ceil(math.log2(min(n, 8 * i // n + 1))))
```

This ensures that `md` is the maximum number of distinct values \( K \) that can fit within the disk size \( I \).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

- \( n = 6 \)
- \( I = 1 \) byte, so \( 8I = 8 \) bits

The correct number of bits required to store each value \( k \) should be \( \lceil \log_2 6 \rceil = 3 \) bits. Therefore, the total number of bits required is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) bits, which exceeds 8 bits. Hence, we need to compress the data.

The correct approach would be to choose a range `[l, r]` such that the number of distinct values is minimized while fitting within the disk size. However, the current implementation of `md` will incorrectly calculate the number of distinct values, leading to an incorrect solution.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
