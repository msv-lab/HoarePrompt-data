Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The program has a logical issue in the calculation of `md`. According to the problem description, the number of bits required to store each value is given by \( k = \lceil \log_2 K \rceil \), and the total number of bits required to store the entire file is \( nk \). The disk size \( I \) is given in bytes, so the total number of bits available is \( 8I \). Therefore, the condition for fitting the file onto the disk is:

\[ nk \leq 8I \]

However, the program calculates `md` as follows:

```python
md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
```

This formula is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the number of distinct values \( K \) that can fit into the disk. Instead, it should calculate \( K \) as the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the disk, which is:

\[ K \leq 2^{\left\lfloor \frac{8I}{n} \right\rfloor} \]

Thus, the correct way to calculate `md` should be:

```python
md = 2 ** (8 * i // n)
```

Additionally, the program does not handle the edge case where the number of distinct values \( K \) is 1 correctly. When \( K = 1 \), \( k = 0 \), and the file should always fit into the disk regardless of its size. The current implementation does not account for this edge case properly.

These issues mean that the program will not work correctly for all potential inputs, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
