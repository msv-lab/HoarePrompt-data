You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 1
2 1 2 3 4 3

Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from collections import Counter
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, i) = map(int, input().split())
    ca = sorted(Counter(map(int, input().split())).items(), key=lambda x: x[0])
    md = int(2 ** (8 * i / n))
    pref = [0]
    for (_, j) in ca:
        pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    s = n
    for i in range(len(pref) - md):
        u = pref[i + md] - pref[i]
        s = min(s, n - u)
    if len(pref) - md <= 0:
        s = 0
    func_2(s)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `md`**:
   - The variable `md` is calculated as `int(2 ** (8 * i / n))`. This calculation is intended to determine the maximum number of distinct values that can fit into the disk. However, the formula used here is incorrect. According to the problem, the number of bits required to store each value is `k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉`, and the total number of bits required is `nk`. Therefore, the correct formula to calculate the maximum number of distinct values `K` that can fit into the disk should be:
     \[
     K = 2^{\left\lceil \frac{8I}{n} \right\rceil}
     \]
   - The current implementation uses `2 ** (8 * i / n)` and then converts it to an integer, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `i = 1` and `n = 6`, the correct `K` should be `2` (since `2^3 = 8` bits can store up to 2 distinct values), but the program calculates `2 ** (8/6) ≈ 2.519`, which gets truncated to `2`, leading to incorrect behavior.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the number of distinct values is already less than or equal to the maximum allowed distinct values. In such cases, no compression is needed, and the output should be `0`. The program attempts to handle this with the condition `if len(pref) - md <= 0: s = 0`, but this is not robust and may fail in certain edge cases.

3. **Output Function**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to print the result, but it is not necessary to use a custom print function for this problem. The standard `print` function would suffice and is more straightforward.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` prints the string representations of the elements in `args` to a specified output stream, which defaults to `sys.stdout`. The elements are separated by a separator (`sep`), which defaults to a single space. After writing the elements, the function appends a string specified by the `end` parameter, which defaults to a newline character. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the output stream is flushed to ensure immediate output. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the used keys ('sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'). If `args` is empty, nothing is written except the `end` character. The final state of the program includes `args` remaining unchanged, `kwargs` potentially modified, and the output stream having received the formatted output.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
