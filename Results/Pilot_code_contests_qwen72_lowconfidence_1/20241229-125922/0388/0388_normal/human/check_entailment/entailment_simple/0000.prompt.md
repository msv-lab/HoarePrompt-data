You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One common way of digitalizing sound is to record sound intensity at particular time moments. For each time moment intensity is recorded as a non-negative integer. Thus we can represent a sound file as an array of n non-negative integers.

If there are exactly K distinct values in the array, then we need k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ bits to store each value. It then takes nk bits to store the whole file.

To reduce the memory consumption we need to apply some compression. One common way is to reduce the number of possible intensity values. We choose two integers l ≤ r, and after that all intensity values are changed in the following way: if the intensity value is within the range [l;r], we don't change it. If it is less than l, we change it to l; if it is greater than r, we change it to r. You can see that we lose some low and some high intensities.

Your task is to apply this compression in such a way that the file fits onto a disk of size I bytes, and the number of changed elements in the array is minimal possible.

We remind you that 1 byte contains 8 bits.

k = ⌈ log_{2} K ⌉ is the smallest integer such that K ≤ 2^{k}. In particular, if K = 1, then k = 0.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and I (1 ≤ n ≤ 4 ⋅ 10^{5}, 1 ≤ I ≤ 10^{8}) — the length of the array and the size of the disk in bytes, respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the array denoting the sound file.

Output

Print a single integer — the minimal possible number of changed elements.

Examples

Input


6 2
2 1 2 3 4 3


Output


0


Input


6 1
1 1 2 2 3 3


Output


2

Note

In the first example we can choose l=2, r=3. The array becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3, the number of distinct elements is K=2, and the sound file fits onto the disk. Only two values are changed.

In the second example the disk is larger, so the initial file fits it and no changes are required.

In the third example we have to change both 1s or both 3s.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables involved. The loop iterates over the list `ca`, which contains tuples representing the frequency of each integer from the input, sorted by the integer values. The loop updates the list `pref` by appending the cumulative sum of the frequencies.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5.
    #- `i` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8.
    #- `ca` is a list of tuples representing the frequency of each integer from the input, sorted by the integer values.
    #- `md` is `int(2)`.
    #- `pref` is initialized to `[0]`.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for _, j in ca:
    #    pref.append(pref[-1] + j)
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - The loop starts with the first tuple in `ca`.
    #   - `pref[-1]` is initially `0`.
    #   - `j` is the frequency of the first integer in `ca`.
    #   - `pref` becomes `[0, 0 + j]`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - The loop moves to the second tuple in `ca`.
    #   - `pref[-1]` is now `0 + j` (the result of the first iteration).
    #   - `j` is the frequency of the second integer in `ca`.
    #   - `pref` becomes `[0, 0 + j, (0 + j) + j2]`, where `j2` is the frequency of the second integer.
    #
    #3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    #   - For each subsequent tuple in `ca`, the loop appends the cumulative sum of the frequencies to `pref`.
    #   - After `k` iterations, `pref` will contain `k + 1` elements, where the last element is the sum of the frequencies of the first `k` integers in `ca`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- If `ca` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `pref` remains `[0]`.
    #- If `ca` has at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `ca`.
    #- After all iterations, `pref` will contain the cumulative sums of the frequencies in `ca`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state of the loop is:
    #**`n` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5, `i` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8, `ca` is a list of tuples representing the frequency of each integer from the input, sorted by the integer values, `md` is `int(2)`, `pref` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the frequencies in `ca`, starting with 0. If `ca` is empty, `pref` is `[0]`.**

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is the minimum value of `n - (pref[i + md] - pref[i])` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(pref) - md - 1`, `i` is `len(pref) - md`, `len(pref) > 2`, `ca` contains at least two tuples, `n` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ n ≤ 4 * 10^5, `i` is an input integer within the bounds 1 ≤ i ≤ 10^8, `ca` is a list of tuples representing the frequency of each integer from the input, sorted by the integer values, `md` is `int(2)`, `pref` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the frequencies in `ca`, starting with 0.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
