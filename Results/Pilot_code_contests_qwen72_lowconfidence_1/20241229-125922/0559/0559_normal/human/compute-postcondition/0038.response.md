To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions required for the loop to continue.

### Current State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 2
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` must contain at least one element
- `child` is the first element in `childs`
- `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and `res` is not 'found'
- `next_childs` is `res`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `childs`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `child` will be updated to the next element in `childs`.
   - The loop will proceed if there is at least one more element in `childs`.

### Adjusted State:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1` (unchanged)
- `coord1` and `coord2` remain the same (unchanged)
- `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org` (unchanged)
- `end_coord` remains `coord2` (unchanged)
- `cur_depth` remains 2 (unchanged)
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs` (unchanged)
- `childs` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.
- `child` is now the second element in `childs`.
- `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and `res` is not 'found' (unchanged)
- `next_childs` is `res` (unchanged)

### Final State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `child` is the second element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and `res` is not 'found', `next_childs` is `res`**
