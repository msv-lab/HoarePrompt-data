The code snippet `childs.append(child)` appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`.

Given the initial state:
- `jibun` is a valid key in `graph`.
- `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element.
- `target` is a tuple.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples.
- `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`.
- If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`.
- If `child` is equal to `target`, the program returns 'found'.
- Otherwise, `childs` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `childs` now contains `child` as its first element (assuming `childs` was previously empty or contained only `child`).
- The condition `if child is not in used_coords` is assumed to be true, otherwise, `childs` would not have been initialized with `child`.
- No return statement is executed in this snippet, so the program does not return anything here.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`, `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`, and no value has been returned.**
