Output State: **The program returns 0. The variables `cur_coord`, `coord1`, and `coord2` remain unchanged as tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`. `end_coord` remains `coord2`. `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search. `childs` is an empty list.**
