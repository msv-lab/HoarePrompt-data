You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`).

    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step and consider the changes to the variables over multiple iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
    #- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
    #- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
    #- `end_coord` is `coord2`
    #- `cur_depth` is 0
    #- `used_coords` is `[coord1]`
    #- `childs` is `graph[coord1]`
    #
    #### Loop Execution:
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - `cur_depth` is incremented to 1.
    #   - `used_coords` is updated to `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`.
    #   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
    #   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
    #   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
    #   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
    #
    #2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    #   - `cur_depth` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
    #   - `used_coords` is extended with the current `childs`.
    #   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
    #   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
    #   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
    #   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #The loop continues until `len(childs) == 0`, meaning there are no more unexplored children to process. At this point, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `cur_depth` will be the number of iterations the loop has executed.
    #- `used_coords` will contain all the coordinates that have been explored, starting from `coord1` and including all children explored in each iteration.
    #- `childs` will be an empty list, indicating no more unexplored children.
    #- If `func_2` ever returned 'found', the loop would have exited early, returning `cur_depth + 1`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state is:
    #**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search, `childs` is an empty list.**
    return 0
    #The program returns 0. The variables `cur_coord`, `coord1`, and `coord2` remain unchanged as tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`. `end_coord` remains `coord2`. `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search. `childs` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, both tuples representing road square coordinates. It returns different integer values based on specific cases, ranging from 0 to 4, with additional context provided in Case_10 about the state of various variables.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 2

Case_2: The program returns `cur_depth + 1` which is 2, where `cur_depth` was initially 1.

Case_3: The program returns 2

Case_4: The program returns 3

Case_5: The program returns 3

Case_6: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is 2, so the program returns 3.

Case_7: The program returns 4

Case_8: The program returns 4

Case_9: The program returns 4

Case_10: The program returns 0. The variables `cur_coord`, `coord1`, and `coord2` remain unchanged as tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`. `end_coord` remains `coord2`. `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search. `childs` is an empty list.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
