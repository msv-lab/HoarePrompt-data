The code initializes an empty list named `next_childs`. This does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the creation of this new variable.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `next_childs` is an empty list.**
