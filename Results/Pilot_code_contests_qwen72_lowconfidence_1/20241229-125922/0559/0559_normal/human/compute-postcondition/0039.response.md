The code snippet `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` assigns the result of calling `func_2` with arguments `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords` to the variable `res`.

Given that `res` is already mentioned to be the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and is not 'found', this indicates that the call to `func_2` does not change the value of `res` from its current state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the values of the variables, except for the fact that `res` is explicitly stated to be the result of the function call, which was already part of the initial state.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `child` is the second element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and `res` is not 'found', `next_childs` is `res`**
