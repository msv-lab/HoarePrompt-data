The line `next_childs += res` appends the value of `res` to the list `next_childs`. Given the initial conditions:

- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 2
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` must contain at least two elements
- `child` is the second element in `childs`
- `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. If `res` is 'found', the program returns 3. Otherwise, the program does not return 3 and continues execution.

If `res` is 'found', the program would have already returned 3, and this line would not be executed. Since the program did not return 3, `res` is not 'found', and the line `next_childs += res` is executed.

Thus, the value of `res` is added to `next_childs`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least two elements, `child` is the second element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, `next_childs` is updated to include `res`.**
