The code snippet `childs.append(child)` adds the value of `child` to the list `childs`. Initially, `childs` is an empty list. After the execution of this code, `childs` will contain the value of `child`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, `childs` is a list containing `child`, `child` is not equal to `target`, and `child` is not in `used_coords`.
Output State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, `childs` is a list containing `child`, `child` is not equal to `target`, and `child` is not in `used_coords`**
