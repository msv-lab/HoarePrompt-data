The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the contents of `res` to the list `next_childs`.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 3
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`
- `child` is the next element in `childs`
- If `res` is 'found', the program returns 4. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as before the if-else block.

Impact of the code:
- The list `next_childs` is extended by appending the contents of `res`.
- The value of `res` is added to `next_childs`.

Since the initial state specifies that `res` is not 'found', the program does not return 4, and the state remains the same except for the update to `next_childs`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `child` is the next element in `childs`, `next_childs` is updated by appending the contents of `res`**.
