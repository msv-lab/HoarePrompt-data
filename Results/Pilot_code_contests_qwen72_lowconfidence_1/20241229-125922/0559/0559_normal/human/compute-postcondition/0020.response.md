The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` and `target` are tuples representing coordinates (row, column) of road squares in the maze, and `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing coordinates of road squares that have already been visited. The function returns:

- 'found' if any child of `jibun` equals `target`.
- A list of all unique children of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`.
- An empty list if `graph[jibun]` is empty or all children are in `used_coords` or equal to `target`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. It returns 'found' if any child of `jibun` equals `target`. Otherwise, it returns a list of all unique children of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If `graph[jibun]` is empty or all children are in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, it returns an empty list.**
