The code snippet `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` calls the function `func_2` with arguments `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. The specific impact of this function call depends on the implementation of `func_2`, which is not provided. However, we can infer the following changes:

- A new variable `res` is introduced and is assigned the return value of `func_2`.
- The function `func_2` might modify the state of `used_coords` or any other global variables, but without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine these effects.
- The values of `cur_coord`, `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, and `childs` remain unchanged unless modified within `func_2`.

Given the lack of information about `func_2`, we assume it only returns a value and does not modify its arguments or any other state.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `child` is the next element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**
