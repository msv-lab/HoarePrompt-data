To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `len(childs) != 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `childs` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 1
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`
- `childs` is a list containing unique elements from `next_childs`
- `next_childs` is a list containing all valid results from `func_2` for each `child` in `childs` that did not return 'found'. If `func_2` returned 'found' for any `child`, the loop would have exited early, returning `cur_depth + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `childs` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, the state of `childs` needs to be such that it is not empty. The other states (`cur_coord`, `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`) do not directly affect the loop condition and thus do not need to be modified.

State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` must contain at least one element**
