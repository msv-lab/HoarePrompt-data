Functionality: ** The function `func_1` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path between two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` on a grid. It accepts two parameters: `coord1` and `coord2`, both tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). The function returns an integer value representing the depth (number of steps) taken to find a path, or 0 if no path is found. 

- **Initial State:**
  - `coord1` and `coord2` are unchanged.
  - `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`.
  - `cur_depth` starts at 0.
  - `used_coords` starts with `coord1`.
  - `childs` starts with the neighbors of `coord1` from the `graph`.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The function iteratively explores the neighbors of the current set of coordinates (`childs`).
  - For each neighbor, it calls `func_2` to check if the neighbor is the target (`coord2`).
  - If `func_2` returns 'found', the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
  - Otherwise, it updates `used_coords` with the current set of neighbors and prepares the next set of neighbors to explore.
  - The loop continues until there are no more unexplored neighbors (`childs` is empty).

- **Final State:**
  - If a path is found, the function returns `cur_depth + 1`.
  - If no path is found, the function returns 0.
  - `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
  - `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search.
  - `childs` is an empty list.
  - `coord1` and `coord2` remain unchanged.
  - `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `coord1` and `coord2` are the same, the function will return 1 immediately.
  - If `coord1` has no neighbors in the `graph`, the function will return 0.
  - If `coord2` is not reachable from `coord1`, the function will return 0 after exploring all possible paths. **
