According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the state of `graph[jibun]` and the current value of `child`. At the end of the last iteration, `jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, and `child` is not equal to `target`. If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`. Otherwise, `childs` remains an empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. `child` must be updated to the next element in `graph[jibun]`.
2. `graph[jibun]` must still contain at least one element (excluding the one that was processed in the previous iteration).
3. The conditions regarding `target`, `used_coords`, and `childs` should remain consistent based on the new `child`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, and `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`. If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`. Otherwise, `childs` remains an empty list.**
