The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the contents of `res` to the list `next_childs`. Given that `res` is not 'found', it implies that `res` could be a list or another iterable type. Since `next_childs` was initially an empty list (`[]`), after this operation, `next_childs` will contain the elements from `res`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is now `res`, and `res` is not 'found'.
