To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step and consider the changes to the variables over multiple iterations.

### Initial State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 0
- `used_coords` is `[coord1]`
- `childs` is `graph[coord1]`

### Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `cur_depth` is incremented to 1.
   - `used_coords` is updated to `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`.
   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - `cur_depth` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - `used_coords` is extended with the current `childs`.
   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.

### Final Output State:
The loop continues until `len(childs) == 0`, meaning there are no more unexplored children to process. At this point, the following conditions will hold:

- `cur_depth` will be the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `used_coords` will contain all the coordinates that have been explored, starting from `coord1` and including all children explored in each iteration.
- `childs` will be an empty list, indicating no more unexplored children.
- If `func_2` ever returned 'found', the loop would have exited early, returning `cur_depth + 1`.

Therefore, the final output state is:
**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search, `childs` is an empty list.**
