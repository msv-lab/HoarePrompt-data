To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 3
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`
- `next_childs` is `res`
- `res` is not 'found'

### Loop Statement:
```python
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `childs`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `child` will take the next element from `childs` at the start of each iteration.
   - The list `childs` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it remains unchanged.

### Adjusted State:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1` (unchanged)
- `coord1` and `coord2` remain the same (unchanged)
- `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org` (unchanged)
- `end_coord` remains `coord2` (unchanged)
- `cur_depth` remains 3 (unchanged)
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs` (unchanged)
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs` (unchanged)
- `next_childs` remains `res` (unchanged)
- `res` remains not 'found' (unchanged)
- `child` is set to the next element in `childs`.

### Final State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is `res`, `res` is not 'found', `child` is the next element in `childs`**
