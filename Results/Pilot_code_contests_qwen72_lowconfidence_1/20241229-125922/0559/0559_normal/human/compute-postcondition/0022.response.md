The code snippet `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` updates the value of `res` by calling the function `func_2` with the arguments `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. According to the initial state, `res` is already the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, and it is not 'found'. Since this line of code is essentially a repeat of what was already executed, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is `graph[coord1]` and must be non-empty, `child` is the third element in `childs`, `next_childs` is `res` appended to `next_childs`, `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and is not 'found'.**
