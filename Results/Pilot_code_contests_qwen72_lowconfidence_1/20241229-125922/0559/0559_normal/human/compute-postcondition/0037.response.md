The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the elements from `res` to the list `next_childs`. Given that `res` is not 'found', `res` must be a list or iterable. Since `next_childs` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `next_childs` will contain the elements from `res`.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `child` is the first element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and `res` is not 'found', `next_childs` is `res`.**
