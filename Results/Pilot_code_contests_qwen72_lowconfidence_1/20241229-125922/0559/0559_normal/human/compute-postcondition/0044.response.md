The line of code `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` assigns the result of the function call `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` to the variable `res`. This means that `res` now holds the return value of `func_2`.

Since the initial state specifies that `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, this implies that the assignment does not change the value of `res` from what was already stated in the initial conditions.

However, the impact of the code is that `res` is explicitly set as the result of the function call, which might have side effects or dependencies that are not visible in the given snippet. For the purpose of this task, we focus on the direct changes to the variables.

The rest of the variables (`cur_coord`, `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`, `childs`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least three elements, `child` is the third element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, `next_childs` is updated to include `res`**
