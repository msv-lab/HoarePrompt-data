The function `func_2` is called with parameters `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. The result of this function call is assigned to `res`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can only assume that `res` will be updated based on the outcome of the function. If `func_2` returns a value, `res` will be updated to that value. If `func_2` does not return a value, `res` will remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state will reflect the updated value of `res`:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is `res`, `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, `child` is the next element in `childs`**
