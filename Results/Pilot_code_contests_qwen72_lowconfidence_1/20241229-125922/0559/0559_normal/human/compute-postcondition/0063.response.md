Postcondition: ***`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is `res`, `child` is the next element in `childs`. If `res` == 'found', the program returns 4. Otherwise, the program continues execution as normal without returning.***
