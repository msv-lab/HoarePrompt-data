Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` and `target` are tuples representing coordinates, and `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing coordinates that have already been visited. The function returns 'found' if any neighbor of `jibun` matches the `target`. Otherwise, it returns a list of all unique neighbors of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If `jibun` has no neighbors, or all neighbors are either in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, the function returns an empty list. Edge cases include scenarios where `jibun` is not a valid key in `graph` (which would raise a KeyError), or if `graph[jibun]` is empty, leading to an immediate return of an empty list. **
