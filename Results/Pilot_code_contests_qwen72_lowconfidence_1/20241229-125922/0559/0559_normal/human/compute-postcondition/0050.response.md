To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `len(childs) != 0` holds true. This means that `childs` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`.
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`).
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`.
- `end_coord` is `coord2`.
- `cur_depth` is 2.
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`.
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
- `next_childs` remains as initially defined.

For the loop to execute one more time, `childs` must not be an empty list. Since `childs` is derived from `next_childs` by removing duplicates, `next_childs` must contain at least one element that is not already in `used_coords` and not marked as 'found' by `func_2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `next_childs` contains at least one valid child that is not already in `used_coords` and is not 'found'.

State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` must contain at least one element that is not already in `used_coords` and is not 'found'.**
