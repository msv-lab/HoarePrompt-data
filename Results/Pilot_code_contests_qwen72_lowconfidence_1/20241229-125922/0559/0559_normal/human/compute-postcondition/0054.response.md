To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 3
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`
- `next_childs` is an empty list (`[]`)

### For Loop:
```python
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the `childs` list.
- For the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `next_childs` is an empty list, `childs` will also be empty unless it is explicitly populated with some elements.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `childs` must be non-empty.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `childs` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, and `next_childs` is an empty list (`[]`), but `childs` must contain at least one element.**
