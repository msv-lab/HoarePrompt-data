Postcondition: ***`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, and `child` is not equal to `target`. If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`. Otherwise, `childs` remains an empty list.***
