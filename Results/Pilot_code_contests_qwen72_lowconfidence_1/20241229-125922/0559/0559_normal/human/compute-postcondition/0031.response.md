The code `used_coords += childs` appends the elements of `childs` to the list `used_coords`. Since `used_coords` was initially `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, after executing this line, `used_coords` will include all the elements from `childs`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `next_childs` is an empty list.**
