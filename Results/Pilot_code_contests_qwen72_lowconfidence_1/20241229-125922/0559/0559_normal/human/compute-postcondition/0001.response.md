To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Graph Structure**: The variable `graph` must be a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing a coordinate, and the value is a list of tuples representing the neighboring coordinates (children).

2. **Current Position**: The variable `jibun` must be a valid key in the `graph` dictionary. This ensures that `graph[jibun]` returns a list of children.

3. **Children List**: For the loop to execute, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element (i.e., there must be at least one child).

4. **Loop Variable**: The variable `child` will take on each value in `graph[jibun]` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `jibun` and `target` are tuples representing coordinates.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing coordinates of road squares that have already been visited.
- `childs` is an empty list.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `jibun` is a valid key in `graph` and that `graph[jibun]` is not empty.

State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, `childs` is an empty list**
