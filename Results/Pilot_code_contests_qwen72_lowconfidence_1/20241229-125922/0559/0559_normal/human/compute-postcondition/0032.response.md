To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of `childs` before the loop starts. The loop iterates over each element in `childs`, so for the loop to execute, `childs` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

1. **`childs` must contain at least one element**: This is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`child` is the first element in `childs`**: This is the initial state of `child` before the loop starts.
3. **Other variables**: The other variables (`cur_coord`, `coord1`, `coord2`, `depth_dict`, `end_coord`, `cur_depth`, `used_coords`, `next_childs`) should remain as they are, as they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

Given these points, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `child` is the first element in `childs`, `next_childs` is an empty list.**
