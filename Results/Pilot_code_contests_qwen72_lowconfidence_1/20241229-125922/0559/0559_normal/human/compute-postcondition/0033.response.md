The line of code `res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` calls a function `func_2` with arguments `child`, `coord2`, and `used_coords`. The function `func_2` returns a value which is stored in the variable `res`.

Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. However, we know that `res` now holds the return value of `func_2`.

The initial state variables that are not affected by this line of code remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `child` is the first element in `childs`, `next_childs` is an empty list, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`**.
