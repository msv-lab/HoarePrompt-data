The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` converts `next_childs` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list, which is then assigned to `childs`. This means `childs` will contain only unique elements from `next_childs`.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is a list containing unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is a list containing all valid results from `func_2` for each `child` in `childs` that did not return 'found'. If `func_2` returned 'found' for any `child`, the loop would have exited early, returning `cur_depth + 1`.**
