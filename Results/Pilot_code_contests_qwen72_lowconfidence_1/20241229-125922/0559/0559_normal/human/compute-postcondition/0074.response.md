The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `coord1` and `coord2`. Both `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`).

The function returns different values based on various conditions:

- **Case_1**: The program returns 2.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, which is 2, where `cur_depth` was initially 1.
- **Case_3**: The program returns 2.
- **Case_4**: The program returns 3.
- **Case_5**: The program returns 3.
- **Case_6**: The program returns `cur_depth + 1`, where `cur_depth` is 2, so the program returns 3.
- **Case_7**: The program returns 4.
- **Case_8**: The program returns 4.
- **Case_9**: The program returns 4.
- **Case_10**: The program returns 0. The variables `cur_coord`, `coord1`, and `coord2` remain unchanged as tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`. `end_coord` remains `coord2`. `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search. `childs` is an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `coord1` and `coord2`, both tuples representing road square coordinates. It returns different integer values based on specific cases, ranging from 0 to 4, with additional context provided in Case_10 about the state of various variables.**
