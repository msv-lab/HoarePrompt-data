To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 2
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` must contain at least two elements
- `child` is the second element in `childs`
- `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`
- `next_childs` is updated to include `res`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `childs`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `childs` contains at least two elements.
   - `child` is the second element in `childs`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will move to the next element in `childs`.
   - The first element in `childs` will be processed in the current iteration, and the second element will be processed in the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `child` will be the third element in `childs` for the next iteration.
- The rest of the state remains unchanged because the loop only iterates over `childs` and does not modify other variables directly in the loop header.

### Final State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least three elements, `child` is the third element in `childs`, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`, `next_childs` is updated to include `res`**.
