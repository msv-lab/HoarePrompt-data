The code snippet `used_coords += childs` extends the list `used_coords` by appending all the elements from the list `childs`. This operation modifies the `used_coords` list, but does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is an empty list (`[]`).

However, since `childs` is appended to `used_coords` only once, the correct representation should be:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is an empty list (`[]`).**
