To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 3
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`
- `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`
- `next_childs` is `next_childs + res`
- `child` is the next element in `childs`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for child in childs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `childs`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `child` is the next element in `childs`.
   - `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- **`child`**: The next element in `childs` will be the new value of `child`.
- **`childs`**: The list `childs` remains the same, but the current `child` is removed from the list for the next iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `cur_coord` remains `coord1` (unchanged).
- `coord1` and `coord2` remain the same (unchanged).
- `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org` (unchanged).
- `end_coord` remains `coord2` (unchanged).
- `cur_depth` remains 3 (unchanged).
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs` (unchanged).
- `childs` remains the same list, but the current `child` is the next element in the list.
- `child` is the next element in `childs`.

### Final State:
State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `child` is the next element in `childs`**.
