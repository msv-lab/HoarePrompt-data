Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least one element, `next_childs` is a list containing the aggregated results of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for all `child` in `childs` where `res` is not 'found'. If any `res` is 'found', the program returns `cur_depth + 1`. If the loop does not execute, `next_childs` remains an empty list.**
