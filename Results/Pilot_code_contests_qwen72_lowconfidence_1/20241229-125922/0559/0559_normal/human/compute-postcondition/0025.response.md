The line of code `next_childs += res` appends the contents of `res` to the list `next_childs`. Given that `res` is not `'found'`, the value of `res` is added to `next_childs`.

Since `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and is not `'found'`, it implies `res` contains a list of coordinates or some form of iterable that can be appended to `next_childs`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 1, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`, `childs` is `graph[coord1]` and must be non-empty, `child` is the third element in `childs`, `next_childs` is `next_childs + res`, `res` is the result of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` and is not 'found'.**
