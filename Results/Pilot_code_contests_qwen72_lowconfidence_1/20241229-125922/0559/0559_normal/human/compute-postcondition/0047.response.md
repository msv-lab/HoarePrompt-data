The code snippet `next_childs += res` appends the value of `res` to the list `next_childs`. The value of `res` is determined by the function `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. Based on the initial state:

- If `res` is `'found'`, the program returns 3.
- If `res` is not `'found'`, `next_childs` is updated to include the value of `res`.

Given the initial state, `res` is the return value of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)`. The exact value of `res` is not specified, but it can either be `'found'` or some other value.

If `res` is `'found'`, the program returns 3, and the output state includes this return value.

If `res` is not `'found'`, `next_childs` is updated to include `res`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` must contain at least three elements, `child` is the third element in `childs`, `next_childs` is updated to include `res`. If `res` is 'found', the program returns 3.**
