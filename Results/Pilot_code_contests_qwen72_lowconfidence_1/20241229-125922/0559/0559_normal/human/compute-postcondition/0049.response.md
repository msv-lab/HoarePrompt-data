The code `childs = list(set(next_childs))` transforms `next_childs` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list, assigning this new list to `childs`.

- `next_childs` is initially a list containing the aggregated results of `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` for all `child` in `childs` where `res` is not 'found'.
- After the code executes, `childs` will contain the unique elements from `next_childs`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 2, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` remains as initially defined.**
