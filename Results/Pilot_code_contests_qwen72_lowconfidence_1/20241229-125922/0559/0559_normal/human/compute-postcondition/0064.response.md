The code `next_childs += res` appends the elements of `res` to the list `next_childs`. This operation modifies the value of `next_childs` by extending it with the elements from `res`.

- `cur_coord` remains `coord1`.
- `coord1` and `coord2` remain tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`).
- `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`.
- `end_coord` remains `coord2`.
- `cur_depth` remains 3.
- `used_coords` remains `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`.
- `childs` remains a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
- `next_childs` is updated to include the elements from `res`.
- `child` remains the next element in `childs`.
- If `res` == 'found', the program returns 4.

Since `res` is not specified as 'found', no return occurs.

Output State: **`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + childs`, `childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is `next_childs + res`, `child` is the next element in `childs`.**
