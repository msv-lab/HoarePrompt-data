The code snippet `childs = list(set(next_childs))` converts `next_childs` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list. This operation affects the `childs` variable, which now contains the unique elements from `next_childs`.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
- `end_coord` is `coord2`
- `cur_depth` is 3
- `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + final_childs`
- `final_childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`
- `next_childs` is the accumulated result of `res` for all iterations, and `res` is never 'found'

After executing the code:
- `childs` is a list containing the unique elements from `next_childs`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is 3, `used_coords` is `[coord1] + graph[coord1] + final_childs`, `final_childs` is a list of unique elements from `next_childs`, `next_childs` is the accumulated result of `res` for all iterations, `res` is never 'found', `childs` is a list containing the unique elements from `next_childs`.**
