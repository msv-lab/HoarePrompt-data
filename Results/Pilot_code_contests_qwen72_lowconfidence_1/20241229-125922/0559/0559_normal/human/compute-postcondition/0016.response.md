The code snippet `childs.append(child)` appends the value of `child` to the list `childs`.

- `jibun` is a valid key in `graph`.
- `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one more element.
- `target` is a tuple.
- `used_coords` is a set of tuples.
- `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`.
- If `child` is not in `used_coords`, `childs` is a list containing `child`.
- If `child` is equal to `target`, the program returns 'found'.
- `childs` was initially a list containing `child` (if `child` is not in `used_coords`).

After executing `childs.append(child)`, `child` is appended to the list `childs`, making it a list that now contains at least one `child`.

Output State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` must contain at least one more element, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, `child` is the next element in `graph[jibun]`, `childs` is a list containing `child`, if `child` is not in `used_coords` and `child` is equal to `target`, the program returns 'found'.**
