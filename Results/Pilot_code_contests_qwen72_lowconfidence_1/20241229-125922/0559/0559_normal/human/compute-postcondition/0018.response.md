Output State: **`jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` contains the neighbors of `jibun`, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, and `childs` is a list of all unique children of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If any `child` equals `target`, the program returns 'found' and does not complete the loop. If `graph[jibun]` is empty or all children are in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, `childs` remains an empty list.**
