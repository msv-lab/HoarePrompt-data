The function `func_1` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path between two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` on a grid. It accepts two parameters: `coord1` and `coord2`, both tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). The function returns an integer value representing the depth (number of steps) taken to find a path, or 0 if no path is found.
