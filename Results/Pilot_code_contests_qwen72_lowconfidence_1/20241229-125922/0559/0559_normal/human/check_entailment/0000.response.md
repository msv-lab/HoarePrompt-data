Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not fully address the problem as described. Specifically, the program lacks the necessary initialization and setup for the `depth_dict_org` and `graph` variables, which are crucial for the functions `func_1` and `func_2` to operate correctly. Additionally, the program does not handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. It does not read the maze dimensions and layout from standard input, nor does it compute the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
