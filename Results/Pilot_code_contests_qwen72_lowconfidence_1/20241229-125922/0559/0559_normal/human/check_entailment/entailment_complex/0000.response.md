Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly handle the scenario where the maze is completely connected but the BFS search does not find a path between two road squares because the target square is never reached. This can happen due to an issue in the BFS implementation within `func_1`.

### Issue in `func_1`:
1. **Return Value After BFS Loop**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `0` if the BFS loop completes without finding the target coordinate. This means that if the BFS search exhausts all possible paths without reaching the target, it incorrectly returns `0` instead of the correct distance.
   - According to the problem description, the program should find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make, and returning `0` in this case is incorrect.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
...
...
...
```
The correct output should be `4`, as the maximum distance between any two road squares is 4 moves. However, if the BFS search in `func_1` fails to find a path between two specific road squares, it will return `0`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix this issue, the BFS implementation should ensure that it correctly handles the case where the target square is not found. One way to do this is to initialize `cur_depth` to `-1` and update it only when a path is found. If the loop completes without finding the target, the function should return `-1` to indicate that no path was found, and then handle this appropriately in the main loop.

### Suggested Fix:
```python
def func_1(coord1, coord2):
    depth_dict = depth_dict_org.copy()
    cur_coord = coord1
    end_coord = coord2
    cur_depth = -1  # Initialize to -1 to indicate no path found
    used_coords = [coord1]
    childs = graph[coord1]
    while len(childs) != 0:
        cur_depth += 1
        next_childs = []
        used_coords += childs
        for child in childs:
            res = func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)
            if res == 'found':
                return cur_depth + 1
            next_childs += res
        childs = list(set(next_childs))
    return cur_depth  # Return -1 if no path is found
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the case where no path is found and return `-1`, which can be handled appropriately in the main loop to ensure the correct maximum distance is calculated.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the target square is not found, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
