You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi has a maze, which is a grid of H \times W squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns.

The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column is a "wall" square if S_{ij} is `#`, and a "road" square if S_{ij} is `.`.

From a road square, you can move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent road square.

You cannot move out of the maze, move to a wall square, or move diagonally.

Takahashi will choose a starting square and a goal square, which can be any road squares, and give the maze to Aoki.

Aoki will then travel from the starting square to the goal square, in the minimum number of moves required.

In this situation, find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make.

Constraints

* 1 \leq H,W \leq 20
* S_{ij} is `.` or `#`.
* S contains at least two occurrences of `.`.
* Any road square can be reached from any road square in zero or more moves.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step and consider the changes to the variables over multiple iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `cur_coord` is `coord1`
    #- `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`)
    #- `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`
    #- `end_coord` is `coord2`
    #- `cur_depth` is 0
    #- `used_coords` is `[coord1]`
    #- `childs` is `graph[coord1]`
    #
    #### Loop Execution:
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - `cur_depth` is incremented to 1.
    #   - `used_coords` is updated to `[coord1] + graph[coord1]`.
    #   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
    #   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
    #   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
    #   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
    #
    #2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    #   - `cur_depth` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
    #   - `used_coords` is extended with the current `childs`.
    #   - For each `child` in `childs`, `func_2(child, coord2, used_coords)` is called.
    #   - If `func_2` returns 'found', the loop exits and returns `cur_depth + 1`.
    #   - Otherwise, `next_childs` is populated with the results of `func_2` that are not 'found'.
    #   - `childs` is updated to a list of unique elements from `next_childs`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #The loop continues until `len(childs) == 0`, meaning there are no more unexplored children to process. At this point, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `cur_depth` will be the number of iterations the loop has executed.
    #- `used_coords` will contain all the coordinates that have been explored, starting from `coord1` and including all children explored in each iteration.
    #- `childs` will be an empty list, indicating no more unexplored children.
    #- If `func_2` ever returned 'found', the loop would have exited early, returning `cur_depth + 1`.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state is:
    #**`cur_coord` is `coord1`, `coord1` and `coord2` are tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`), `depth_dict` is a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`, `end_coord` is `coord2`, `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search, `childs` is an empty list.**
    return 0
    #The program returns 0. The variables `cur_coord`, `coord1`, and `coord2` remain unchanged as tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). `depth_dict` remains a shallow copy of `depth_dict_org`. `end_coord` remains `coord2`. `cur_depth` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. `used_coords` contains all coordinates explored during the search. `childs` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path between two coordinates `coord1` and `coord2` on a grid. It accepts two parameters: `coord1` and `coord2`, both tuples representing coordinates (i, j) where 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and both are road squares (i.e., S_{ij} is `.`). The function returns an integer value representing the depth (number of steps) taken to find a path, or 0 if no path is found.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: jibun and target are tuples representing coordinates (row, column) of road squares in the maze, used_coords is a set of tuples representing coordinates of road squares that have already been visited.
def func_2(jibun, target, used_coords):
    childs = []
    for child in graph[jibun]:
        if child == target:
            return 'found'
        
        if child not in used_coords:
            childs.append(child)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `jibun` is a valid key in `graph`, `graph[jibun]` contains the neighbors of `jibun`, `target` is a tuple, `used_coords` is a set of tuples, and `childs` is a list of all unique children of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If any `child` equals `target`, the program returns 'found' and does not complete the loop. If `graph[jibun]` is empty or all children are in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, `childs` remains an empty list.
    return childs
    #The program returns a list of all unique children of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If any child equals `target`, the program returns 'found'. If `graph[jibun]` is empty or all children are in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, the program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `jibun`, `target`, and `used_coords`. `jibun` and `target` are tuples representing coordinates, and `used_coords` is a set of tuples representing coordinates that have already been visited. The function returns 'found' if any neighbor of `jibun` matches the `target`. Otherwise, it returns a list of all unique neighbors of `jibun` that are not in `used_coords` and are not equal to `target`. If `jibun` has no neighbors, or all neighbors are either in `used_coords` or equal to `target`, the function returns an empty list. Edge cases include scenarios where `jibun` is not a valid key in `graph` (which would raise a KeyError), or if `graph[jibun]` is empty, leading to an immediate return of an empty list.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
