Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks several essential components to solve the problem correctly. Specifically:

1. **Graph Construction**: The code does not show how the graph is constructed from the input maze. Without this, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` cannot be executed correctly.

2. **Depth Dictionary Initialization**: The variable `depth_dict_org` is used but not defined anywhere in the code. This dictionary seems to be intended to store the depth of each coordinate, but its initialization is missing.

3. **Input Handling**: The code does not handle the input as described in the problem statement. It does not read the dimensions of the maze (H and W) or the maze itself (S).

4. **Main Logic**: The main logic to find the maximum possible number of moves is not implemented. The problem requires finding the maximum distance between any two road squares, but the provided functions only seem to handle a single path between two coordinates.

5. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases, such as when the maze has no valid paths or when the maze is very small.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
