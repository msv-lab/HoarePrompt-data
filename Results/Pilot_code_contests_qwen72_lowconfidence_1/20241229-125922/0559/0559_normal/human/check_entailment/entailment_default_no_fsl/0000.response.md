Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program is intended to find the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make to travel from any road square to any other road square in a maze, using the shortest path. However, the program has a few issues:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation**: The BFS implementation in `func_1` is not correctly handling the case where the target coordinate is the same as the current coordinate. Specifically, the function returns 0 if no path is found, but it should return 0 if the starting and ending coordinates are the same. This is because the distance from a point to itself is 0, not 1 as the current implementation suggests.

2. **Depth Calculation**: The function `func_1` increments the depth before checking if the target is found. This means that if the target is found immediately (i.e., the starting and ending coordinates are the same), the function will return 1 instead of 0.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the maze is such that the shortest path between two points is not unique. For example, if there are multiple paths of the same length between two points, the program should still correctly compute the maximum distance. However, the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the way it updates the depth.

To correct these issues, the BFS implementation should be adjusted to properly handle the case where the starting and ending coordinates are the same, and the depth should be incremented after checking if the target is found. Additionally, the program should ensure that it correctly handles all edge cases, including those where multiple paths of the same length exist.
