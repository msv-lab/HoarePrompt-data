Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number of moves Aoki has to make to travel from any starting road square to any goal road square in a maze. However, the program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to perform a BFS to find the shortest path between two points. However, the implementation is flawed. Specifically, the BFS is not properly implemented, and the function may not correctly explore all possible paths.
   - The `used_coords` list is used to keep track of visited nodes, but it is not initialized correctly. It should be a set for efficient lookups, and it should be cleared or reinitialized for each new BFS search.
   - The `cur_depth` is incremented outside the loop where it should be inside the loop to correctly count the number of moves.

2. **Handling of Multiple Starting and Goal Points**:
   - The program iterates over all pairs of road squares to find the maximum distance. This approach is correct in terms of the problem statement, but the BFS implementation within `func_1` is incorrect, leading to incorrect distances being calculated.

3. **Return Value of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `0` if it does not find a path, which is incorrect. It should return the maximum depth found during the BFS search.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the maze has only one road square, the program should return `0` because there are no moves to be made. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Perform a BFS from each road square to all other road squares to find the shortest path.
2. Track the maximum distance found during these BFS searches.
3. Return the maximum distance.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(meiro, start, h, w):
    queue = deque([start])
    dist = {start: 0}
    max_dist = 0
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < w and 0 <= ny < h and meiro[ny][nx] == '.' and (nx, ny) not in dist:
                dist[(nx, ny)] = dist[(x, y)] + 1
                max_dist = max(max_dist, dist[(nx, ny)])
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    
    return max_dist

h, w = map(int, input().split())
meiro = [list(input()) for _ in range(h)]
coords = [(x, y) for y in range(h) for x in range(w) if meiro[y][x] == '.']

max_distance = 0
for start in coords:
    max_distance = max(max_distance, bfs(meiro, start, h, w))

print(max_distance)
```

This corrected version uses a BFS to find the shortest path from each road square to all other road squares and keeps track of the maximum distance found. This ensures that the program correctly solves the problem as described.
