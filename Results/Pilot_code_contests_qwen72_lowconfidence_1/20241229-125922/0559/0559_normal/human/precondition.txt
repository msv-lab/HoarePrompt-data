coord1 and coord2 are tuples representing the coordinates of two road squares in the maze, where each coordinate is a pair of integers (i, j) such that 0 <= i < H and 0 <= j < W, and the maze is represented by a 2D list S of characters where S[i][j] is either `.` (a road square) or `#` (a wall square), with H and W being integers such that 1 <= H, W <= 20, and S contains at least two occurrences of `.`.
