The value of `d[a[j] - a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so the specific index in the list `d` that gets incremented is `d[a[2] - a[0]]`. Since `d[a[j] - a[0]]` was already 1 (as per the initial state), after this operation, `d[a[2] - a[0]]` will be 2. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, `d` is a list of 5000 zeros except `d[a[2] - a[0]]` which is now 2, `j` is 2**
