The provided code snippet involves printing the formatted value of `ans` to a precision of 10 decimal places. The value of `ans` is calculated based on a complex formula involving elements from lists `d` and `c`, and the variable `m`. However, the calculation of `ans` itself is not part of the given code snippet, which only focuses on printing the value of `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is the sum of \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\) and \(0 \leq j < i\) where `d[i]` and `d[j]` are not 0
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float

The code snippet does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It only prints the value of `ans` formatted to 10 decimal places.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the value of `ans` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\) and \(0 \leq j < i\) where `d[i]` and `d[j]` are not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, and the value of `ans` has been printed to 10 decimal places.**
