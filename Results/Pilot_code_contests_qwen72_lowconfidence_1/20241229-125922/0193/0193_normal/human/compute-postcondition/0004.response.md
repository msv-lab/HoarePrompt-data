To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000
   - `d` is a list of 5000 zeros
   - `i` is 0

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if there are values in the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
   - Given `i` is 0, the range will be from 1 to `n - 1`.

4. **Range Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i + 1` is 1, and the loop will run from 1 to `n - 1`).

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is already 0, which is correct for the loop to start.

6. **Final State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000.
   - `d` is a list of 5000 zeros.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, `d` is a list of 5000 zeros, `i` is 0**
