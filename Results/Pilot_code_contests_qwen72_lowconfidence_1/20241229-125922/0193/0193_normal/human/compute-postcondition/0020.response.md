To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \).
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `xrange(i + 1, n)`.
   - `i + 1` is the starting point of the range.
   - `n` is the upper bound (exclusive).

2. **Condition for Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if the range `xrange(i + 1, n)` is non-empty.
   - This means `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

3. **Given Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n`.

4. **Check the Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3.
   - Therefore, `3 < n`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The condition `3 < n` must be true for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 2000, the condition `3 < n` is satisfied as long as `n` is at least 4.

### Final State:
- `n` must be at least 4.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \), `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**
