To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[n] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `n`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range `(i + 1, n)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - The loop condition is `j in xrange(i + 1, n)`, which simplifies to `j in xrange(3, n)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition**:
   - At the start of the loop, `j` should be set to `i + 1`, which is 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `j` is set to 3 at the start of the first iteration.
   - The loop will execute if `j < n`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[n] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
