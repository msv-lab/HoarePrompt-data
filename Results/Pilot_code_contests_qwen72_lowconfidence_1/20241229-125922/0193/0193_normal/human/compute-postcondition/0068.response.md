To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change over the entire execution of the loop. Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
   - `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
   - `i` is 4999.
   - `ans` is 0.0.
   - `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `i = 4999` to `i = 1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
   - For each `i`, if `d[i]` is 0, the inner loop is skipped.
   - The inner loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = i-1` (inclusive).
   - For each `j`, `ans` is updated by adding \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\).

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be 0 (since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches 0).
   - `ans` will be the sum of \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\) and \(0 \leq j < i\) where `d[i]` and `d[j]` are not 0.
   - The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `c`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial values.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\) and \(0 \leq j < i\) where `d[i]` and `d[j]` are not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.**
