The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding a computed value to it. Let's break down the calculation and its impact on the program state.

1. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
   - `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
   - `i` is 4997.
   - `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4998\) plus \(\frac{d[4997]}{m} \times \frac{d[4998]}{m} \times \frac{c[4998]}{m}\).
   - `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
   ```
   - `d[i]` is `d[4997]`.
   - `d[j]` is `d[0]` because `j` is 0.
   - `c[i - j - 1]` is `c[4996]`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - The new term added to `ans` is:
     \[
     \text{new\_term} = \frac{d[4997]}{m} \times \frac{d[0]}{m} \times \frac{c[4996]}{m}
     \]
   - This term is added to the existing value of `ans`.

4. **Updated State:**
   - The value of `ans` is updated to:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \text{original\_ans} + \frac{d[4997]}{m} \times \frac{d[0]}{m} \times \frac{c[4996]}{m}
     \]
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `c`, `i`, `m`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4997, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus \(\frac{d[4997]}{m} \times \frac{d[0]}{m} \times \frac{c[4996]}{m}\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 0**.
