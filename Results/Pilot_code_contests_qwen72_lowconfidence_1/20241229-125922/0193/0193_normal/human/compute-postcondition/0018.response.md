To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop as it iterates through all valid indices of the list `a`. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers initialized such that the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \).
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 1` and runs until `j < n`.
   - For each iteration, the difference \( a[j] - a[i] \) is computed, and the corresponding index in `d` is incremented by 1.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `d` is modified by incrementing the value at the index \( a[j] - a[i] \) for each \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \).
   - `i` remains 1 throughout the loop.
   - `j` starts at `i + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `d` will have been updated for all valid differences \( a[j] - a[i] \) where \( j \) ranges from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \).
- The value at index \( k \) in `d` will be the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \).

### Summary:
- `n` remains an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \).
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` will be `n` after the loop completes.

### Output State:
**Output State: `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \), `i` is 1, `j` is `n`.**
