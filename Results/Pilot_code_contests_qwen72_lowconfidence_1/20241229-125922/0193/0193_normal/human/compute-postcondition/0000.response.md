The value of `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through `raw_input()`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000. After executing the code, `n` holds the new integer value provided by the user, which should still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The list `ai` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000 (updated to the user's input), `ai` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, with all ai being distinct.**
