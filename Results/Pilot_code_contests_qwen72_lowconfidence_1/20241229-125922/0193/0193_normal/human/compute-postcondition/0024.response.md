To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Initial Conditions:
- `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[3] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` (which is now 4) must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 2 (since the loop is iterating over `j` and `i` is not modified within the loop).
- `j` is now 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[3] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
