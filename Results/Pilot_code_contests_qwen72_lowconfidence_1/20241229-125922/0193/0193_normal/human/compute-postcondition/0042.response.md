The given Python code snippet updates the variable `ans` using the values from the lists `d`, `c`, and the scalar `m`. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
   - `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
   - `i` is 4999.
   - `ans` is 0.0.
   - `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The expression `d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)` is evaluated and added to `ans`.

3. **Calculations:**
   - `i` is 4999, `j` is 0.
   - `c[i - j - 1]` is `c[4998]`, which is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[4998]`.
   - `d[i]` is `d[4999]`.
   - `d[j]` is `d[0]`.
   - `m` is the sum of all elements in `d`.

4. **Update `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + (d[4999] / m) * (d[0] / m) * (c[4998] / m)`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `d` remains a list of 5000 integers.
   - `c` remains a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
   - `i` remains 4999.
   - `ans` is now `0.0 + (d[4999] / m) * (d[0] / m) * (c[4998] / m)`.
   - `m` remains the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
   - `j` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999, `ans` is \((d[4999] / m) * (d[0] / m) * (c[4998] / m)\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 0**.
