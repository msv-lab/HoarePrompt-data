To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the final state of the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 zeros.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \). Since `i` is 0, the loop runs from 1 to \( n - 1 \). This means the loop will execute \( n - 1 \) times.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - For each iteration of the loop, the value `d[a[j] - a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - Specifically, for each \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), the difference \( a[j] - a[0] \) is calculated, and the corresponding index in `d` is incremented.

3. **Final State of Variables**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was initially.
   - `a` remains the same as it was initially (a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)).
   - `d` will have non-zero values at indices corresponding to the differences \( a[j] - a[0] \) for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \). Each such index will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the difference.
   - `i` remains 0.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \).
- `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), `i` is 0.**
