The value at index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` is incremented by 1. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, the index in `d` that is incremented is `a[4] - a[2]`. The value at this index was already incremented once, so it is now incremented again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[3] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1 and the value at index \( a[4] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**.
