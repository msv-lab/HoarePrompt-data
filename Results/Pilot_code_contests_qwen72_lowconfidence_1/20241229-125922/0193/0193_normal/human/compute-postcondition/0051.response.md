To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run based on the given state and the loop statement.

Given state:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`
- `i` is 4998
- `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float
- `j` is 4998
- If `d[4998]` is 0, the program state remains unchanged

Loop statement:
```
for j in xrange(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in xrange(i)` will execute if `i` is greater than 0. Given that `i` is 4998, the loop will execute because 4998 > 0.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The loop variable `j` will start from 0 and iterate up to `i-1` (which is 4997 in this case).

3. **Program State Adjustments**:
   - `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. This is already satisfied since `i` is 4998.
   - `j` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4998, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 0**.
