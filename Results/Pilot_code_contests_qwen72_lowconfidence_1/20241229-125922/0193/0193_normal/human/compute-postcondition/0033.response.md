To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[1] = d[1]` and `c[2] = d[1] + d[2]` and the rest are zeros.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, 5000):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to 4999 (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 5000.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `c`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop counter `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[1] = d[1]` and `c[2] = d[1] + d[2]` and the rest are zeros, `i` is 3**
