Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000`. It then calculates the probability distribution of differences between pairs of elements in `a` and uses this distribution to compute a specific expected value. The final result, which is a floating-point number representing this expected value, is printed with 10 decimal places. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the original input values `n` and `a`, and the computed expected value is printed to the console. **

### Key Points:
- **Input**: The function reads `n` and `a` from user input.
- **Output**: The function prints a floating-point number representing the computed expected value.
- **State After Execution**:
  - `n` remains an integer where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2000`.
  - `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers where `1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000`.
  - The computed expected value is printed to the console.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case 1**: If `n` is 2, the function will still execute correctly, but the number of pairs `(i, j)` will be minimal, affecting the computation of `d` and `c`.
- **Edge Case 2**: If all elements in `a` are very close to each other, the differences might be small, leading to a concentrated distribution in `d`.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer inputs or out-of-bound values). It assumes the input is always valid according to the specified constraints.
