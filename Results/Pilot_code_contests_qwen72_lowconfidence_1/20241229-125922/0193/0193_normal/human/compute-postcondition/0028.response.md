The code initializes a new list `c` with 5000 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `d`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) is the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) for all \( 0 \leq i < j < n \), `c` is a list of 5000 zeros.**
