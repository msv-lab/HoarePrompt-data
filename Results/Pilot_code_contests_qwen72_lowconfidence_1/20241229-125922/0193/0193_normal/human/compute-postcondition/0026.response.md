To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to consider the initial conditions and how the loop modifies the variables over time.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \)
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
    d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` starts at `i + 1`, which is 3
   - The loop runs until `j` reaches `n - 1` (since `range(i + 1, n)` is exclusive of `n`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, the value at index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop iterates from `j = 3` to `j = n - 1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `j` will have been incremented from 3 to `n - 1`.
   - The value at index `a[j] - a[i]` in `d` will be incremented for each `j` from 3 to `n - 1`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[j] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 3 to `n - 1`.
- `i` remains 2
- `j` is `n` (but the loop only runs up to `n - 1`)

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
**`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[j] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 3 to `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**
