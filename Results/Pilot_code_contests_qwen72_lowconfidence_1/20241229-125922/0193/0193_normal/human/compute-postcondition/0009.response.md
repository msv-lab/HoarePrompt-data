The code snippet `d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1` updates the list `d` by incrementing the value at the index `a[j] - a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, we know:

- `n` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 5000 \).
- `d` is a list of 5000 zeros, except `d[a[2] - a[0]]` which is now 2.
- `j` is 3.

The calculation for the index in `d` is `a[j] - a[i]`, which translates to `a[3] - a[0]`.

Therefore, the value at `d[a[3] - a[0]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 5000 \), `d` remains a list of 5000 zeros, except `d[a[2] - a[0]]` which is now 2 and `d[a[3] - a[0]]` which is now 1, `j` is 3.**
