To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4999.
- `ans` is 0.0.
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
- If `d[i]` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop if this is the last iteration.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in xrange(i)` will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`. Since `i` is 4999, the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = 4998`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 4999.
   - `j` is 0 (since the loop starts with `j = 0`).

3. **Dependencies**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `j` is 0, which is within the range of `xrange(i)`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `i` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- Initialize `j` to 0.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The initial state should be:
- `i` is 4999 (which is already given).
- `j` is 0 (initial value for the loop).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999, `ans` is 0.0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 0**.
