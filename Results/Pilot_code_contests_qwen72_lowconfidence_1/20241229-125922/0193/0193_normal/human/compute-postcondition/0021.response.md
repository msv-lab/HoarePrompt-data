The code snippet updates the list `d` based on the difference between the elements `a[j]` and `a[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) appears for \( j \) from \( i + 1 \) to \( n - 1 \)
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`

The code snippet `d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1` increments the value at index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` by 1.

Let's calculate the specific index and update `d` accordingly:

1. `a[j]` is `a[n]` because `j` is `n`.
2. `a[i]` is `a[2]` because `i` is 2.
3. The difference `a[n] - a[2]` is calculated.
4. The value at index `a[n] - a[2]` in the list `d` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[n] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[n] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**
