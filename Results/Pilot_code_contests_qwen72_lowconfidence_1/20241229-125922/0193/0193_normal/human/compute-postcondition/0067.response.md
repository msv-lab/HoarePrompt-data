Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4997, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of \(\frac{d[4997]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[4997 - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4997\) where `d[j]` is not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4997.**
