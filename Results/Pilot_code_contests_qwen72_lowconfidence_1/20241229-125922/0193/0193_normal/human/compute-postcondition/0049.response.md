The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since this statement is not within a loop context in the given code snippet, it would typically be invalid in a real program. However, assuming this is part of a larger context where there is a loop, the `continue` statement will only affect the flow control and not the values of the variables.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program state is:

- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`
- `i` is 4998
- `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float
- `j` is 4998

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4998, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4998**
