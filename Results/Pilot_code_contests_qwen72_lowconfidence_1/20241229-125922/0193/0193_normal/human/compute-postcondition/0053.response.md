To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop condition and how the variables change from one iteration to the next.

Given:
- The loop condition is `for j in xrange(i)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4998 and `j` is 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. Since `i` is 4998, the loop will execute until `j` reaches 4998.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 4998.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `c`, `ans`, `m`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4998, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[0]}{m} * \frac{c[4997]}{m}\right)\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 1**
