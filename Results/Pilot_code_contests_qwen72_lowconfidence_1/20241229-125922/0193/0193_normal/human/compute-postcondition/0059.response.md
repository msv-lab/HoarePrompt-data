The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the given code snippet, it's assumed that this `continue` is part of a larger loop structure that is not shown. Without the loop context, the direct impact of `continue` is not fully determinable beyond the immediate instruction to skip the rest of the current loop body.

Since the `continue` statement does not change any variable values directly, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the implied control flow change. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4997, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4998\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4998.**
