The code snippet increments the value at the index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` by 1. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[n] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

The specific value of `a[j] - a[i]` is calculated as `a[3] - a[2]`. The value at this index in `d` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where \(4 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( a[3] - a[2] \) is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
