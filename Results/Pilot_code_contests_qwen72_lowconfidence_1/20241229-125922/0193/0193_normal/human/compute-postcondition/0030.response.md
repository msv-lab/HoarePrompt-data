The code snippet updates the value of `c[i]` based on the current and previous values in the `c` list and the corresponding value in the `d` list. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 zeros
- `i` is 1

The code `c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]` updates the second element of the list `c` (since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0) by adding the value of `d[1]` to the first element of `c` (which is 0).

Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `c[1]` is `d[1]`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[1] = d[1]` and the rest are zeros
- `i` is 1

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[1] = d[1]` and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**
