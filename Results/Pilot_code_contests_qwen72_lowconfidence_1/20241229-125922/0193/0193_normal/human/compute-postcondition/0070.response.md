The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it accepts two parameters: `n` and `ai`.

- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000.
- `ai` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, and all elements in `ai` are distinct.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot accurately describe what the function returns without additional details. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it might perform some operation using `n` and the list `ai` and return a result based on that operation.

Given the lack of specific output information, here's the best description of the function's functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, and a list `ai` of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000. The function performs an unspecified operation using these parameters and returns a result based on that operation.**
