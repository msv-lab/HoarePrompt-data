To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4999.
- `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0.
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
- `j` is 4998.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i` is greater than 0. The loop starts at `i = 4999` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4999.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be 4998.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` needs to be updated to 4998.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0, so no other conditions need to change.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4998, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4998**
