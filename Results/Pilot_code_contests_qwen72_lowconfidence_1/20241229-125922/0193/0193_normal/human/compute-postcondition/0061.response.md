To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`
- `i` is 4997
- `ans` is a complex expression involving `d` and `c`
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float
- `j` is 4998

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in xrange(i)` will iterate from `0` to `i-1` (inclusive).
- Given that `i` is 4997, the loop will iterate from `0` to `4996`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0.
- Since `i` is 4997, which is greater than 0, the loop will definitely execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The initial state already ensures that `i` is 4997, which is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- The variable `j` is initialized by the loop itself and will start from 0, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.

### Final State:
The loop will execute because `i` is 4997, and `j` will start from 0. Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4997, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4998\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4998. If `d[4997]` is 0, no changes are made to `ans`.**
