The code snippet `d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1` updates the list `d` by incrementing the value at the index `a[j] - a[i]` by 1. Here's the detailed analysis:

- The index `a[j] - a[i]` is calculated using the elements of the list `a`.
- The value at this index in the list `d` is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000.
- `d` is a list of 5000 zeros.

The specific value of `j` is not provided, but assuming `j` is within the bounds of the list `a` (i.e., 0 ≤ j < n), the value at the index `a[j] - a[i]` in `d` is incremented by 1.

Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `d[a[j] - a[0]] += 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, `d` is a list of 5000 zeros except `d[a[j] - a[0]]` which is now 1.**
