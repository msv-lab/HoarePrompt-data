### Analysis of the Loop

Given the loop code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n):
        d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
```

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 zeros

### Loop Execution:
1. **Outer Loop (`i` loop)**:
   - The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
   - For each value of `i`, the inner loop runs.

2. **Inner Loop (`j` loop)**:
   - The inner loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = n - 1`.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, the value at index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` is incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- **Variable `n`**: Remains unchanged as it is a constant.
- **Variable `a`**: Remains unchanged as it is a list of distinct integers.
- **Variable `d`**: The list `d` will be modified such that each element `d[k]` (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) represents the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `a[j] - a[i] = k`.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **For each `i` from 0 to `n - 1`**:
  - The inner loop iterates over all `j` from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
  - For each pair `(i, j)`, the difference `a[j] - a[i]` is computed.
  - The corresponding index in `d` (i.e., `a[j] - a[i]`) is incremented by 1.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n = 4` and `a = [1, 3, 5, 7]`:
  - For `i = 0`:
    - `j = 1`: `a[1] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2` → `d[2] += 1`
    - `j = 2`: `a[2] - a[0] = 5 - 1 = 4` → `d[4] += 1`
    - `j = 3`: `a[3] - a[0] = 7 - 1 = 6` → `d[6] += 1`
  - For `i = 1`:
    - `j = 2`: `a[2] - a[1] = 5 - 3 = 2` → `d[2] += 1`
    - `j = 3`: `a[3] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4` → `d[4] += 1`
  - For `i = 2`:
    - `j = 3`: `a[3] - a[2] = 7 - 5 = 2` → `d[2] += 1`

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) is the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) for all \( 0 \leq i < j < n \).

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) is the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) for all \( 0 \leq i < j < n \).**
