To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 < n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), plus 1 at index \( a[2] - a[1] \).
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.
- The loop will execute one more time if `j` (which is now 3) is less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3 and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 < n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), plus 1 at index \( a[2] - a[1] \), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
