To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4999.
- `ans` is 0.0.
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop uses `xrange(4999, 0, -1)`, which means `i` will start at 4999 and decrement by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be within the range specified by `xrange(4999, 0, -1)`, which is from 4999 down to 1.

### States to Adjust:
- The variable `i` must be set to 4999 for the loop to start.
- The list `d` must have at least 5000 elements for the loop to access `d[1]` to `d[4999]`.
- The list `c` must have at least 5000 elements for the loop to access `c[1]` to `c[4999]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999, `ans` is 0.0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.**
