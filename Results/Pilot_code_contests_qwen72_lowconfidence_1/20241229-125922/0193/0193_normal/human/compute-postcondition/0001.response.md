The code snippet `a = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, and then maps each element to an integer, storing the result in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000 (this value is determined by the user's input).
- `ai` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, with all ai being distinct.

After executing the code:
- `a` now holds a list of integers converted from the input provided by the user.
- The length of `a` should be equal to `n` because the input is expected to contain `n` integers.
- The integers in `a` should be within the range 1 to 5000, and all should be distinct, as per the precondition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, `ai` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, with all ai being distinct.**
