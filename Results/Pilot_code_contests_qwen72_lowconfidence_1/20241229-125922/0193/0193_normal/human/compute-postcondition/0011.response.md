To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in xrange(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \).
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

Given that `i` is currently 0, for the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- The loop will execute if `i < n`, which means `1 < n` or `n > 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), `i` is 1.**
