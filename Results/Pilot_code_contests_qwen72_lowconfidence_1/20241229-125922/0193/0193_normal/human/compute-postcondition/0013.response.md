The code snippet `d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[j] - a[i]` in the list `d` by 1.

- `a[j] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the elements at indices `j` and `i` in the list `a`.
- Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the difference is `a[2] - a[1]`.
- This difference is used as the index in the list `d` to increment its value by 1.

Therefore, the value at index `a[2] - a[1]` in the list `d` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 < n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 4999 \)) is the number of times the difference \( a[j] - a[0] = k \) appears for \( j \) from 1 to \( n - 1 \), plus 1 at index \( a[2] - a[1] \), `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
