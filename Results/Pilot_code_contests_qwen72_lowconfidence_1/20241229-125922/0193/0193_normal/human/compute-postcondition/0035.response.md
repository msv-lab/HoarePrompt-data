To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided initial state and intermediate output states.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) is the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) for all \( 0 \leq i < j < n \).
- `c` is a list of 5000 zeros.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(1, 5000):
    c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = 4999` (since `xrange(1, 5000)` generates numbers from 1 to 4999).
- For each iteration, `c[i]` is updated to be the sum of `c[i - 1]` and `d[i]`.

### Intermediate States:
- After 1 iteration: `c[1] = d[1]`, `c[2]` to `c[4999]` are still zero.
- After 2 iterations: `c[1] = d[1]`, `c[2] = d[1] + d[2]`, `c[3]` to `c[4999]` are still zero.
- After 3 iterations: `c[1] = d[1]`, `c[2] = d[1] + d[2]`, `c[3] = d[1] + d[2] + d[3]`, `c[4]` to `c[4999]` are still zero.

### Final State:
- After 4999 iterations (which is the full range of the loop):
  - `c[1] = d[1]`
  - `c[2] = d[1] + d[2]`
  - `c[3] = d[1] + d[2] + d[3]`
  - ...
  - `c[4999] = d[1] + d[2] + ... + d[4999]`
  - `c[0]` remains 0 (since the loop starts from `i = 1`).

### Conclusion:
The loop will always execute 4999 times because the range is fixed from 1 to 4999. The final state of the variables will be:

- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where:
  - `c[0]` is 0.
  - For \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4999 (the last value of `i` after the loop completes).

### Output State:
**`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999.**
