To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and then generalize the result.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4998.
- `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0.
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
- `j` is 4998.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i):
    ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 4998.
   - `j` starts at 0 and goes up to 4997 (since `range(i)` is `range(4998)`).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from 0 to 4997, the loop updates `ans` by adding the value \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\).

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - After the loop finishes, `ans` will be the sum of all such terms for \(j\) from 0 to 4997.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \sum_{j=0}^{4997} \left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)
     \]
   - This is in addition to the initial value of `ans` which was the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` remains a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` remains a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` remains a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` remains 4998.
- `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4998\).
- `m` remains the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
- `j` is 4998 (unchanged because the loop variable `j` is local to the loop).

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4998, `ans` is the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4999 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4999\) where `d[j]` is not 0 plus the sum of \(\left(\frac{d[4998]}{m} * \frac{d[j]}{m} * \frac{c[4998 - j - 1]}{m}\right)\) for all \(0 \leq j < 4998\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 4998.**
