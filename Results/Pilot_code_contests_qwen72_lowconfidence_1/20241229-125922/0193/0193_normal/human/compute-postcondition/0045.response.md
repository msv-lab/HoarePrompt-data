To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
- `d` is a list of 5000 integers.
- `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`.
- `i` is 4999.
- `ans` is \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[0]}{m} * \frac{c[4998]}{m}\right) + \left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[1]}{m} * \frac{c[4997]}{m}\right)\).
- `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in xrange(i):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1` (exclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and the new value of `j` must still be less than `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `j` by 1: `j` becomes 2.
- The loop condition `j < i` must still hold true. Since `i` is 4999, `j` being 2 is less than 4999, so the loop will execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999, `ans` is \(\left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[0]}{m} * \frac{c[4998]}{m}\right) + \left(\frac{d[4999]}{m} * \frac{d[1]}{m} * \frac{c[4997]}{m}\right)\), `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float, `j` is 2**
