The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000`. It then calculates the probability distribution of differences between pairs of elements in `a` and uses this distribution to compute a specific expected value. The final result, which is a floating-point number representing this expected value, is printed with 10 decimal places. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the original input values `n` and `a`, and the computed expected value is printed to the console.
