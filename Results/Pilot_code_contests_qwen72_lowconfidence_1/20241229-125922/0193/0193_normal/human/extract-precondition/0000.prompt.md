You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing n balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.

Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of balls in the jar.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000) — the number written on the ith ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same number.

Output

Print a single real value — the probability that Jerry has a higher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

0.0000000000


Input

3
1 2 10


Output

0.0740740741

Note

In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4, so Jerry never has a higher total.

In the second case, each game could've had three outcomes — 10 - 2, 10 - 1, or 2 - 1. Jerry has a higher total if and only if Andrew won 2 - 1 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the 10 in the last round. This has probability <image>.
