You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing n balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.

Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of balls in the jar.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000) — the number written on the ith ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same number.

Output

Print a single real value — the probability that Jerry has a higher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

0.0000000000


Input

3
1 2 10


Output

0.0740740741

Note

In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4, so Jerry never has a higher total.

In the second case, each game could've had three outcomes — 10 - 2, 10 - 1, or 2 - 1. Jerry has a higher total if and only if Andrew won 2 - 1 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the 10 in the last round. This has probability <image>.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
    c = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(1, 5000):
        c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]
    (ans, m) = (0.0, float(sum(d)))
    for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
        if d[i] == 0:
            continue
        for j in xrange(i):
            ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
    print('{0:.10f}'.format(ans))


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000`. It then calculates the probability distribution of differences between pairs of elements in `a` and uses this distribution to compute a specific expected value. The final result, which is a floating-point number representing this expected value, is printed with 10 decimal places. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the original input values `n` and `a`, and the computed expected value is printed to the console.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
