You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing n balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.

Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of balls in the jar.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000) — the number written on the ith ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same number.

Output

Print a single real value — the probability that Jerry has a higher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

0.0000000000


Input

3
1 2 10


Output

0.0740740741

Note

In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4, so Jerry never has a higher total.

In the second case, each game could've had three outcomes — 10 - 2, 10 - 1, or 2 - 1. Jerry has a higher total if and only if Andrew won 2 - 1 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the 10 in the last round. This has probability <image>.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
    c = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(1, 5000):
        c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]
    (ans, m) = (0.0, float(sum(d)))
    for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
        if d[i] == 0:
            continue
        for j in xrange(i):
            ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
    print('{0:.10f}'.format(ans))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the numbers on the balls can be large, up to 5000, and the differences between these numbers might also be large. The arrays `d` and `c` are fixed at a size of 5000, which means if the differences between the numbers on the balls exceed 5000, the program will result in an index out of bounds error. This is a critical flaw because the problem statement guarantees that the numbers on the balls can be up to 5000, but it does not guarantee that the differences between these numbers will always fit within the first 5000 integers.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 5000 10000
```
Here, the differences between the numbers can be 4999, 9999, and 5000. The array `d` will not be able to store the difference 9999, leading to an out-of-bounds error.

This case demonstrates that the program does not work correctly for all possible inputs, thus the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2000, and ai is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000, with all ai being distinct.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers where the value at index \( k \) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 4999\)) is the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that \( a[j] - a[i] = k \) for all \( 0 \leq i < j < n \).
    c = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(1, 5000):
        c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 4999.
    ans, m = 0.0, float(sum(d))
    for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
        if d[i] == 0:
            continue
        
        for j in xrange(i):
            ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `d` is a list of 5000 integers, `c` is a list of 5000 elements where `c[0]` is 0 and for \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\), `c[i]` is the cumulative sum of `d` from `d[1]` to `d[i]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the sum of \(\frac{d[i]}{m} \times \frac{d[j]}{m} \times \frac{c[i - j - 1]}{m}\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq 4999\) and \(0 \leq j < i\) where `d[i]` and `d[j]` are not 0, `m` is the sum of all elements in `d` as a float.
    print('{0:.10f}'.format(ans))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000`. It then calculates the probability distribution of differences between pairs of elements in `a` and uses this distribution to compute a specific expected value. The final result, which is a floating-point number representing this expected value, is printed with 10 decimal places. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the original input values `n` and `a`, and the computed expected value is printed to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
