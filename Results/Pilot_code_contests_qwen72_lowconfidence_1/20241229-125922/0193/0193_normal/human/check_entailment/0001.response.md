Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the numbers on the balls can be large, up to 5000, and the differences between these numbers might also be large. The arrays `d` and `c` are fixed at a size of 5000, which means if the differences between the numbers on the balls exceed 5000, the program will result in an index out of bounds error. This is a critical flaw because the problem statement guarantees that the numbers on the balls can be up to 5000, but it does not guarantee that the differences between these numbers will always fit within the first 5000 integers.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
1 5000 10000
```
Here, the differences between the numbers can be 4999, 9999, and 5000. The array `d` will not be able to store the difference 9999, leading to an out-of-bounds error.

This case demonstrates that the program does not work correctly for all possible inputs, thus the correctness is **False**.
