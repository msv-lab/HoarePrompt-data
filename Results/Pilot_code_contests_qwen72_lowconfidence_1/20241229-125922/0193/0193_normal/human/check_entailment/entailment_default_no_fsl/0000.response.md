Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code attempts to calculate the probability distribution of differences between pairs of elements in the list `a` and uses this distribution to compute an expected value. However, the problem requires calculating the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third round.

The code's approach to calculating the probability using differences between pairs of elements does not align with the problem's requirement to consider the sums of the balls drawn over three rounds. The logic in the code does not account for the specific sequence of wins and the sums of the balls drawn by each player over the three rounds.

To illustrate a specific case where the code fails:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  3
  1 2 10
  ```
  According to the problem, the correct output should be `0.0740740741` because the only way Jerry can have a higher total is if Andrew wins the first two rounds with the smallest difference (2 - 1) and Jerry wins the third round with the largest ball (10). However, the provided code does not correctly compute this probability and would likely produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
