Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The problem requires calculating the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third.
   - The provided program calculates the expected value of a certain expression involving differences between pairs of elements in the list `a`. However, this does not directly correspond to the required probability.

2. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program constructs a difference array `d` where `d[k]` represents the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `a[j] - a[i] = k`.
   - It then calculates a cumulative sum array `c` from `d`.
   - Finally, it computes a value `ans` using these arrays, but the formula used to compute `ans` does not align with the problem's requirement to find the probability of Jerry's sum being higher than Andrew's sum under the given conditions.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The program prints the computed value `ans` with 10 decimal places, but this value is not the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Generate all possible outcomes of the three rounds.
2. Filter the outcomes where Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third.
3. Calculate the sums of the balls drawn by Andrew and Jerry in these filtered outcomes.
4. Count the number of outcomes where Jerry's sum is strictly higher than Andrew's sum.
5. Compute the probability as the ratio of the count of favorable outcomes to the total number of filtered outcomes.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
