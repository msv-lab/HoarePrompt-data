You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game consists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly without replacement from a jar containing n balls, each labeled with a distinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry, who awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the balls to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of the three rounds.

Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so Andrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming that he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total. What is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly higher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew?

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of balls in the jar.

The second line contains n integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 5000) — the number written on the ith ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same number.

Output

Print a single real value — the probability that Jerry has a higher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the third. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. 

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if <image>.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

0.0000000000


Input

3
1 2 10


Output

0.0740740741

Note

In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first two rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and vice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4, so Jerry never has a higher total.

In the second case, each game could've had three outcomes — 10 - 2, 10 - 1, or 2 - 1. Jerry has a higher total if and only if Andrew won 2 - 1 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the 10 in the last round. This has probability <image>.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = map(int, raw_input().split())
    d = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(n):
        for j in xrange(i + 1, n):
            d[a[j] - a[i]] += 1
    c = [0] * 5000
    for i in xrange(1, 5000):
        c[i] = c[i - 1] + d[i]
    (ans, m) = (0.0, float(sum(d)))
    for i in xrange(4999, 0, -1):
        if d[i] == 0:
            continue
        for j in xrange(i):
            ans += d[i] / m * (d[j] / m) * (c[i - j - 1] / m)
    print('{0:.10f}'.format(ans))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
