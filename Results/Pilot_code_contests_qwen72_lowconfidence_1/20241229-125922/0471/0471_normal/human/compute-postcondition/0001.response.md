The code snippet provided will read a line of input from the user and split it into parts based on spaces, then convert each part into an integer, and finally store these integers in the list `a`.

- The variable `n` is initially a string representing user input, but it is not used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, its value does not affect the execution of the given code.
- The variable `a` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input.

Since the exact content of the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the integers in the list `a`. However, we know that `a` will now contain integers converted from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input**
