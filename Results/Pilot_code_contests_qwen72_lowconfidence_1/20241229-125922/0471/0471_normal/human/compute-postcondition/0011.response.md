The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The value of `ans` is printed, but the variables `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.**
