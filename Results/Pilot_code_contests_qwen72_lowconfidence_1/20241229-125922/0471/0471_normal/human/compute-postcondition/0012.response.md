The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The integer `n` represents the number of questions in a test, and it must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains integers where each element represents the number of answer variants for each question, and each element must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ ai ≤ 109.

The function returns the total number of different ways to answer all the questions in the test, considering the number of answer variants for each question.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), and returns the total number of different ways to answer all the questions in the test.**
