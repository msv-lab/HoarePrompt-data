Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then calculates the total number of different ways to answer all the questions in the test, where each question `i` has `a[i]` possible answers. The result is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `a` are consumed, and the calculated total number of different ways to answer the questions is printed. Edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or out-of-bound integers, which are not handled by the function. **
