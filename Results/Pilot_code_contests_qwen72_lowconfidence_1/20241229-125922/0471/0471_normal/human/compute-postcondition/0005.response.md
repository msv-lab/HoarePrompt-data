The code snippet `ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a` since `i` is 1.
2. `(a[i] - 1)` calculates the value of the second element of `a` minus 1.
3. `(a[i] - 1) * i` multiplies the result of step 2 by `i`, which is 1, so this is simply `a[1] - 1`.
4. `1 + (a[1] - 1) * 1` simplifies to `1 + a[1] - 1`, which further simplifies to `a[1]`.

Since `ans` initially is 0, the new value of `ans` is `0 + a[1]`, which is simply `a[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is `a[1]`, `i` is 1**
