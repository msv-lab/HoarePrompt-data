The code `ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` updates the value of `ans` by adding `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` to its current value. Let's break down the changes:

- `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `a` is a list of integers with `0` prepended to the beginning.
- `ans` was initially set to `a[1]`.
- `i` is currently 2.

The expression `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` is evaluated as follows:
- `a[i]` refers to the third element in the list `a` (since `i` is 2).
- `(a[i] - 1) * i` calculates the difference between `a[i]` and 1, multiplies it by `i`, which is 2.
- `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` adds 1 to the result of the multiplication.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is:
- `ans = a[1] + 1 + (a[2] - 1) * 2`

The final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is `a[1] + 1 + (a[2] - 1) * 2`, `i` is 2**
