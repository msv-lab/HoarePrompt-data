The code snippet `a = [0] + a` modifies the list `a` by prepending a `0` to the beginning of the list. The variable `n` remains unchanged as a string representing user input.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning**
