The value of `ans` is updated by adding `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `1 + (a[3] - 1) * 3`. The initial value of `ans` is `a[1] + 1 + (a[2] - 1) * 2`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `a[1] + 1 + (a[2] - 1) * 2 + 1 + (a[3] - 1) * 3`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is `a[1] + 1 + (a[2] - 1) * 2 + 1 + (a[3] - 1) * 3`, `i` is 3**
