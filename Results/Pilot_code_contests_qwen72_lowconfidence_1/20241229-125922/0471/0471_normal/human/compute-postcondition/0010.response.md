To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a string representing user input.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i`.

2. **Update Rule**:
   - In each iteration, `ans` is incremented by `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - After `n` iterations, `ans` will be the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Final Output State:
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0.
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times, and `ans` will be the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Formulating the Final Output State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning.
- `ans` is the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.**
