#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of questions in the test, and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) where each element represents the number of answer variants for each question.
def func():
    n = input()
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    a = [0] + a
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with `0` prepended to the beginning, `ans` is the sum of `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then calculates the total number of different ways to answer all the questions in the test, where each question `i` has `a[i]` possible answers. The result is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `a` are consumed, and the calculated total number of different ways to answer the questions is printed. Edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or out-of-bound integers, which are not handled by the function.
