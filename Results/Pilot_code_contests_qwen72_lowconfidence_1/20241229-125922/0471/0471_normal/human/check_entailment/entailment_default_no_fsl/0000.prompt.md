You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The average miner Vaganych took refresher courses. As soon as a miner completes the courses, he should take exams. The hardest one is a computer test called "Testing Pants for Sadness".

The test consists of n questions; the questions are to be answered strictly in the order in which they are given, from question 1 to question n. Question i contains ai answer variants, exactly one of them is correct. 

A click is regarded as selecting any answer in any question. The goal is to select the correct answer for each of the n questions. If Vaganych selects a wrong answer for some question, then all selected answers become unselected and the test starts from the very beginning, from question 1 again. But Vaganych remembers everything. The order of answers for each question and the order of questions remain unchanged, as well as the question and answers themselves.

Vaganych is very smart and his memory is superb, yet he is unbelievably unlucky and knows nothing whatsoever about the test's theme. How many clicks will he have to perform in the worst case?

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). It is the number of questions in the test. The second line contains space-separated n positive integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), the number of answer variants to question i.

Output

Print a single number — the minimal number of clicks needed to pass the test it the worst-case scenario. 

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Note

Note to the second sample. In the worst-case scenario you will need five clicks: 

  * the first click selects the first variant to the first question, this answer turns out to be wrong. 
  * the second click selects the second variant to the first question, it proves correct and we move on to the second question; 
  * the third click selects the first variant to the second question, it is wrong and we go back to question 1; 
  * the fourth click selects the second variant to the first question, it proves as correct as it was and we move on to the second question; 
  * the fifth click selects the second variant to the second question, it proves correct, the test is finished. 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = input()
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    a = [0] + a
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) from standard input. It then calculates the total number of different ways to answer all the questions in the test, where each question `i` has `a[i]` possible answers. The result is printed to standard output. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `a` are consumed, and the calculated total number of different ways to answer the questions is printed. Edge cases include invalid input formats, such as non-integer values or out-of-bound integers, which are not handled by the function.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
