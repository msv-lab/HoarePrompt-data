Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of questions `n`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a`, which represents the number of answer variants for each question.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to 0.
   - For each question `i` (from 1 to `n`), it calculates the number of clicks required in the worst case to get the correct answer for that question.
   - The formula used is `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i`. This formula accounts for:
     - `1` click to select the correct answer.
     - `(a[i] - 1) * i` clicks to account for the worst-case scenario where the correct answer is the last one tried, and each wrong answer causes a reset to the beginning of the test, requiring `i` clicks to reach the current question again.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of clicks required in the worst case.

The program handles the problem description correctly and matches the expected output for the given examples. It also handles edge cases within the constraints provided (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program works correctly in all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
