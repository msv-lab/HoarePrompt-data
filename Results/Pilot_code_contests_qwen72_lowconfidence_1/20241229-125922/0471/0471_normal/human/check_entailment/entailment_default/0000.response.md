Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code handles the input and processes the data. The problem description specifies that the input consists of two lines: the first line is an integer `n` representing the number of questions, and the second line is a space-separated list of integers representing the number of answer variants for each question. However, the code uses `raw_input()` to read the list of integers, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy means the code will not work as intended in Python 3 environments, which are more commonly used today.

Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum number of clicks in the worst-case scenario is incorrect. The current implementation adds `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` to the total number of clicks for each question `i`. This formula is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the number of clicks required to ensure the correct answer is selected in the worst-case scenario.

The correct formula for the worst-case scenario should be:
- For the first question, the worst-case scenario is `a[1]` clicks (since all answers need to be tried).
- For subsequent questions, the worst-case scenario is `a[i] * i` clicks, because if the wrong answer is selected, the test resets, and all previous questions need to be re-answered.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += a[i] * (i + 1)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum number of clicks in the worst-case scenario as per the problem description. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
