Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with the way it reads input. Specifically, the use of `raw_input()` is deprecated in Python 3, and it should be replaced with `input()`. This will cause the program to fail when run in Python 3, which is the more commonly used version today.

Additionally, the variable `n` is read as a string and not converted to an integer before being used in the loop, which will also cause an error.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Use input() instead of raw_input()
    a = [0] + a
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i
    print(ans)
```

With these changes, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
