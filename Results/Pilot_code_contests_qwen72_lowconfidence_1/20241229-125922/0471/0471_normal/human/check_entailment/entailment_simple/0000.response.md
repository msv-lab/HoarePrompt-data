Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads `n` using `input()`, which is correct.
   - However, it uses `raw_input().split()` to read the list of integers `a`. In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. Therefore, this line should be `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The program prepends a `0` to the list `a` using `a = [0] + a`. This is unnecessary and incorrect. The list `a` should represent the number of answer variants for each question directly, without the need for a leading `0`.
   - The formula used in the loop `ans += 1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` is incorrect. The correct formula to calculate the number of clicks in the worst case should be `ans += (a[i] - 1) * i + 1`.

3. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each question `i`, the worst-case number of clicks to find the correct answer is `(a[i] - 1) * i + 1`. This is because:
     - `(a[i] - 1)` is the number of wrong answers Vaganych can choose before finding the correct one.
     - `i` is the position of the question, so each wrong answer resets the test to the beginning, requiring `i` clicks to get back to the current question.
     - `+ 1` accounts for the final correct click.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (a[i] - 1) * (i + 1) + 1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling:**
  - `n = int(input())` reads the number of questions as an integer.
  - `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads the list of integers representing the number of answer variants for each question.
- **Logic:**
  - The loop iterates over each question `i` (from 0 to `n-1`).
  - For each question, it calculates the number of clicks in the worst case using the formula `(a[i] - 1) * (i + 1) + 1` and adds it to `ans`.
  - Finally, it prints the total number of clicks.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it uses the wrong formula and incorrectly handles the input. The corrected program follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for any valid input.
