Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down the key points to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of questions.
   - It then reads a list of integers `a`, where each integer represents the number of answer variants for each question.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of clicks needed.
   - It iterates over each question from 1 to `n`.
   - For each question `i`, it adds `1 + (a[i] - 1) * i` to `ans`. This formula accounts for the worst-case scenario:
     - `1` represents the click to select the correct answer.
     - `(a[i] - 1) * i` represents the clicks needed to try all wrong answers for question `i` and the subsequent resets to the beginning of the test.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `ans`, which is the total number of clicks needed in the worst case.

### Verification of the Formula:
- For each question `i`, the number of clicks needed in the worst case is:
  - `1` click to select the correct answer.
  - `(a[i] - 1)` clicks to try all wrong answers.
  - Each wrong answer causes a reset to the beginning, so the total number of resets for question `i` is `(a[i] - 1) * i`.

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2\n1 1`
  - Calculation: `1 + (1 - 1) * 1 + 1 + (1 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2`
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `2\n2 2`
  - Calculation: `1 + (2 - 1) * 1 + 1 + (2 - 1) * 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `1\n10`
  - Calculation: `1 + (10 - 1) * 1 = 1 + 9 = 10`
  - Output: `10`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the total number of clicks needed in the worst case for the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
