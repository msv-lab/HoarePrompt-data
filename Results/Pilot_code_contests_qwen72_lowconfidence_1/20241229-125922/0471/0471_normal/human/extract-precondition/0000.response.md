Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two inputs: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of questions in the test, and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) where each element represents the number of answer variants for each question.** 

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the appropriate parameters. A corrected function definition would be:

```python
def func(n, a):
```

With the precondition updated to reflect the function parameters:

Precondition: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), where each integer ai represents the number of answer variants for question i.**
