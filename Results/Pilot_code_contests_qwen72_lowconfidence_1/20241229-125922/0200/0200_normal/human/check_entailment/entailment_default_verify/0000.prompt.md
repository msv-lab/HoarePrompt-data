You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's denote a function 

<image>

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. You have to calculate the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array. 

Output

Print one integer — the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.

Note

In the first example:

  1. d(a1, a2) = 0; 
  2. d(a1, a3) = 2; 
  3. d(a1, a4) = 0; 
  4. d(a1, a5) = 2; 
  5. d(a2, a3) = 0; 
  6. d(a2, a4) = 0; 
  7. d(a2, a5) = 0; 
  8. d(a3, a4) = - 2; 
  9. d(a3, a5) = 0; 
  10. d(a4, a5) = 2. 
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    sm = 0
    m = dict()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cnt = 0
        diff = 0
        if a[i] in m:
            cnt += m[a[i]]
            diff += a[i] * m[a[i]]
        if a[i] + 1 in m:
            cnt += m[a[i] + 1]
            diff += (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]
        if a[i] - 1 in m:
            cnt += m[a[i] - 1]
            diff += (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]
        ans += sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)
        sm += a[i]
        if a[i] in m:
            m[a[i]] += 1
        else:
            m[a[i]] = 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of \(d(a_i, a_j)\) over all pairs \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\). The program uses a dictionary to keep track of counts and sums of elements and their neighbors, which helps in efficiently calculating the required sum. After reviewing the logic and considering various edge cases, the program seems to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the standard input. It then processes the list `a` to compute a specific value `ans`. This value is calculated by iterating over the list in reverse order, keeping track of the sum of elements seen so far (`sm`), and using a dictionary `m` to count occurrences of each element and its neighbors (element ± 1). The final computed value `ans` is printed to the standard output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The state after the function execution is: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `m` contains the counts of each element in `a`, and `ans` is the computed result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
