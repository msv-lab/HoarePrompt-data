Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads input using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy can cause issues if the program is run in Python 3.
   - The function should be able to handle the input as specified in the problem description, but the use of `raw_input()` makes it incompatible with Python 3 environments.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The function aims to compute the sum of \( d(a_i, a_j) \) over all pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n \).
   - The function uses a dictionary `m` to keep track of the counts of elements and their neighbors (element ± 1) and calculates the sum `ans` accordingly.
   - However, the logic for calculating `diff` and updating `ans` is not correctly implementing the required function \( d(a_i, a_j) = |a_i - a_j| - 1 \).

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `diff`**:
   - The calculation of `diff` is incorrect. According to the problem, \( d(a_i, a_j) = |a_i - a_j| - 1 \), but the program does not correctly compute this.
   - The program seems to be trying to count occurrences and sum values, but it does not correctly apply the formula \( |a_i - a_j| - 1 \) for all pairs \( (i, j) \).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `5\n1 2 3 1 3`, the expected output is `4`. However, the program does not correctly compute this sum due to the incorrect logic in the loop.
   - Similarly, for other test cases, the program will not produce the correct results because the core logic for calculating \( d(a_i, a_j) \) is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
