Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of `d(ai, aj)` over all pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n` by using a dictionary `m` to keep track of the counts and sums of specific values encountered so far. The key steps are:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `sm` (to store the cumulative sum of array elements) and `ans` (to store the final answer).
2. **Reverse Iteration**: It iterates through the array from the last element to the first, which allows it to efficiently count the occurrences of each value and its neighbors (`a[i]`, `a[i] + 1`, `a[i] - 1`).
3. **Counting and Sum Calculation**:
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if `a[i]`, `a[i] + 1`, and `a[i] - 1` are in the dictionary `m`.
   - It updates the count `cnt` and the difference `diff` based on the values in the dictionary.
   - It updates the answer `ans` by subtracting the appropriate values from the cumulative sum `sm`.
4. **Updating Dictionary**: After processing each element, it updates the dictionary `m` with the current element's count.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description, including large inputs and various possible values for `a[i]`. The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
