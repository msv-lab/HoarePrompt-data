Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads input using `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This could lead to compatibility issues if the code is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Logic for Calculating `d(ai, aj)`**:
   - The problem description defines \( d(a_i, a_j) \) as:
     \[
     d(a_i, a_j) = \begin{cases} 
     0 & \text{if } a_i = a_j \\
     1 & \text{if } a_i < a_j \\
     -1 & \text{if } a_i > a_j 
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - However, the provided program calculates a different value. It uses a dictionary `m` to keep track of the counts of elements and their sums, but it does not correctly compute the values of \( d(a_i, a_j) \) as defined.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of \( d(a_i, a_j) \) over all pairs \( (i, j) \) such that \( 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n \). However, the logic used to update `ans` does not match the definition of \( d(a_i, a_j) \).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 3 1 3
     ```
     The expected output is `4`, but the provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it calculates a different value due to the incorrect logic.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating through the array and calculating \( d(a_i, a_j) \) for each pair \( (i, j) \) and summing these values. This can be done efficiently using a combination of prefix sums and counting techniques.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
