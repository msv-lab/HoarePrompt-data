You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Let's denote a function 

<image>

You are given an array a consisting of n integers. You have to calculate the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array. 

Output

Print one integer — the sum of d(ai, aj) over all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.

Note

In the first example:

  1. d(a1, a2) = 0; 
  2. d(a1, a3) = 2; 
  3. d(a1, a4) = 0; 
  4. d(a1, a5) = 2; 
  5. d(a2, a3) = 0; 
  6. d(a2, a4) = 0; 
  7. d(a2, a5) = 0; 
  8. d(a3, a4) = - 2; 
  9. d(a3, a5) = 0; 
  10. d(a4, a5) = 2.
