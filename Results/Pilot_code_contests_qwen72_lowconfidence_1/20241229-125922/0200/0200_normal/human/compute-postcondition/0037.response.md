The code snippet provided updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` to it. Let's break down the impact on the program step by step:

- `diff` is incremented by the value of `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `sm` is `a[n - 2]`
- `m` is a dictionary
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i] - 1]`
- `diff` remains 0
- `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is not in `m` or `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is updated to `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is in `m`

After executing the code snippet:
- `diff` is now `diff + (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is `diff + (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is not in `m` or `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is updated to `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is in `m`.**
