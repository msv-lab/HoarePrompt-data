Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `m[a[n - 1]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 1]]` is set to 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
