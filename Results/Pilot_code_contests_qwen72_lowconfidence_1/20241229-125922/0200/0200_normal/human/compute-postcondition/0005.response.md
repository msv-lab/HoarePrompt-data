To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `sm` is 0
- `m` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.
3. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`, which simplifies to `n` being greater than `0`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, this condition is already satisfied).
- `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
