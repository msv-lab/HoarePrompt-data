The code snippet `sm += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `sm`. Given the initial state, `sm` was initially set to \(2 \times a[n - 3]\), and `i` is \(n - 3\). Therefore, `sm` will now be updated to include the value of `a[i]`.

Since `i` is \(n - 3\), the value of `a[i]` is `a[n - 3]`. Thus, the new value of `sm` will be:

\[ sm = 2 \times a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] = 3 \times a[n - 3] \]

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `cnt`, `diff`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( 3 \times a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged.**
