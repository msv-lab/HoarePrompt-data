The value of `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is \( n - 2 \) and `sm` is initially \( a[n - 2] \), the new value of `sm` becomes \( a[n - 2] + a[n - 2] \). The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `cnt`, `diff`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 2] + a[n - 2] \), `m` is a dictionary, `i` is \( n - 2 \), `cnt` is the same as before, `diff` is the same as before, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 2] * cnt`.**
