The code snippet updates the dictionary `m` by setting the key `a[i]` to the value 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)
- `sm` is \( a[n - 2] + a[n - 2] \)
- `m` is a dictionary
- `i` is \( n - 2 \)
- `cnt` is the same as before
- `diff` is the same as before
- `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 2] * cnt`

After executing the code snippet `m[a[i]] = 1`:

- The key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m` is set to 1. Since `i` is \( n - 2 \), the key `a[n - 2]` in the dictionary `m` is set to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 2] + a[n - 2] \), `m` is a dictionary with `m[a[n - 2]]` set to 1, `i` is \( n - 2 \), `cnt` is the same as before, `diff` is the same as before, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 2] * cnt`.**
