The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `n - 1`, and `a[i]` is already in the dictionary `m`, the count of `a[n - 1]` in the dictionary `m` is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary with `a[n - 1]` having its count incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.**
