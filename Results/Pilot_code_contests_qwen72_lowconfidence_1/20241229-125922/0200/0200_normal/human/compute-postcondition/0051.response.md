The given code snippet updates the variable `diff` by adding the value `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` to its current value. Let's break down the changes step by step:

- `i` is set to `n - 3`.
- `diff` is initially `a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]]`.
- The new value added to `diff` is `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`.

Since `i` is `n - 3`, the value of `a[i]` is `a[n - 3]`. Therefore, the new value added to `diff` can be written as `(a[n - 3] + 1) * m[a[n - 3] + 1]`.

Thus, the updated value of `diff` is:
\[ \text{diff} = a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]] + (a[n - 3] + 1) * m[a[n - 3] + 1] \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is \( m[a[n - 3]] + m[a[n - 3] + 1] \), `diff` is \( a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]] + (a[n - 3] + 1) * m[a[n - 3] + 1] \), `ans` is `ans + -0 + a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]]`, and `m` is the same as before.**
