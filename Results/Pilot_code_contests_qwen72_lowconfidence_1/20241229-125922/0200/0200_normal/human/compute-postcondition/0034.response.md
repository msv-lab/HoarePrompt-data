The given code snippet modifies the variable `diff`. The initial value of `diff` is `sm * cnt`, and the new value of `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` to it. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `a[i]` refers to `a[n - 2]`, which is also `sm`.

Therefore, the new value of `diff` is calculated as follows:
- Initial `diff`: `sm * cnt`
- Update to `diff`: `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` = `(sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`

Thus, the new value of `diff` is:
- New `diff`: `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`, `ans` is `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`**
