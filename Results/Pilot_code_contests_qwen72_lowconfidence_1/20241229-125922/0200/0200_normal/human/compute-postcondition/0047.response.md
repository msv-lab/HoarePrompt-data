The code snippet `cnt += m[a[i]]` updates the value of `cnt` by adding the value of `m[a[i]]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `cnt` was initially 0.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `a[i]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `i`, which is `a[n - 3]`.
- `m` is a dictionary or mapping, and `m[a[i]]` retrieves the value associated with the key `a[n - 3]`.

Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `0 + m[a[n - 3]]`, which simplifies to `cnt` being `m[a[n - 3]]`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `i`, `diff`, `ans`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is `m[a[n - 3]]`, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 3] * cnt`, and `m` is the same as before.**
