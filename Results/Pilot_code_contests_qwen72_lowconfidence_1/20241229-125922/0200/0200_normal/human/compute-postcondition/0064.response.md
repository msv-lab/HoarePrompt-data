Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the standard input. It then processes the list `a` to compute a specific value `ans`. This value is calculated by iterating over the list in reverse order, keeping track of the sum of elements seen so far (`sm`), and using a dictionary `m` to count occurrences of each element and its neighbors (element ± 1). The final computed value `ans` is printed to the standard output. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The state after the function execution is: `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `m` contains the counts of each element in `a`, and `ans` is the computed result. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input values for `n` and `a` do not meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9), the function may behave unpredictably or inefficiently.
- The function assumes that the input is always valid and does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values).
- The function does not handle the case where the input list `a` is empty, which would lead to an incorrect calculation or potential errors.
