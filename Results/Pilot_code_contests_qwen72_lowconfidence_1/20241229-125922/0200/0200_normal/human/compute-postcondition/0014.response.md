The code snippet updates the variable `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` refers to the last element in the list `a`. The dictionary `m` is accessed with the key `a[i] + 1`, which must exist in the dictionary for this operation to proceed without raising a `KeyError`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `sm` is 0
- `m` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`

The specific changes made by the code snippet are:
- `diff` is updated by the expression `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`

Since `m` is initially an empty dictionary, the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` must be explicitly defined or assumed to be 0 if not present. However, the problem statement indicates that `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`, suggesting that `m[a[i] + 1]` is a valid key-value pair in the dictionary.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `diff` is updated by the value `(a[n-1] + 1) * m[a[n-1] + 1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`, `diff` is updated by `(a[n-1] + 1) * m[a[n-1] + 1]`**
