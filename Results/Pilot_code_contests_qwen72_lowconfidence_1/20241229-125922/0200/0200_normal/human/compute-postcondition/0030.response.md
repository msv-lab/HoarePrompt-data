The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, and `a[n - 2]` is stored in `sm`, the key `a[n - 2]` or `sm` is used to access the dictionary `m`. The value associated with this key in `m` is added to `cnt`.

Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing the code, `cnt` is now equal to `m[sm]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is `m[sm]`, `diff` is 0.
