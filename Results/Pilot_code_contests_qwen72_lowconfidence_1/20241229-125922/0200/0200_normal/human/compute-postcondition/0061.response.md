Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `m` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that element in `a`, `ans` is the result of the computation based on the loop logic, and `i` is -1.**
