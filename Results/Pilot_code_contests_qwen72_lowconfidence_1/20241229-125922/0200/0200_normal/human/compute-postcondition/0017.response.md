The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value associated with the key `a[i] - 1` in the dictionary `m`. Since `a[i] - 1` is already a key in `m`, this operation will update `cnt` accordingly. The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` remains unchanged.**
