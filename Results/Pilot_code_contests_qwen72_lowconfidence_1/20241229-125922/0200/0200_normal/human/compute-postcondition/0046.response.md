The code snippet sets the variable `diff` to 0. This impacts the `diff` variable only, while the other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `i`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `m`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)
- `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \)
- `i` is \( n - 3 \)
- `cnt` is 0
- `diff` is the same as before
- `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 3] * cnt`

After executing the code snippet:
- `diff` is set to 0

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 3] * cnt`, and `m` is the same as before.**
