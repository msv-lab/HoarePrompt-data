The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0**
