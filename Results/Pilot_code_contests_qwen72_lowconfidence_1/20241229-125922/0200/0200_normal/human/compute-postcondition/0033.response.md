The code snippet `cnt += m[a[i] + 1]` updates the value of `cnt` by adding the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
- `sm` is `a[n - 2]`.
- `m` is a dictionary.
- If `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is set to `m[sm]` and `diff` is set to `sm * cnt`.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`.
- Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`.
- In both cases, `i` is `n - 2`.

The code `cnt += m[a[i] + 1]` affects the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, `a[i]` is `a[n - 2]`, which is `sm`.

Therefore, the value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[sm + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is `sm * cnt`, `ans` is `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`**.
