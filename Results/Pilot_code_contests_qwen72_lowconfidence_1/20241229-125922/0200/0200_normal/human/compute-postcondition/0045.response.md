The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This changes the value of `cnt` from its previous state to 0. The values of other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `i`, `diff`, `ans`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is the same as before, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 3] * cnt`. If `a[n - 3]` is in `m`, `m[a[n - 3]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 3]]` is set to 1.**
