The code snippet `m[a[i]] += 1` increments the value in the dictionary `m` at the key `a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)
- `sm` is \( 3 \times a[n - 3] \)
- `i` is \( n - 3 \)
- `cnt` is 0
- `diff` is 0
- `ans` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:

- The value of `m[a[n - 3]]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( 3 \times a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `m[a[n - 3]]` is incremented by 1.**
