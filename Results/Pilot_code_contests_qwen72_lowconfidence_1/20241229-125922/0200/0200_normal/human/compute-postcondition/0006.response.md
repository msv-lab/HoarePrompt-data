The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This operation does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged except for the new value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0**
