The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the value of `m[a[i] + 1]` to it. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)
- `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \)
- `i` is \( n - 3 \)
- `cnt` is 0
- `diff` is 0
- `ans` is updated to `ans + -0 + a[n - 3] * cnt`
- `m` is the same as before
- If `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is set to `m[a[n - 3]]` and `diff` is set to `a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[a[i] + 1]`

Since `i` is \( n - 3 \), `a[i]` is `a[n - 3]`. Therefore, the code updates `cnt` to `cnt + m[a[n - 3] + 1]`.

If `a[n - 3]` is in `m`, `cnt` was previously set to `m[a[n - 3]]`. Now, `cnt` is further updated by adding `m[a[n - 3] + 1]` to it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is \( m[a[n - 3]] + m[a[n - 3] + 1] \), `diff` is \( a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]] \), `ans` is `ans + -0 + a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]]`, and `m` is the same as before.**
