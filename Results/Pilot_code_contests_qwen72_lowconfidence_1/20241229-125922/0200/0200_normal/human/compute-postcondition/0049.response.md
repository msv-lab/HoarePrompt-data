Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 3] + a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + -0 + a[n - 3] * cnt`, and `m` is the same as before. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is set to `m[a[n - 3]]` and `diff` is set to `a[n - 3] * m[a[n - 3]]`.***
