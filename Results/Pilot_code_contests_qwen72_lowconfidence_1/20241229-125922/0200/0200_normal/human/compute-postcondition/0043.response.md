Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( a[n - 2] + a[n - 2] \), `i` is \( n - 2 \), `cnt` is the same as before, `diff` is the same as before, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff + a[n - 2] * cnt`. If `a[i]` (or `a[n - 2]`) is in `m`, `m[a[n - 2]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 2]]` is set to 1.***
