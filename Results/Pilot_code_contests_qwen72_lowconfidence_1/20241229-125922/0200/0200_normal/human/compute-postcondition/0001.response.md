The code `a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, the new state after executing the code is:

- `a` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `a` is `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 200000.
- Each element in `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, and `a` is populated with the integers from the input.**
