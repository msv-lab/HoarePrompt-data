To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an input integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `sm` is `a[n - 1]`.
   - `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `m[a[n - 1]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 1]]` is set to 1.
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be decremented from `n - 1` to `n - 2`.
   - `sm` needs to be updated to `a[n - 2]` because `sm` is set to the current value of `a[i]` at the start of each iteration.
   - The dictionary `m` and the variable `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i]` (which is `a[n - 2]`).

5. **Final State**:
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `sm` is now `a[n - 2]`.
   - `m` is updated based on the new value of `a[n - 2]`.
   - `ans` is updated based on the new value of `a[n - 2]`.
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.
   - `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `m[a[n - 2]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 2]]` is set to 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.**
