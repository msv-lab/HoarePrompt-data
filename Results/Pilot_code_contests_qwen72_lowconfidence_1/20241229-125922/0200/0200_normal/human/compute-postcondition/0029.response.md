The code snippet sets `diff` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `i`, `cnt`, or the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `m[a[n - 2]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 2]]` is set to 1. `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0.**
