The given code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` to it. Here's the detailed impact on the program:

- `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `i`, `diff`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition checks whether `a[i] + 1` is in `m` and updates `cnt`, `diff`, and `ans` accordingly, but this specific code snippet only affects `cnt`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `i` is `n - 2`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` remains 0, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is not in `m` or `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is updated to `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)` if `a[i] + 1` is in `m`.**
