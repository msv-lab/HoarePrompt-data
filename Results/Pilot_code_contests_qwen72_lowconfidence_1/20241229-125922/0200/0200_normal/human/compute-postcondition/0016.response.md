Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`. The current value of `a[i] - 1` is a key in the dictionary `m`. If `a[i] + 1` is a key in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]` and `diff` is updated by `(a[n-1] + 1) * m[a[n-1] + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
