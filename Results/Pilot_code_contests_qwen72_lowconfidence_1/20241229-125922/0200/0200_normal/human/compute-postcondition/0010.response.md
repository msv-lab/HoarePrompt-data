The value of `diff` is updated by adding the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]` to its current value. Since `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`, `m[a[i]]` holds a specific integer value. Therefore, `diff` is incremented by the value of `a[i] * m[a[i]]`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i]]`, `diff` is `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`.**
