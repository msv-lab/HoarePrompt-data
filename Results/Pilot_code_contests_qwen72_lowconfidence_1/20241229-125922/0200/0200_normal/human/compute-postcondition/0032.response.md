Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary. If `a[i]` is in `m`, `cnt` is set to `m[sm]` and `diff` is set to `sm * cnt`. `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`. In both cases, `i` is `n - 2`.***
