The code snippet `m[a[i]] = 1` updates the dictionary `m` by setting the key `a[i]` to the value `1`. Here, `i` is `n - 1`, so the key being set is `a[n - 1]`.

Let's list the impact of the code on the program:

- `m` now contains the key `a[n - 1]` with the value `1`.
- The value of `a[n - 1]` is stored in `sm`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `cnt`, `diff`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary with `m[a[n - 1]] = 1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, and `a[i]` is not in `m` (before this operation).**
