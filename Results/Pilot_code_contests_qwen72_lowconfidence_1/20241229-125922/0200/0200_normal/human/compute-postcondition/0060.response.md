Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where \( 1 \leq n \leq 200000 \), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \), `sm` is \( 3 \times a[n - 3] \), `i` is \( n - 3 \), `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[n - 3]` is in `m`, then `m[a[n - 3]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `m[a[n - 3]]` is set to 1.***
