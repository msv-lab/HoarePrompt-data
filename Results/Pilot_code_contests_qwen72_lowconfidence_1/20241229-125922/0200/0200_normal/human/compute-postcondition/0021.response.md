The code snippet provided updates the variable `sm` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
- `sm` was initially 0 and is now updated to `sm + a[i]`, which means `sm` is now `a[n - 1]` because `i` is `n - 1`.
- `m` remains an empty dictionary.
- The value of `ans` is not directly affected by this snippet, but it was previously updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`.
- `i` is still `n - 1`.
- The values of `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged from their previous state, which could have been modified based on the conditions involving `a[i] - 1` being a key in the dictionary `m`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 1] * (1 - cnt)`, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.**
