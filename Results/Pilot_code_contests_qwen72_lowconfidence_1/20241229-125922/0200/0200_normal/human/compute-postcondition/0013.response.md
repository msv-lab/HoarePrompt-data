The code snippet updates the value of `cnt` by adding the value associated with the key `a[i] + 1` in the dictionary `m`. Given the initial state, we know that `a[i] + 1` is a key in the dictionary `m`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `cnt` is incremented by the value `m[a[i] + 1]`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `sm` is 0
- `m` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`**
