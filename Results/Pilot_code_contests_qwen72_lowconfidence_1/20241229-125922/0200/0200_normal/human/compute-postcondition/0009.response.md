The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`. Since `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`, `m[a[i]]` holds a specific integer value which is added to `cnt`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is a key in the dictionary `m`.**
