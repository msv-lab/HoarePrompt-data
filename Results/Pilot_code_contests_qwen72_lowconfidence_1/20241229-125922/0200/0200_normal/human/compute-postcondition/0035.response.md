Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `m` is a dictionary, `i` is `n - 2`. If `a[i] + 1` is in `m`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[sm + 1]`, `diff` is updated to `sm * cnt + (sm + 1) * m[sm + 1]`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `diff` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to `ans + -diff - a[n - 2] * (1 - cnt)`.***
