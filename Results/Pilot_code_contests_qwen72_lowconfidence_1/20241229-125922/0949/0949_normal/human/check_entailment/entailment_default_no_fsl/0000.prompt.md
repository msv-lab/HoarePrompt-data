You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n boxers, the weight of the i-th boxer is a_i. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1 before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​a_i will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001 (but no more).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of boxers. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000) is the weight of the i-th boxer.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of people in a team.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 4 1


Output

4


Input

6
1 1 1 4 4 4


Output

5

Note

In the first example, boxers should not change their weights — you can just make a team out of all of them.

In the second example, one boxer with a weight of 1 can be increased by one (get the weight of 2), one boxer with a weight of 4 can be reduced by one, and the other can be increased by one (resulting the boxers with a weight of 3 and 5, respectively). Thus, you can get a team consisting of boxers with weights of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Program:
```
from itertools import chain

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(sorted(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    team = set()
    for boxer in a:
        if boxer - 1 > 0 and boxer - 1 <= 150001 and (boxer - 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer - 1)
        elif boxer > 0 and boxer <= 150001 and (boxer not in team):
            team.add(boxer)
        elif boxer + 1 > 0 and boxer + 1 <= 150001 and (boxer + 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer + 1)
    print(len(team), team)


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 150000` and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000`. It then creates a set `team` containing unique integers that are either one less than, equal to, or one more than the elements of `a`, provided they satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ x ≤ 150001` and are not already in `team`. After processing, the function prints the size of the `team` set followed by the elements of the set. If the input list `a` is empty, the function prints `0` and an empty set. The function does not return any value.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
