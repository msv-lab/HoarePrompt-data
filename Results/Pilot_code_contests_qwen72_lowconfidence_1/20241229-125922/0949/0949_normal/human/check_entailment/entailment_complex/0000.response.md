Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect:

1. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a single integer representing the maximum possible number of people in the team. However, the provided program prints both the length of the team set and the team set itself. This violates the output format requirement.

2. **Redundant Conditions**: The conditions in the `for` loop are redundant and can be simplified. Specifically, the conditions `boxer - 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 > 0` are unnecessary because the problem guarantees that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000`, so `boxer - 1` and `boxer + 1` will always be positive.

3. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The logic for adding elements to the `team` set can be optimized. The current approach tries to add `boxer - 1`, `boxer`, and `boxer + 1` to the set, but it does not guarantee that the maximum number of unique weights is achieved. A more efficient approach would be to iterate through the sorted list and try to add the smallest possible unique weight at each step.

### Corrected Version of the Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description requirements:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(sorted(map(int, input().split())))
    team = set()
    last_added = 0
    
    for boxer in a:
        for weight in [boxer - 1, boxer, boxer + 1]:
            if 1 <= weight <= 150001 and weight not in team and weight > last_added:
                team.add(weight)
                last_added = weight
                break
    
    print(len(team))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted to ensure that we process the boxers in ascending order of their weights.
3. **Team Set**: A set `team` is used to store the unique weights of the boxers in the team.
4. **Last Added Weight**: A variable `last_added` is used to keep track of the last weight added to the team to ensure that we add the smallest possible unique weight at each step.
5. **Weight Selection**: For each boxer, the program tries to add `boxer - 1`, `boxer`, or `boxer + 1` to the team, ensuring that the weight is unique and within the valid range.
6. **Output**: The program prints the size of the `team` set, which represents the maximum possible number of people in the team.

This corrected version ensures that the program meets the problem description requirements and produces the correct output format.
