Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it handles the weights. Specifically, the condition checks for `boxer - 1`, `boxer`, and `boxer + 1` to be added to the team set. However, the way it is structured can lead to suboptimal results because it does not consider the best possible adjustment for each weight to maximize the team size.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 2 3
```

The expected output is `4` because we can adjust the weights as follows:
- Boxer with weight 1 can stay as 1.
- One of the boxers with weight 2 can stay as 2.
- The other boxer with weight 2 can be adjusted to 3.
- The boxer with weight 3 can be adjusted to 4.

Thus, the team can consist of boxers with weights 1, 2, 3, and 4.

However, the given program will output `3` because it might add the first boxer with weight 2 as 1, and then skip adding the other boxer with weight 2 because 1 is already in the team. This leads to a suboptimal solution.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result for every potential case, making it incorrect.
