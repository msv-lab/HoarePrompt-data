You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n boxers, the weight of the i-th boxer is a_i. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1 before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​a_i will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001 (but no more).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of boxers. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000) is the weight of the i-th boxer.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of people in a team.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 4 1


Output

4


Input

6
1 1 1 4 4 4


Output

5

Note

In the first example, boxers should not change their weights — you can just make a team out of all of them.

In the second example, one boxer with a weight of 1 can be increased by one (get the weight of 2), one boxer with a weight of 4 can be reduced by one, and the other can be increased by one (resulting the boxers with a weight of 3 and 5, respectively). Thus, you can get a team consisting of boxers with weights of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Program:
```
from itertools import chain

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(sorted(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    team = set()
    for boxer in a:
        if boxer - 1 > 0 and boxer - 1 <= 150001 and (boxer - 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer - 1)
        elif boxer > 0 and boxer <= 150001 and (boxer not in team):
            team.add(boxer)
        elif boxer + 1 > 0 and boxer + 1 <= 150001 and (boxer + 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer + 1)
    print(len(team), team)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the addition and subtraction of weights. Specifically, the way it adds or subtracts 1 from the boxer's weight to form a unique team can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. 

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 2 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

In this case, the expected output is 5 because we can adjust the weights as follows:
- One boxer with weight 1 remains 1.
- One boxer with weight 2 is increased to 3.
- One boxer with weight 2 remains 2.
- One boxer with weight 3 is decreased to 2.
- One boxer with weight 3 is increased to 4.

This results in a team with weights {1, 2, 3, 4}, which is 4 unique weights. However, the program only outputs 4, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not consider all possible adjustments (i.e., increasing or decreasing by 1) in a way that maximizes the number of unique weights. It simply checks each weight in the order they appear and adds the adjusted weight to the team set, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 150000` and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000`. It then creates a set `team` containing unique integers that are either one less than, equal to, or one more than the elements of `a`, provided they satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ x ≤ 150001` and are not already in `team`. After processing, the function prints the size of the `team` set followed by the elements of the set. If the input list `a` is empty, the function prints `0` and an empty set. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
