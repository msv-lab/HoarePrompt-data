You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n boxers, the weight of the i-th boxer is a_i. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1 before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​a_i will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001 (but no more).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of boxers. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000) is the weight of the i-th boxer.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of people in a team.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 4 1


Output

4


Input

6
1 1 1 4 4 4


Output

5

Note

In the first example, boxers should not change their weights — you can just make a team out of all of them.

In the second example, one boxer with a weight of 1 can be increased by one (get the weight of 2), one boxer with a weight of 4 can be reduced by one, and the other can be increased by one (resulting the boxers with a weight of 3 and 5, respectively). Thus, you can get a team consisting of boxers with weights of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Program:
```
from itertools import chain

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(sorted(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    team = set()
    for boxer in a:
        if boxer - 1 > 0 and boxer - 1 <= 150001 and (boxer - 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer - 1)
        elif boxer > 0 and boxer <= 150001 and (boxer not in team):
            team.add(boxer)
        elif boxer + 1 > 0 and boxer + 1 <= 150001 and (boxer + 1 not in team):
            team.add(boxer + 1)
    print(len(team), team)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
