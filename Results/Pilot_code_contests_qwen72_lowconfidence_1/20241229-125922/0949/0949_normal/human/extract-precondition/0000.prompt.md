You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are n boxers, the weight of the i-th boxer is a_i. Each of them can change the weight by no more than 1 before the competition (the weight cannot become equal to zero, that is, it must remain positive). Weight is always an integer number.

It is necessary to choose the largest boxing team in terms of the number of people, that all the boxers' weights in the team are different (i.e. unique).

Write a program that for given current values ​a_i will find the maximum possible number of boxers in a team.

It is possible that after some change the weight of some boxer is 150001 (but no more).

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150000) — the number of boxers. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000) is the weight of the i-th boxer.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of people in a team.

Examples

Input

4
3 2 4 1


Output

4


Input

6
1 1 1 4 4 4


Output

5

Note

In the first example, boxers should not change their weights — you can just make a team out of all of them.

In the second example, one boxer with a weight of 1 can be increased by one (get the weight of 2), one boxer with a weight of 4 can be reduced by one, and the other can be increased by one (resulting the boxers with a weight of 3 and 5, respectively). Thus, you can get a team consisting of boxers with weights of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Function definition:
