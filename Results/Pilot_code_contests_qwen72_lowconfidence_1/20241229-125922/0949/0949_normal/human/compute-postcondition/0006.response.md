Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`, `team` is an empty set, and either `boxer - 1 <= 0` or `boxer - 1 > 150001` or `boxer - 1` is in `team`***
