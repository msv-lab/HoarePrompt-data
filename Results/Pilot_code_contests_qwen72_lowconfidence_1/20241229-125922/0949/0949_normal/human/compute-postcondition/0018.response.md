The provided Python code snippet adds the value `boxer + 1` to the set `team`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\).
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\).
- `a` must have at least two elements.
- `boxer` is the second element in `a`.
- If `boxer - 1 > 0` and `boxer - 1 <= 150001` and `boxer - 1` is not in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `boxer > 0` and `boxer <= 150001` and `boxer` is not in `team`, then `boxer` is added to `team`.
- If neither condition is met, and if `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001` and `boxer + 1` is not in `team`, then `boxer + 1` is added to `team`.
- If none of these conditions are satisfied, no changes are made to `team`.

The code snippet:
```python
team.add(boxer + 1)
```

Impact of the code:
- The value `boxer + 1` is added to the set `team`.
- The conditions mentioned in the initial state are not checked by this code snippet, so they remain as they were.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least two elements, `boxer` is the second element in `a`, `team` now contains the value `boxer + 1`.**
