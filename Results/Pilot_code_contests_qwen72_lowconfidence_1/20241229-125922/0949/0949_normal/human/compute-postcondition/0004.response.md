Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`, `team` is an empty set, and the value of `boxer - 1` is greater than 0, less than or equal to 150001, and not present in `team`.**
