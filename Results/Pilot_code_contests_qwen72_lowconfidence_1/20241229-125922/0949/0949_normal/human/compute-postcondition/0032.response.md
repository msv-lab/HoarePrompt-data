Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 150000` and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000`. It then creates a set `team` containing unique integers that are either one less than, equal to, or one more than the elements of `a`, provided they satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ x ≤ 150001` and are not already in `team`. After processing, the function prints the size of the `team` set followed by the elements of the set. If the input list `a` is empty, the function prints `0` and an empty set. The function does not return any value. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Empty Input List**: If the input list `a` is empty (i.e., `n = 0`), the function correctly handles this case by printing `0` and an empty set.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The function ensures that only integers within the range `1` to `150001` are added to the `team` set. This prevents out-of-bound values from being included.
- **Duplicate Elements**: The function correctly handles duplicate elements in the input list `a` by using a set `team`, ensuring that each integer is added only once.
- **Missing Functionality**: The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. This means that the function's output is not captured programmatically and can only be observed through the standard output.
