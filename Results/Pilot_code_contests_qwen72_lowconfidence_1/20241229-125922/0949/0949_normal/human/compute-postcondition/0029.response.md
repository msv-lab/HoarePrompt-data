Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `team` is a set containing unique integers that are either one less than, equal to, or one more than the elements of `a`, provided they satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq x \leq 150001\) and are not already in `team`. If `a` is empty, `team` remains an empty set.**
