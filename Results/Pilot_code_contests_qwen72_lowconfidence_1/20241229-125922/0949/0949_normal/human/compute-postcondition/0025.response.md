The code snippet `team.add(boxer + 1)` adds the value `boxer + 1` to the set `team`. According to the initial state, `boxer` is the third element in the sorted list `a`, and the conditions specified in the initial state ensure that `boxer + 1` is a valid addition to `team` (i.e., it is within the range and not already in `team`).

Given this, the impact of the code is to add the value `boxer + 1` to the set `team`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least three elements, `boxer` is the third element in `a`, `team` contains the value `boxer + 1`.**
