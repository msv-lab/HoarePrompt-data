Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least three elements, and `boxer` is the third element in `a`. If `boxer - 1` is greater than 0, less than or equal to 150001, and not already in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer - 1`. Otherwise, if `boxer` is greater than 0, less than or equal to 150001, and not already in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer`. If neither condition is met, and if `boxer + 1` is greater than 0, less than or equal to 150001, and not already in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer + 1`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, no changes are made to `team`.***
