The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, maps each component to an integer, sorts the resulting list, and assigns this sorted list to the variable `a`.

- The input is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
- After the execution, `a` will be a sorted list of integers.
- The length of `a` will be `n`.
- Each element in `a` will be between 1 and 150000.

Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000, `a` is a sorted list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000**.
