The code snippet `team.add(boxer)` adds the value of `boxer` to the set `team`.

- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\).
- `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\).
- `a` must have at least two elements.
- `boxer` is the second element in `a`.
- `team` now contains the value `boxer`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least two elements, `boxer` is the second element in `a`, `team` contains the value `boxer`.**
