The code `team.add(boxer + 1)` adds the value of `boxer + 1` to the set `team`. Given the initial conditions, `boxer + 1` is a positive integer between 1 and 150001, and it is not already in `team`.

- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\).
- `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\).
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `boxer` remains the first element in `a`.
- `boxer - 1 <= 0` or `boxer - 1 > 150001` or `boxer - 1` is in `team`.
- `boxer` is either less than or equal to 0, greater than 150001, or `boxer` is in `team`.
- `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001` and `boxer + 1` is not in `team`.

After executing the code, the value of `boxer + 1` is added to `team`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`, `boxer - 1 <= 0` or `boxer - 1 > 150001` or `boxer - 1` is in `team`, `boxer` is either less than or equal to 0, greater than 150001, or `boxer` is in `team`, `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001`, `boxer + 1` is in `team`.**
