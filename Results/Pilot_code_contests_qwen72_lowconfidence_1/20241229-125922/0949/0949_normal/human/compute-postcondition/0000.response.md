The value of `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through the `raw_input()` function. Since `raw_input()` returns a string, `int()` is used to convert this string to an integer. The precondition states that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000, which remains valid after the execution of the code. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000 (updated from user input), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000.**
