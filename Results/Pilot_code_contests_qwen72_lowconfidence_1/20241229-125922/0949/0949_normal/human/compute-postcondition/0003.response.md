To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\).
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\).
- `team` is an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for boxer in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial State of `boxer`**: Before the loop starts, `boxer` is not defined. It will take the value of the first element in `a` when the loop starts.
3. **Initial State of `team`**: `team` is an empty set and remains unchanged by the initial conditions.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `boxer` will be the first element of `a` at the start of the loop, and `team` remains an empty set.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`, `team` is an empty set**
