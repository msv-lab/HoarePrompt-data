Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least two elements, `boxer` is the second element in `a`. If `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001` and `boxer + 1` is not in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `team`.***
