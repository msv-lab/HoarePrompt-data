Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`. If `boxer - 1 > 0` and `boxer - 1 <= 150001` and `boxer - 1` is not in `team`, then `team` contains the value `boxer - 1`. Otherwise, if `boxer > 0` and `boxer <= 150001` and `boxer` is not in `team`, then `boxer` is added to `team`. If neither condition is met, and if `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001` and `boxer + 1` is not in `team`, then `boxer + 1` is added to `team`. If none of these conditions are satisfied, no changes are made to `team`.***
