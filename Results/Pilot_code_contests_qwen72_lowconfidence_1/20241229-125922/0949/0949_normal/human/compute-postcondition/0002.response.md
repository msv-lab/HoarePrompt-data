The code snippet initializes a new empty set named `team`. This operation does not affect the existing state of `n` or `a`, which remain as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150000, `a` is a sorted list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000, `team` is an empty set**.
