Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 150000\), `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 150000\), `a` must have at least one element, `boxer` is the first element in `a`, `boxer - 1 <= 0` or `boxer - 1 > 150001` or `boxer - 1` is in `team`, `boxer` is either less than or equal to 0, greater than 150001, or `boxer` is in `team`. If `boxer + 1 > 0` and `boxer + 1 <= 150001` and `boxer + 1` is not in `team`, then `boxer + 1` is added to `team`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `team`.***
