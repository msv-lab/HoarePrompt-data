The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 150000` and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 150000`. It then creates a set `team` containing unique integers that are either one less than, equal to, or one more than the elements of `a`, provided they satisfy the conditions `1 ≤ x ≤ 150001` and are not already in `team`. After processing, the function prints the size of the `team` set followed by the elements of the set. If the input list `a` is empty, the function prints `0` and an empty set. The function does not return any value.
