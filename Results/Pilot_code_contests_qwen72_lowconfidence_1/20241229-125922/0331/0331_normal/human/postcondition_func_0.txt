The function `func_1` is a recursive function that takes two non-negative integer parameters `l` and `r` where `l` â‰¤ `r`. It divides the range `[l, r]` into two halves and recursively calls itself on each half. After the recursive calls, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `l`, `ind`, `ind + 1`, and `r`, where `ind` is the midpoint of the current range. The function does not return any value explicitly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has divided the range `[l, r]` into smaller sub-ranges and performed operations (via `func_2`) on these sub-ranges. The exact nature of these operations is not specified within `func_1` but is left to `func_2`. Edge cases include when `l` equals `r`, in which case no further recursion occurs and `func_2` is not called.
