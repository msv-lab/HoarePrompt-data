The code `ind1 += 1` increments the value of `ind1` by 1. The initial value of `ind1` is either `lf + 1` or `lf`, depending on the condition `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`. After the increment, `ind1` will be:

- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, `ind1` was `lf + 1`, so after the increment, `ind1` will be `lf + 2`.
- Otherwise, `ind1` was `lf`, so after the increment, `ind1` will be `lf + 1`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, followed by `queue[ind1]`, if `queue[ind1]` < `queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`; otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, with `queue[ind1]` being greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.**
