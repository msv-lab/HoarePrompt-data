The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind2])` appends the value of `queue[ind2]` to the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `a` already contains either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]` depending on the comparison between `queue[ind1]` and `queue[ind2]`.

- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `a` initially contains `queue[lf]`, `ind1` is `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is `ls`.
- Otherwise, `a` initially contains `queue[ls]`, `ind1` is `lf`, and `ind2` is `ls + 1`.

In both cases, `a.append(queue[ind2])` will add `queue[ind2]` to the list `a`. The specific value of `ind2` is either `ls` or `ls + 1`, but in either case, `queue[ind2]` is added to `a`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`.
- `rf` is a non-negative integer.
- `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`.
- `rs` is a non-negative integer.
- `queue` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, and now also contains `queue[ind2]`.
- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `ind1` is `lf + 1` and `ind2` is `ls`.
- Otherwise, `ind1` is `lf` and `ind2` is `ls + 1`.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]` and now also contains `queue[ind2]`, if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]` then `ind1` is `lf + 1` and `ind2` is `ls`, otherwise `ind1` is `lf` and `ind2` is `ls + 1`.**
