The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind1])` adds the element at index `ind1` of the list `queue` to the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `ind1` is less than or equal to `rf`.
- `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:

- The list `a` now includes one more element from `queue` at the position `ind1`.
- The value of `ind1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`ind1` is less than or equal to `rf`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1]`.**
