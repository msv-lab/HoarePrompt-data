To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `ind1` is `rf + 1`
- `ind2` is `rs + 1`
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes all elements from `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - (rs + 1)) : rs + 1]` which simplifies to `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - ind2_initial) : rs + 1]` where `ind2_initial` is the initial value of `ind2`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(lf, rs + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `lf` to `rs + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `lf` must be less than or equal to `rs`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `ind1` is `rf + 1`
   - `ind2` is `rs + 1`
   - `a` is a list that includes elements from `queue` based on the conditions mentioned.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `lf <= rs`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure `lf` is less than or equal to `rs`.
   - No adjustments are needed for `ind1` and `ind2` as they are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.
   - The list `a` is already defined and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes all elements from `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - ind2_initial) : rs + 1]`, `lf` must be less than or equal to `rs`**
