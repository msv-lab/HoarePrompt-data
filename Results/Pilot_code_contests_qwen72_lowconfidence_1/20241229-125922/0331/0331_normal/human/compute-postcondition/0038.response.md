The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind2])` appends the element at index `ind2` of the list `queue` to the list `a`.

- `ind1` remains `rf + 1`.
- `ind2` remains `rs` or less.
- The list `a` initially contains elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the element `queue[ind2 - 1]`. After executing the code, `a` will include the additional element `queue[ind2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 1]` and `queue[ind2]`**.
