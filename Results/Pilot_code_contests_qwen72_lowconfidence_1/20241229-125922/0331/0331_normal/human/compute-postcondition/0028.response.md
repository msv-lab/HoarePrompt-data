The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind1])` adds the element at index `ind1` of the `queue` list to the list `a`.

- `a` was already a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and it included `queue[ind1 - 1]`.
- After executing the code, `a` now includes the element `queue[ind1]` as well, maintaining its non-decreasing order as per the precondition.

The values of `ind1` and `ind2` remain unchanged, but `ind1` must still be less than or equal to `rf` for the loop to execute one more time.

Output State: **`ind1` is `ind1 + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 1]` and `queue[ind1]`. `ind1` must be less than or equal to `rf` for the loop to execute one more time.**
