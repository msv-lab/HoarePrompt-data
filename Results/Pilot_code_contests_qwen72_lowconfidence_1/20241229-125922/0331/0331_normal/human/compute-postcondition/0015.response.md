The value of `ind2` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, `rs`, `queue`, and `a` remain unchanged, except for the update to `ind2`.

- `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`.
- `rf` is a non-negative integer.
- `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`.
- `rs` is a non-negative integer.
- `queue` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]` and now also contains `queue[ind2]`.
- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]` then `ind1` is `lf + 1` and `ind2` was `ls`, otherwise `ind1` is `lf` and `ind2` was `ls + 1`.

After the code execution, `ind2` is now `ls + 1` if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]` or `ls + 2` otherwise.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]` and now also contains `queue[ind2]`, if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]` then `ind1` is `lf + 1` and `ind2` is `ls + 1`, otherwise `ind1` is `lf` and `ind2` is `ls + 2`.**
