The value of `queue[ind2]` is appended to the list `a`. Since `ind2` is equal to `ls` and `a` was initially an empty list, `a` now contains the element `queue[ls]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing `queue[ls]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls`, and `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2]`**
