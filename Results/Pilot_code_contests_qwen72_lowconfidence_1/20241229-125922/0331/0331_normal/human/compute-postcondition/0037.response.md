According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind2` and `rs`. If `ind2` is less than or equal to `rs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind2` is `rs` or less, which means the loop could still execute if `ind2` is not yet greater than `rs`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ind2` must be less than or equal to `rs`. Since `ind2` is already stated to be `rs` or less, no adjustment is needed for `ind2` itself. However, for the loop to execute again, we must ensure that `ind2` is not exactly `rs + 1` (which would terminate the loop), but rather `ind2` must be `rs` or less.

Therefore, the state does not need to be changed since it already satisfies the condition for the loop to continue. The state remains as follows:

State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the element `queue[ind2 - 1]`**
