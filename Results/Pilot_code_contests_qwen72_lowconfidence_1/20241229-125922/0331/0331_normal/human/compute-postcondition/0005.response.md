The code `a.append(queue[ind1])` adds the value of `queue[ind1]` to the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, and `queue[ind1]` is less than `queue[ind2]`. After appending, the list `a` is no longer empty and contains the value of `queue[lf]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the value of `queue[lf]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls`, and the current value of `queue[ind1]` is less than the current value of `queue[ind2]`.**
