The code `ind1 += 1` increments the value of `ind1` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `ind1` is either `lf + 2` or `lf + 1`.
- `ind2` is either `ls` or `ls + 2`.
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, and now also contains `queue[ind1]` (which is either `queue[lf + 2]` or `queue[lf + 1]`).

After executing `ind1 += 1`, the value of `ind1` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `ind1` is now either `lf + 3` or `lf + 2`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, and now also contains `queue[ind1]` (which is either `queue[lf + 2]` or `queue[lf + 1]`). `ind1` is either `lf + 3` or `lf + 2`, `ind2` is either `ls` or `ls + 2`, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`, and `rf` must be at least `lf + 3` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.**
