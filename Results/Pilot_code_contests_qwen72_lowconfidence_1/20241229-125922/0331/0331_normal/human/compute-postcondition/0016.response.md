Postcondition: ***`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, and `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`. If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`. Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is updated to `ls + 2`. In both cases, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.***
