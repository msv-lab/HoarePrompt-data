The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs`. These parameters are non-negative integers with the constraints that `lf` is less than or equal to `rf`, and `ls` is less than or equal to `rs`. Additionally, there is a parameter `queue` which is a list of integers. The function's return value is not specified in the provided information, but based on the parameters, it likely processes these values in some way, possibly related to the elements in `queue`.

Since the output is not explicitly defined, I'll assume the function returns a result based on the given parameters and the `queue`. However, without further details, I can only describe the parameters and leave the exact return value unspecified.

Functionality: **The function accepts four non-negative integer parameters `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs` with the constraints `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs`, and a list of integers `queue`. The function processes these parameters and the list, returning a result based on the input.**
