The code `a.append(queue[ind1])` appends the element at index `ind1` in the `queue` to the list `a`.

- The value of `ind1` was previously updated to either `lf + 2` or `lf + 1` based on the comparison between `queue[ind1]` and `queue[ind2]`.
- The value of `ind2` was updated to either remain as `ls` or to `ls + 2`.
- The list `a` already contains either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, and possibly `queue[ind1]` or `queue[ind2]` depending on the conditions met before this operation.

Given the initial conditions and the updates made to `ind1` and `ind2`, the new element appended to `a` is `queue[ind1]`, which is now either `queue[lf + 2]` or `queue[lf + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, and now also contains `queue[ind1]` (which is either `queue[lf + 2]` or `queue[lf + 1]`). `ind1` is either `lf + 2` or `lf + 1`, `ind2` is either `ls` or `ls + 2`, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`, and `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.**
