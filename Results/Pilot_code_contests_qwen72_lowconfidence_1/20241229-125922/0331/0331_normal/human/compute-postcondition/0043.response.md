Output State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes all elements from `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - (rs + 1)) : rs + 1]` which simplifies to `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - ind2_initial) : rs + 1]` where `ind2_initial` is the initial value of `ind2`**
