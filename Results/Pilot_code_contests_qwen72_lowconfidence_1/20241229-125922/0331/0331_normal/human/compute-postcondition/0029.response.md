The value of `ind1` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ind2`, `a`, `rf`, and `rs`) remain unchanged. The condition that `ind1` must be less than or equal to `rf` for the loop to execute one more time is still valid.

Output State: **`ind1` is `ind1 + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 2]` and `queue[ind1 - 1]`. `ind1` must be less than or equal to `rf` for the loop to execute one more time.**
