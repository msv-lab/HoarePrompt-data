To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop: `ind2 <= rs`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ind1` is `rf + 1`
- `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]` and `queue[ind2 - 1]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ind2 <= rs` must still be true. This means `ind2` must be less than or equal to `rs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `ind2` must be adjusted to be `rs` or less. Since `ind2` is already `rs + 1` or less, no adjustment is needed for `ind2` to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]` and `queue[ind2 - 1]`**
