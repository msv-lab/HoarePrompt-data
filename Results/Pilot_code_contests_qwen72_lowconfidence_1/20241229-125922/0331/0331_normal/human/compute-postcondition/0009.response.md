The value of `ind2` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing `queue[ls]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, and `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing `queue[ls]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, and `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.**
