The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind1])` adds the element located at index `ind1` of the `queue` list to the end of the list `a`. This operation does not change the values of `ind1`, `ind2`, `rf`, or `rs`, but it does modify the content of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `ind1` is less than `rf`
- `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 2]` and `queue[ind1 - 1]`

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `ind1` is less than `rf`
- `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 2]`, `queue[ind1 - 1]`, and `queue[ind1]`

Output State: **`ind1` is less than `rf`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 2]`, `queue[ind1 - 1]`, and `queue[ind1]`**
