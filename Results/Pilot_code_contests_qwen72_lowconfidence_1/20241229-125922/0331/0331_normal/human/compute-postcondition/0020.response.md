The code snippet `a.append(queue[ind2])` appends the element at index `ind2` in the `queue` to the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively.
- `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers.
- `queue` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`.
- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`.
- Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is updated to `ls + 2`.
- In both cases, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.
- Additionally, `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.

The impact of the code `a.append(queue[ind2])` is that the value at index `ind2` in the `queue` is appended to the list `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively.
- `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers.
- `queue` is a list of integers.
- `a` now contains the elements it originally contained plus `queue[ind2]`.
- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]`, `queue[ind1]`, and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`.
- Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]`, `queue[ind2]`, and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is `ls + 2`.
- In both cases, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.
- Additionally, `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.

Output State: **`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` now contains the elements it originally contained plus `queue[ind2]`, if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]` then `a` contains `queue[lf]`, `queue[ind1]`, and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`, otherwise `a` contains `queue[ls]`, `queue[ind2]`, and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is `ls + 2`, in both cases `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`, and `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.**
