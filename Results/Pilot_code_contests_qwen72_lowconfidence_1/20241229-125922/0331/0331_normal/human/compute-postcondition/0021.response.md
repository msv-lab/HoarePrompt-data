The value of `ind2` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions and the relationships between the variables remain unchanged except for the updated value of `ind2`.

Output State: **`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` now contains the elements it originally contained plus `queue[ind2-1]`, if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2-1]` then `a` contains `queue[lf]`, `queue[ind1]`, and `queue[ind2-1]`, `ind1` is `lf + 2`, and `ind2` is `ls + 1`, otherwise `a` contains `queue[ls]`, `queue[ind2-1]`, and `queue[ind2-1]`, `ind1` is `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is `ls + 3`, in both cases `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 2]`, and `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.**
