The code `ind2 += 1` increments the value of `ind2` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `ind1` is `rf + 1`
- `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]`, `queue[ind2 - 1]`, and `queue[ind2]`

After executing the code:
- The value of `ind2` is incremented by 1, so `ind2` is now `rs + 2` or less (if it was `rs + 1` or less before).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 2` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 3]`, `queue[ind2 - 2]`, and `queue[ind2 - 1]`**
