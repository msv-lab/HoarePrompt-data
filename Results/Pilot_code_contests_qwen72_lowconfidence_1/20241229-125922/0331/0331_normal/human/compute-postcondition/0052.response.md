Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes four non-negative integer parameters `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs` (with the constraints `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs`) and a list of integers `queue`. It merges the sublists `queue[lf:rf+1]` and `queue[ls:rs+1]` into a single sorted sublist in non-decreasing order and places the result back into `queue[lf:rs+1]`. The function modifies the `queue` in place and does not return any value. If `lf > rs`, the function does nothing and `queue` remains unchanged. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If `lf > rs`, the function correctly does nothing and `queue` remains unchanged.
- If `lf == rf + 1` or `ls == rs + 1`, the function handles these cases by ensuring that the appropriate segments of the `queue` are merged and placed back into the correct positions.
- The function assumes that the input list `queue` is valid and contains integers. If `queue` is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are out of bounds of the `queue` (e.g., `rf` or `rs` exceed the length of `queue`). In such cases, the function may raise an `IndexError`.
