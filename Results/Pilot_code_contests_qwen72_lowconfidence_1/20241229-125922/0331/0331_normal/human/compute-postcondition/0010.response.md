Postcondition: ***`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`. If `queue[ind1]` < `queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`. Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]`, `ind1` remains equal to `lf`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, with `queue[ind1]` being greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.***
