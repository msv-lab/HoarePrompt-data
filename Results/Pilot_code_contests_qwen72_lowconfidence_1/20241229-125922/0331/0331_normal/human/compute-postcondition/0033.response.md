Output State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`. If `ind1` exceeded `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`.**
