To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current program state.

### Current Program State:
- `ind1` is `rf + 1`
- `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`. If `ind1` exceeded `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`.

### `while` Loop Condition:
```python
while ind2 <= rs:
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `ind2` is less than or equal to `rs`.
2. **Current State of `ind2`**:
   - `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`.
   - If `ind2` is `rs + 1`, the loop will not execute because `ind2` is not less than or equal to `rs`.
   - If `ind2` is less than or equal to `rs`, the loop will execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `ind2` must be less than or equal to `rs`.
- Since `ind2` can be `rs + 1` (which would prevent the loop from executing), we need to adjust `ind2` to be less than or equal to `rs`.

### Final State:
- `ind1` remains `rf + 1`.
- `ind2` must be less than or equal to `rs`.
- The list `a` remains as described in the initial state.

### State:
**`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`. If `ind1` exceeded `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`.**
