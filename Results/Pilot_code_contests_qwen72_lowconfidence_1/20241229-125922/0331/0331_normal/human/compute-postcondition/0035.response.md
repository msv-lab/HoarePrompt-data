The code `a.append(queue[ind2])` appends the element at index `ind2` from the `queue` list to the list `a`.

- `ind1` remains `rf + 1`.
- `ind2` remains less than or equal to `rs`.
- The list `a` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element from `queue[ind2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the element `queue[ind2]`.**
