To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `ind1 <= rf` is true.

Given the state:
- `ind1` is either `rf + 1` or less than or equal to `rf`.
- `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`.
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`.

For the loop to execute, `ind1` must be less than or equal to `rf`. Since `ind1` can be `rf + 1`, this would prevent the loop from executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `ind1` is less than or equal to `rf`.

The state `ind2` and the list `a` do not directly affect the condition of the `while` loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`ind1` is less than or equal to `rf`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`.**
