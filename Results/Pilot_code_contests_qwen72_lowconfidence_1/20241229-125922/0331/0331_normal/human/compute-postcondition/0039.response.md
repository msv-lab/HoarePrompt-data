The code snippet `ind2 += 1` increments the value of `ind2` by 1. The initial state indicates that `ind2` was `rs` or less, and the list `a` had already been updated to include the element `queue[ind2]`.

Therefore, after executing `ind2 += 1`:

- `ind1` remains `rf + 1`.
- `ind2` is now `rs + 1` or less (since it was `rs` or less and has been incremented by 1).
- The list `a` still contains elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]` and `queue[ind2 - 1]`.

Output State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]` and `queue[ind2 - 1]`**.
