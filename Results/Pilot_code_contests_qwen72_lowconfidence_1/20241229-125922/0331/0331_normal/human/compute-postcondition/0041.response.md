The code `a.append(queue[ind2])` adds the element located at index `ind2` in the `queue` to the end of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `ind1` is `rf + 1`
- `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less
- `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]` and `queue[ind2 - 1]`

After executing the code:
- The list `a` will now include the element `queue[ind2]` at the end.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the elements `queue[ind2 - 2]`, `queue[ind2 - 1]`, and `queue[ind2]`**
