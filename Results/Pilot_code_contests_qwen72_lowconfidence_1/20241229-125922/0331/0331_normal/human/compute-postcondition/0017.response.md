To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`.
- `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers.
- `queue` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`.
- If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then:
  - `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`.
  - `ind1` is updated to `lf + 2`.
  - `ind2` remains equal to `ls`.
- Otherwise:
  - `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind2]`.
  - `ind1` is updated to `lf + 1`.
  - `ind2` is updated to `ls + 2`.
- In both cases, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop will continue to execute as long as both `ind1 <= rf` and `ind2 <= rs`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for `ind1 <= rf`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `ind1` was updated to either `lf + 2` or `lf + 1`.
   - To ensure `ind1 <= rf` for the next iteration, `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` if `ind1` was updated to `lf + 2`, or `lf + 1` if `ind1` was updated to `lf + 1`.

2. **Condition for `ind2 <= rs`:**
   - After the previous iteration, `ind2` was updated to either `ls` (if `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`) or `ls + 2` (if `queue[ind1] >= queue[ind2]`).
   - To ensure `ind2 <= rs` for the next iteration, `rs` must be at least `ls + 2` if `ind2` was updated to `ls + 2`, or `ls` if `ind2` was updated to `ls`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` if `ind1` was updated to `lf + 2`, or `lf + 1` if `ind1` was updated to `lf + 1`.
- `rs` must be at least `ls + 2` if `ind2` was updated to `ls + 2`, or `ls` if `ind2` was updated to `ls`.

Given the current state, we need to ensure that:
- `rf` is at least `lf + 2`.
- `rs` is at least `ls + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`lf` and `ls` are non-negative integers where `lf + 1 <= rf` and `ls + 1 <= rs`, respectively, `rf` and `rs` are non-negative integers, `queue` is a list of integers, and `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`. If `queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 2`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`. Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind2]`, `ind1` is updated to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` is updated to `ls + 2`. In both cases, `queue[ind1]` is greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`. Additionally, `rf` must be at least `lf + 2` and `rs` must be at least `ls + 2`.**
