The code `a.append(queue[ind1])` appends the element at index `ind1` of the `queue` to the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`
- `rf` is a non-negative integer
- `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`
- `rs` is a non-negative integer
- `queue` is a list of integers
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`
- If `queue[ind1]` < `queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`.
- Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]`, `ind1` remains equal to `lf`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, with `queue[ind1]` being greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.

After executing `a.append(queue[ind1])`:
- The value at `queue[ind1]` is appended to the list `a`.

The updated state is:
- `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`
- `rf` is a non-negative integer
- `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`
- `rs` is a non-negative integer
- `queue` is a list of integers
- `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, followed by `queue[ind1]`
- If `queue[ind1]` < `queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`.
- Otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` remains equal to `lf`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, with `queue[ind1]` being greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf + 1 <= rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls + 1 <= rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing either `queue[lf]` or `queue[ls]`, followed by `queue[ind1]`, if `queue[ind1]` < `queue[ind2]`, then `a` contains `queue[lf]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, and `ind2` remains equal to `ls`; otherwise, `a` contains `queue[ls]` and `queue[ind1]`, `ind1` remains equal to `lf`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls + 1`, with `queue[ind1]` being greater than or equal to `queue[ind2 - 1]`.**
