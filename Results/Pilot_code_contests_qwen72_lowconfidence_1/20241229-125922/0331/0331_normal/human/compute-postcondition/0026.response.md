The code snippet `ind1 += 1` increments the value of `ind1` by 1. Here's the step-by-step impact of the code:

- The value of `ind1` is incremented by 1.
- The other variables (`ind2`, `rf`, `rs`, `a`, and `queue`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `ind1` is less than or equal to `rf` might no longer be true if `ind1` was equal to `rf` before the increment.

Therefore, the output state is:

**`ind1` is `ind1 + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 1]`.**
