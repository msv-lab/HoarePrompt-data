The value of `ind1` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `ind1` is less than `rf`, and `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`. After incrementing `ind1`, it may or may not still be less than `rf` depending on its previous value. The list `a` is not modified by this operation, so it retains its previous properties. The conditions regarding `ind2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind1` is `ind1 + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`, and `a` now includes `queue[ind1 - 3]`, `queue[ind1 - 2]`, and `queue[ind1 - 1]`**
