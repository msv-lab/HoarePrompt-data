To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while ind1 <= rf and ind2 <= rs:
```

### Initial State:
- `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`
- `rf` is a non-negative integer
- `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`
- `rs` is a non-negative integer
- `queue` is a list of integers
- `a` is an empty list
- `ind1` is equal to `lf`
- `ind2` is equal to `ls`

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `ind1 <= rf`
2. `ind2 <= rs`

### Analysis:
- `ind1` starts as `lf` and `ind2` starts as `ls`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, both `lf` and `ls` must satisfy their respective conditions:
  - `lf` must be less than or equal to `rf`.
  - `ls` must be less than or equal to `rs`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the conditions `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs` are already satisfied by the problem constraints. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls`**
