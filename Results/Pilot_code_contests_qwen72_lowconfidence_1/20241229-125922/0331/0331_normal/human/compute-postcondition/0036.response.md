The value of `ind2` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs` or less, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes the element `queue[ind2 - 1]`.**
