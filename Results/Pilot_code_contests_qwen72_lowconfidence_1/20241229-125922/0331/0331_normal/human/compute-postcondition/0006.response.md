The value of `ind1` is incremented by 1. The values of `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, `rs`, `queue`, `a`, and `ind2` remain unchanged. The condition that `queue[ind1]` is less than `queue[ind2]` may no longer hold, but the conditions that `lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the value of `queue[lf]`, and `ind2` is equal to `ls` are still valid.

Output State: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the value of `queue[lf]`, `ind1` is equal to `lf + 1`, `ind2` is equal to `ls`.**
