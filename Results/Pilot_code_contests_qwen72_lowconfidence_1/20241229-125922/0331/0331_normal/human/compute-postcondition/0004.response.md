Postcondition: **`lf` is a non-negative integer where `lf` <= `rf`, `rf` is a non-negative integer, `ls` is a non-negative integer where `ls` <= `rs`, `rs` is a non-negative integer, `queue` is a list of integers, `a` is an empty list, `ind1` is equal to `lf`, `ind2` is equal to `ls`, and the current value of `queue[ind1]` is less than the current value of `queue[ind2]`.**
