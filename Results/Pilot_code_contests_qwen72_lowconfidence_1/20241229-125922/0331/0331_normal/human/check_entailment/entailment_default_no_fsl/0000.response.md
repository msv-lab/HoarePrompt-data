Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling of `func_1` and `func_2`**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to sort the `queue`, but they are not necessary for the problem. The problem description does not require the tasks to be sorted; it only requires them to be processed in the order they are given. The sorting logic complicates the solution without providing any benefit.

2. **Task Scheduling Logic**: The task scheduling logic is generally correct, but the use of `func_1` and `func_2` introduces unnecessary complexity and potential bugs. Specifically, the recursive calls and merging operations can lead to incorrect states if the queue is not properly managed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases well. For example, if a task arrives at a time when all servers are busy, the task is correctly ignored. However, the recursive sorting and merging can potentially disrupt the order of tasks, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The code can be simplified by removing the unnecessary sorting logic. A simpler approach would be to maintain a list of available servers and update their availability as tasks are scheduled and completed.

Here is a simplified version of the code that should work correctly for the given problem description:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

(n, q) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
available_servers = [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
tasks = []

for i in range(q):
    (tc, k, tp) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    tasks.append((tc, k, tp))

task_results = [-1] * q
server_busy_until = [0] * (n + 1)

for i, (tc, k, tp) in enumerate(tasks):
    free_servers = [j for j in available_servers if server_busy_until[j] <= tc]
    if len(free_servers) >= k:
        chosen_servers = free_servers[:k]
        task_results[i] = sum(chosen_servers)
        for server in chosen_servers:
            server_busy_until[server] = tc + tp

for result in task_results:
    stdout.write(str(result) + '\n')
```

This simplified version directly processes each task in the order they are given, checks for available servers, and updates the server availability accordingly. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for every potential case.
