You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n servers in a laboratory, each of them can perform tasks. Each server has a unique id — integer from 1 to n.

It is known that during the day q tasks will come, the i-th of them is characterized with three integers: ti — the moment in seconds in which the task will come, ki — the number of servers needed to perform it, and di — the time needed to perform this task in seconds. All ti are distinct.

To perform the i-th task you need ki servers which are unoccupied in the second ti. After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next di seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds ti, ti + 1, ..., ti + di - 1. For performing the task, ki servers with the smallest ids will be chosen from all the unoccupied servers. If in the second ti there are not enough unoccupied servers, the task is ignored.

Write the program that determines which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of servers and the number of tasks. 

Next q lines contains three integers each, the i-th line contains integers ti, ki and di (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ n, 1 ≤ di ≤ 1000) — the moment in seconds in which the i-th task will come, the number of servers needed to perform it, and the time needed to perform this task in seconds. The tasks are given in a chronological order and they will come in distinct seconds. 

Output

Print q lines. If the i-th task will be performed by the servers, print in the i-th line the sum of servers' ids on which this task will be performed. Otherwise, print -1.

Note

In the first example in the second 1 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1, 2 and 3 (the sum of the ids equals 6) during two seconds. In the second 2 the second task will come, it will be ignored, because only the server 4 will be unoccupied at that second. In the second 3 the third task will come. By this time, servers with the ids 1, 2 and 3 will be unoccupied again, so the third task will be done on all the servers with the ids 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the sum of the ids is 10).

In the second example in the second 3 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1 and 2 (the sum of the ids is 3) during three seconds. In the second 5 the second task will come, it will be performed on the server 3, because the first two servers will be busy performing the first task.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(l, r):
    if r != l:
        ind = (r + l) // 2
        func_1(l, ind)
        func_1(ind + 1, r)
        func_2(l, ind, ind + 1, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` is a recursive function that takes two non-negative integer parameters `l` and `r` where `l` ≤ `r`. It divides the range `[l, r]` into two halves and recursively calls itself on each half. After the recursive calls, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `l`, `ind`, `ind + 1`, and `r`, where `ind` is the midpoint of the current range. The function does not return any value explicitly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has divided the range `[l, r]` into smaller sub-ranges and performed operations (via `func_2`) on these sub-ranges. The exact nature of these operations is not specified within `func_1` but is left to `func_2`. Edge cases include when `l` equals `r`, in which case no further recursion occurs and `func_2` is not called.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(lf, rf, ls, rs):
    a = []
    ind1 = lf
    ind2 = ls
    while ind1 <= rf and ind2 <= rs:
        if queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]:
            a.append(queue[ind1])
            ind1 += 1
        else:
            a.append(queue[ind2])
            ind2 += 1
    while ind1 <= rf:
        a.append(queue[ind1])
        ind1 += 1
    while ind2 <= rs:
        a.append(queue[ind2])
        ind2 += 1
    for i in range(lf, rs + 1):
        queue[i] = a[i - lf]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes four non-negative integer parameters `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs` (with the constraints `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs`) and a list of integers `queue`. It merges the sublists `queue[lf:rf+1]` and `queue[ls:rs+1]` into a single sorted sublist in non-decreasing order and places the result back into `queue[lf:rs+1]`. The function modifies the `queue` in place and does not return any value. If `lf > rs`, the function does nothing and `queue` remains unchanged.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
