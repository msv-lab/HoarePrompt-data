You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n servers in a laboratory, each of them can perform tasks. Each server has a unique id — integer from 1 to n.

It is known that during the day q tasks will come, the i-th of them is characterized with three integers: ti — the moment in seconds in which the task will come, ki — the number of servers needed to perform it, and di — the time needed to perform this task in seconds. All ti are distinct.

To perform the i-th task you need ki servers which are unoccupied in the second ti. After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next di seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds ti, ti + 1, ..., ti + di - 1. For performing the task, ki servers with the smallest ids will be chosen from all the unoccupied servers. If in the second ti there are not enough unoccupied servers, the task is ignored.

Write the program that determines which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of servers and the number of tasks. 

Next q lines contains three integers each, the i-th line contains integers ti, ki and di (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ n, 1 ≤ di ≤ 1000) — the moment in seconds in which the i-th task will come, the number of servers needed to perform it, and the time needed to perform this task in seconds. The tasks are given in a chronological order and they will come in distinct seconds. 

Output

Print q lines. If the i-th task will be performed by the servers, print in the i-th line the sum of servers' ids on which this task will be performed. Otherwise, print -1.

Note

In the first example in the second 1 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1, 2 and 3 (the sum of the ids equals 6) during two seconds. In the second 2 the second task will come, it will be ignored, because only the server 4 will be unoccupied at that second. In the second 3 the third task will come. By this time, servers with the ids 1, 2 and 3 will be unoccupied again, so the third task will be done on all the servers with the ids 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the sum of the ids is 10).

In the second example in the second 3 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1 and 2 (the sum of the ids is 3) during three seconds. In the second 5 the second task will come, it will be performed on the server 3, because the first two servers will be busy performing the first task.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r):
    if r != l:
        ind = (r + l) // 2
        func_1(l, ind)
        func_1(ind + 1, r)
        func_2(l, ind, ind + 1, r)

#Function 2:
def func_2(lf, rf, ls, rs):
    a = []
    ind1 = lf
    ind2 = ls
    while ind1 <= rf and ind2 <= rs:
        if queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]:
            a.append(queue[ind1])
            ind1 += 1
        else:
            a.append(queue[ind2])
            ind2 += 1
    while ind1 <= rf:
        a.append(queue[ind1])
        ind1 += 1
    while ind2 <= rs:
        a.append(queue[ind2])
        ind2 += 1
    for i in range(lf, rs + 1):
        queue[i] = a[i - lf]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be implementing a merge sort algorithm, which is completely unrelated to the task of scheduling server tasks and determining which tasks will be performed or ignored based on server availability. The program lacks any logic to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement, and it does not include any mechanism to manage server availability or task scheduling. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes four non-negative integer parameters `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs` (with the constraints `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs`) and a list of integers `queue`. It merges the sublists `queue[lf:rf+1]` and `queue[ls:rs+1]` into a single sorted sublist in non-decreasing order and places the result back into `queue[lf:rs+1]`. The function modifies the `queue` in place and does not return any value. If `lf > rs`, the function does nothing and `queue` remains unchanged.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
