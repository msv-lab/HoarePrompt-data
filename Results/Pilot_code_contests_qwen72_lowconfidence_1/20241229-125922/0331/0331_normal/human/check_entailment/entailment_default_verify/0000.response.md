Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not address the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` implement a merge sort algorithm, which is entirely unrelated to the task of scheduling server tasks and determining which tasks will be performed or ignored based on server availability. The program lacks any logic to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement, and it does not include any mechanism to manage server availability or task scheduling. Therefore, the program is incorrect. The output hints provided do not change this conclusion, as they only describe the behavior of the merge sort implementation, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.
