Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be part of a merge sort algorithm, but they do not address the core requirements of the problem, such as managing the availability of servers and scheduling tasks. The code lacks any logic to handle the input tasks, track server availability, or compute the sum of server IDs for tasks that are performed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
