Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the task of scheduling tasks on servers based on the problem description. Specifically, the code has issues with the way it manages the availability of servers and schedules tasks. Here are a few key points where the code fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Server Availability**:
   - The code uses a `deque` named `queue` to manage the tasks and their completion times. However, the way it updates the availability of servers is not consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are not necessary for the problem and do not contribute to the solution. They appear to be part of a merge sort algorithm, which is not relevant to the task scheduling problem.

2. **Incorrect Task Scheduling**:
   - The code checks if the current task can be scheduled by comparing the number of available servers (`cnt + k <= n`). However, it does not correctly update the `used` array to reflect the new state of server availability after scheduling a task.
   - The `used` array is intended to track which servers are busy, but the code does not consistently update this array to reflect the end times of tasks.

3. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The code writes the sum of the server IDs to the output, but it does not handle cases where the task cannot be scheduled correctly. For example, if the task requires more servers than are currently available, the code should output `-1`, but it may not do so correctly due to the issues mentioned above.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where tasks arrive at the same time or where the number of tasks is very large. While the problem guarantees that all `ti` are distinct, the code should still handle large inputs efficiently.

Given these issues, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
