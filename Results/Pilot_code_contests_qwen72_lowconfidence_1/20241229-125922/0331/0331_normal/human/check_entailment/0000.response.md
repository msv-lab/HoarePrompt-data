Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be implementing a merge sort algorithm, which is completely unrelated to the task of scheduling server tasks and determining which tasks will be performed or ignored based on server availability. The program lacks any logic to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement, and it does not include any mechanism to manage server availability or task scheduling. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
