Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program was incorrect because it did not address the core requirements of the problem, such as managing the availability of servers and scheduling tasks. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program does indeed handle these requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of servers (`n`) and the number of tasks (`q`).
   - It initializes a deque `queue` to manage the tasks and a list `used` to track the availability of servers.

2. **Task Processing:**
   - For each task, it reads the task details (`tc`, `k`, `tp`), which represent the time the task arrives, the number of servers required, and the duration of the task.
   - It sorts the `queue` using the merge sort algorithm implemented by `func_1` and `func_2`. This ensures that tasks are processed in the correct order.
   - It then checks and updates the availability of servers by removing tasks that have completed before the current task's arrival time (`tc`).

3. **Server Allocation:**
   - The program checks if there are enough available servers to perform the task.
   - If there are enough servers, it selects the smallest available server IDs, calculates the sum of these IDs, and marks these servers as occupied for the duration of the task.
   - If there are not enough servers, it prints `-1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of the server IDs for each task that is performed or `-1` if the task is ignored.

The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the program correctly manages server availability, schedules tasks, and outputs the required results. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
