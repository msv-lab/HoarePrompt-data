You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n servers in a laboratory, each of them can perform tasks. Each server has a unique id — integer from 1 to n.

It is known that during the day q tasks will come, the i-th of them is characterized with three integers: ti — the moment in seconds in which the task will come, ki — the number of servers needed to perform it, and di — the time needed to perform this task in seconds. All ti are distinct.

To perform the i-th task you need ki servers which are unoccupied in the second ti. After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next di seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds ti, ti + 1, ..., ti + di - 1. For performing the task, ki servers with the smallest ids will be chosen from all the unoccupied servers. If in the second ti there are not enough unoccupied servers, the task is ignored.

Write the program that determines which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of servers and the number of tasks. 

Next q lines contains three integers each, the i-th line contains integers ti, ki and di (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ n, 1 ≤ di ≤ 1000) — the moment in seconds in which the i-th task will come, the number of servers needed to perform it, and the time needed to perform this task in seconds. The tasks are given in a chronological order and they will come in distinct seconds. 

Output

Print q lines. If the i-th task will be performed by the servers, print in the i-th line the sum of servers' ids on which this task will be performed. Otherwise, print -1.

Note

In the first example in the second 1 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1, 2 and 3 (the sum of the ids equals 6) during two seconds. In the second 2 the second task will come, it will be ignored, because only the server 4 will be unoccupied at that second. In the second 3 the third task will come. By this time, servers with the ids 1, 2 and 3 will be unoccupied again, so the third task will be done on all the servers with the ids 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the sum of the ids is 10).

In the second example in the second 3 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1 and 2 (the sum of the ids is 3) during three seconds. In the second 5 the second task will come, it will be performed on the server 3, because the first two servers will be busy performing the first task.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout
from collections import deque

(n, q) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
queue = deque()
cnt = 0
used = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
label = 1
for i in range(q):
    s = set()
    (tc, k, tp) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    if queue:
        func_1(0, len(queue) - 1)
    while queue and tc >= queue[0][0]:
        s.add(queue[0][2])
        cnt -= queue[0][1]
        queue.popleft()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if used[i] in s:
            used[i] = 0
    if cnt + k <= n:
        ans = 0
        value = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not used[i]:
                ans += i
                value += 1
                used[i] = label
            if value == k:
                break
        stdout.write(str(ans) + '\n')
        cnt += k
        queue.append((tc + tp, k, label))
        label += 1
    else:
        stdout.write('-1\n')

#Function 1:

    if (r != l) :
        ind = (r + l) // 2
        func_1(l, ind)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lf, rf, ls, and rs are non-negative integers where lf <= rf and ls <= rs, and queue is a list of integers.

If `ind1` exceeds `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`. If `ind2` exceeds `rs`, all elements from `ind1` to `rf` are appended to `a`.

If `lf > rs`, `queue` remains unchanged.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
