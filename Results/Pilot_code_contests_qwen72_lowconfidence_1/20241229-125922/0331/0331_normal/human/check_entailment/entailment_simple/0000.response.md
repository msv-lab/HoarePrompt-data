### Analysis of the Program

The provided program aims to solve the problem of scheduling tasks on servers based on the constraints given. Let's break down the components and logic to ensure it aligns with the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Input**: 
  - `n` servers, `q` tasks.
  - Each task is described by `ti` (time of arrival), `ki` (number of servers required), and `di` (duration of the task).
- **Output**: 
  - For each task, print the sum of the server IDs used if the task is performed; otherwise, print `-1`.

#### Program Breakdown
1. **Initialization**:
   - Read `n` and `q` from input.
   - Initialize a deque `queue` to manage tasks.
   - Initialize `cnt` to count the number of currently occupied servers.
   - Initialize `used` to track which servers are busy.
   - Initialize `label` to uniquely identify each task.

2. **Processing Each Task**:
   - For each task, read `tc`, `k`, and `tp`.
   - Check if there are any completed tasks in the `queue` and update the `used` array accordingly.
   - If there are enough free servers (`cnt + k <= n`), select the smallest `k` free servers, mark them as used, and add the task to the `queue`.
   - If not enough free servers, print `-1`.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are recursive functions that seem to be part of a merge sort algorithm. However, they are not directly used in the main logic and do not affect the correctness of the task scheduling.

### Correctness Verification
1. **Task Scheduling**:
   - The program correctly processes each task in chronological order.
   - It updates the `used` array to reflect which servers are busy.
   - It selects the smallest `k` free servers for each task and marks them as used.
   - If not enough servers are available, it prints `-1`.

2. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the server IDs used for each task if it is performed.
   - If a task is ignored, it prints `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where tasks arrive in different seconds and require different numbers of servers and durations.
   - It correctly manages the state of servers over time, ensuring that tasks are scheduled only when enough servers are available.

### Conclusion
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly schedules tasks on servers, updates the state of servers, and produces the correct output for each task.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
