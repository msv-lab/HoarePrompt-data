You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n servers in a laboratory, each of them can perform tasks. Each server has a unique id — integer from 1 to n.

It is known that during the day q tasks will come, the i-th of them is characterized with three integers: ti — the moment in seconds in which the task will come, ki — the number of servers needed to perform it, and di — the time needed to perform this task in seconds. All ti are distinct.

To perform the i-th task you need ki servers which are unoccupied in the second ti. After the servers begin to perform the task, each of them will be busy over the next di seconds. Thus, they will be busy in seconds ti, ti + 1, ..., ti + di - 1. For performing the task, ki servers with the smallest ids will be chosen from all the unoccupied servers. If in the second ti there are not enough unoccupied servers, the task is ignored.

Write the program that determines which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of servers and the number of tasks. 

Next q lines contains three integers each, the i-th line contains integers ti, ki and di (1 ≤ ti ≤ 106, 1 ≤ ki ≤ n, 1 ≤ di ≤ 1000) — the moment in seconds in which the i-th task will come, the number of servers needed to perform it, and the time needed to perform this task in seconds. The tasks are given in a chronological order and they will come in distinct seconds. 

Output

Print q lines. If the i-th task will be performed by the servers, print in the i-th line the sum of servers' ids on which this task will be performed. Otherwise, print -1.

Note

In the first example in the second 1 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1, 2 and 3 (the sum of the ids equals 6) during two seconds. In the second 2 the second task will come, it will be ignored, because only the server 4 will be unoccupied at that second. In the second 3 the third task will come. By this time, servers with the ids 1, 2 and 3 will be unoccupied again, so the third task will be done on all the servers with the ids 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the sum of the ids is 10).

In the second example in the second 3 the first task will come, it will be performed on the servers with ids 1 and 2 (the sum of the ids is 3) during three seconds. In the second 5 the second task will come, it will be performed on the server 3, because the first two servers will be busy performing the first task.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are non-negative integers where l <= r.
def func_1(l, r):
    if (r != l) :
        ind = (r + l) // 2
        func_1(l, ind)
        func_1(ind + 1, r)
        func_2(l, ind, ind + 1, r)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` and `r` are non-negative integers where `l` <= `r`. If `r` is not equal to `l`, `ind` is set to `(r + l) // 2`, `func_1(ind + 1, r)` is called, and `func_2(l, ind, ind + 1, r)` is called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is a recursive function that takes two non-negative integer parameters `l` and `r` where `l` ≤ `r`. It divides the range `[l, r]` into two halves and recursively calls itself on each half. After the recursive calls, it calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `l`, `ind`, `ind + 1`, and `r`, where `ind` is the midpoint of the current range. The function does not return any value explicitly. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has divided the range `[l, r]` into smaller sub-ranges and performed operations (via `func_2`) on these sub-ranges. The exact nature of these operations is not specified within `func_1` but is left to `func_2`. Edge cases include when `l` equals `r`, in which case no further recursion occurs and `func_2` is not called.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lf, rf, ls, and rs are non-negative integers where lf <= rf and ls <= rs, and queue is a list of integers.
def func_2(lf, rf, ls, rs):
    a = []
    ind1 = lf
    ind2 = ls
    while ind1 <= rf and ind2 <= rs:
        if queue[ind1] < queue[ind2]:
            a.append(queue[ind1])
            ind1 += 1
        else:
            a.append(queue[ind2])
            ind2 += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `ind1` is either `rf + 1` or less than or equal to `rf`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where either `ind1` exceeds `rf` or `ind2` exceeds `rs`. If `ind1` exceeds `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`. If `ind2` exceeds `rs`, all elements from `ind1` to `rf` are appended to `a`.
    while ind1 <= rf:
        a.append(queue[ind1])
        
        ind1 += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is either `rs + 1` or less than or equal to `rs`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` such that the elements are in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`. If `ind1` exceeded `rf`, all elements from `ind2` to `rs` are appended to `a`.
    while ind2 <= rs:
        a.append(queue[ind2])
        
        ind2 += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes all elements from `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - (rs + 1)) : rs + 1]` which simplifies to `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - ind2_initial) : rs + 1]` where `ind2_initial` is the initial value of `ind2`
    for i in range(lf, rs + 1):
        queue[i] = a[i - lf]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ind1` is `rf + 1`, `ind2` is `rs + 1`, `a` is a list containing elements from `queue` in non-decreasing order up to the point where `ind1` exceeded `rf` or `ind2` exceeded `rs`, and now includes all elements from `queue[rs + 1 - (rs - ind2_initial) : rs + 1]`, `lf` and `rs` remain unchanged, `queue` from index `lf` to `rs` is updated to the corresponding elements from the `a` list. If `lf > rs`, `queue` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes four non-negative integer parameters `lf`, `rf`, `ls`, and `rs` (with the constraints `lf <= rf` and `ls <= rs`) and a list of integers `queue`. It merges the sublists `queue[lf:rf+1]` and `queue[ls:rs+1]` into a single sorted sublist in non-decreasing order and places the result back into `queue[lf:rs+1]`. The function modifies the `queue` in place and does not return any value. If `lf > rs`, the function does nothing and `queue` remains unchanged.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
