Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program is intended to determine which tasks will be performed and which will be ignored based on the availability of servers. However, there is a critical issue with how the program handles the completion of tasks and the updating of server availability.

### Issue:

1. **Server Availability Update:**
   - The program uses a `deque` named `queue` to keep track of tasks and their completion times. When a task is completed, the program updates the `used` array to mark servers as free. This is done using the following code snippet:
     ```python
     while queue and tc >= queue[0][0]:
         s.add(queue[0][2])
         cnt -= queue[0][1]
         queue.popleft()
     for i in range(1, n + 1):
         if used[i] in s:
             used[i] = 0
     ```
   - The issue here is that the program assumes that the `label` of the task (which is used to identify which servers were used for the task) is unique and can be used to reset the `used` array correctly. However, if multiple tasks complete at the same time, the `label` might not uniquely identify the servers used for each task, leading to incorrect server availability updates.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2 2
2 2 2
3 2 2
4 2 2
```

- At `t=1`, the first task comes and uses servers 1 and 2. The `used` array is updated to `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
- At `t=2`, the second task comes and uses servers 3 and 4. The `used` array is updated to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- At `t=3`, the third task comes and uses servers 1 and 2 (since they are still busy until `t=3`). The `used` array is updated to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
- At `t=4`, the fourth task comes and uses servers 3 and 4 (since they are still busy until `t=4`). The `used` array is updated to `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

Now, at `t=3`, both the first and second tasks complete. The program updates the `used` array to `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]` (assuming the `label` uniquely identifies the servers). However, this is incorrect because both tasks used different sets of servers, and the `used` array should be `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

This leads to incorrect server availability, and subsequent tasks may be incorrectly marked as ignored or performed.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle the completion of multiple tasks at the same time, leading to incorrect server availability updates. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
