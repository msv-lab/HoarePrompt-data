Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n integers (a_0, a_1, …, a_{n-1}) where each a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
