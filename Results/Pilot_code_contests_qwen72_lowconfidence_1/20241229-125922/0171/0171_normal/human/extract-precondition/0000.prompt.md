You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).

For any integer k and positive integer n, let kmod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. More formally, r=kmod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that k-r is divisible by n. It always holds that 0≤ kmod n≤ n-1. For example, 100mod 12=4 and (-1337)mod 3=1.

Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1}. Then for each integer k, the guest in room k is moved to room number k+a_{kmod n}.

After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Next 2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 2⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1} (-10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if there is exactly one guest assigned to each room after the shuffling process, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


6
1
14

1 -1
4
5 5 5 1
3
3 2 1
2
0 1
5
-239 -2 -100 -3 -11


Output


YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, every guest is shifted by 14 rooms, so the assignment is still unique.

In the second test case, even guests move to the right by 1 room, and odd guests move to the left by 1 room. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the third test case, every fourth guest moves to the right by 1 room, and the other guests move to the right by 5 rooms. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the fourth test case, guests 0 and 1 are both assigned to room 3.

In the fifth test case, guests 1 and 2 are both assigned to room 2.
