You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).

For any integer k and positive integer n, let kmod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. More formally, r=kmod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that k-r is divisible by n. It always holds that 0≤ kmod n≤ n-1. For example, 100mod 12=4 and (-1337)mod 3=1.

Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1}. Then for each integer k, the guest in room k is moved to room number k+a_{kmod n}.

After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Next 2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 2⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1} (-10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if there is exactly one guest assigned to each room after the shuffling process, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


6
1
14
2
1 -1
4
5 5 5 1
3
3 2 1
2
0 1
5
-239 -2 -100 -3 -11


Output


YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, every guest is shifted by 14 rooms, so the assignment is still unique.

In the second test case, even guests move to the right by 1 room, and odd guests move to the left by 1 room. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the third test case, every fourth guest moves to the right by 1 room, and the other guests move to the right by 5 rooms. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the fourth test case, guests 0 and 1 are both assigned to room 3.

In the fifth test case, guests 1 and 2 are both assigned to room 2.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in xrange(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        seq = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        s = sorted([i + seq[i % n] for i in xrange(2 * n)])
        ans = 'YES'
        for i in xrange(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
