Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the shuffling results in a non-unique assignment of guests to rooms correctly. Specifically, the program uses a range of `2 * n` to generate the list of new room assignments, which may not be sufficient to ensure that all possible room assignments are checked for uniqueness. This can lead to false positives, where the program outputs "YES" even though there might be duplicate assignments.

A more robust approach would be to consider a larger range or a different method to verify the uniqueness of the new room assignments. For example, the program could use a set to track the new room numbers and check for duplicates directly.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
3
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output from the given program:
```
YES
```

In this case, the guests in rooms 0, 1, and 2 are moved to rooms 3, 3, and 2 respectively. This results in two guests being assigned to room 3, but the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not properly check for duplicates within the range of `2 * n`.
