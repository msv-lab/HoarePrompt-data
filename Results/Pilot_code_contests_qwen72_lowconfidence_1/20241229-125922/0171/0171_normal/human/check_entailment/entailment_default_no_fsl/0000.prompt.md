You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).

For any integer k and positive integer n, let kmod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. More formally, r=kmod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that k-r is divisible by n. It always holds that 0≤ kmod n≤ n-1. For example, 100mod 12=4 and (-1337)mod 3=1.

Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1}. Then for each integer k, the guest in room k is moved to room number k+a_{kmod n}.

After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Next 2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 2⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1} (-10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if there is exactly one guest assigned to each room after the shuffling process, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input

1 -1
4
5 5 5 1
3
3 2 1

0 1
5
-239 -2 -100 -3 -11


Output


YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, every guest is shifted by 14 rooms, so the assignment is still unique.

In the second test case, even guests move to the right by 1 room, and odd guests move to the left by 1 room. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the third test case, every fourth guest moves to the right by 1 room, and the other guests move to the right by 5 rooms. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the fourth test case, guests 0 and 1 are both assigned to room 3.

In the fifth test case, guests 1 and 2 are both assigned to room 2.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in xrange(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        seq = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        s = sorted([i + seq[i % n] for i in xrange(2 * n)])
        ans = 'YES'
        for i in xrange(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a new list `s` by adding each element of the list to its index (considering wrap-around using modulo `n`). It then checks if there are any duplicate values in the sorted list `s`. If duplicates are found, the function prints "NO" for that test case; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the results have been printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include handling the maximum limits of `t` and `n`, and ensuring that the input values are within the specified ranges.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
