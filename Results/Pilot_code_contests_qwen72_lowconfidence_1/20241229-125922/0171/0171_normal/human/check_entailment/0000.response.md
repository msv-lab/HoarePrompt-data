Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a potential issue in how it handles the input and processes the sequence. Specifically, the use of `xrange` and `sys.stdin.readline` might cause issues depending on the environment (Python 2 vs. Python 3). However, the primary issue lies in the logic used to check for unique room assignments.

The program constructs a list `s` which contains the new room numbers for the first `2 * n` guests. It then checks if there are any duplicates in this list. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks the first `2 * n` guests, which may not cover all possible room assignments. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3
3 2 1
```
In this case, the program will check the first 6 guests (0 to 5) and their new room assignments. However, the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, and the program should ensure that the shuffling process results in unique assignments for all guests, not just the first `2 * n` guests.

To correctly handle this, the program should check for the uniqueness of the entire infinite sequence, which can be done by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of new room assignments are consistent with the periodic nature of the shuffling.

A correct approach would involve checking if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of new room assignments are all equal to `n`, which would ensure that the shuffling is unique for all guests. The current program does not perform this check, leading to potential false positives.
