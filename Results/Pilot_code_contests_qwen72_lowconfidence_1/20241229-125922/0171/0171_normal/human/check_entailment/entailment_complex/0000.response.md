Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Range for Sequence Calculation**: 
   - The program uses `xrange(2 * n)` to generate the sequence of indices. However, the problem description specifies that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, and the shuffling should be checked for all possible room numbers, not just up to `2 * n`. Using `2 * n` is insufficient to cover the infinite nature of the hotel's rooms.

2. **Incorrect Shuffling Logic**:
   - The program calculates the new room number for each guest using `i + seq[i % n]` and then sorts these new room numbers to check for duplicates. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the infinite nature of the hotel. Specifically, the problem requires checking if the shuffling process results in exactly one guest per room, but the current implementation only checks a finite subset of rooms (up to `2 * n`).

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program uses `i + seq[i % n]` to calculate the new room number. While this is mathematically correct for the modulo operation, it does not account for the possibility of negative shifts, which could result in guests being moved to rooms outside the range of `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the shifts might cause guests to move to the same room, especially in cases where the shifts are large enough to wrap around multiple times.

To meet the problem description correctly, the program should:
- Use a more comprehensive approach to simulate the infinite nature of the hotel.
- Ensure that the shuffling process is correctly applied to all possible room numbers, not just a finite subset.
- Check for conflicts in the new room assignments to ensure that no two guests end up in the same room.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, hence it is incorrect.
