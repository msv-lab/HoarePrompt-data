You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Hilbert's Hotel is a very unusual hotel since the number of rooms is infinite! In fact, there is exactly one room for every integer, including zero and negative integers. Even stranger, the hotel is currently at full capacity, meaning there is exactly one guest in every room. The hotel's manager, David Hilbert himself, decides he wants to shuffle the guests around because he thinks this will create a vacancy (a room without a guest).

For any integer k and positive integer n, let kmod n denote the remainder when k is divided by n. More formally, r=kmod n is the smallest non-negative integer such that k-r is divisible by n. It always holds that 0≤ kmod n≤ n-1. For example, 100mod 12=4 and (-1337)mod 3=1.

Then the shuffling works as follows. There is an array of n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1}. Then for each integer k, the guest in room k is moved to room number k+a_{kmod n}.

After this shuffling process, determine if there is still exactly one guest assigned to each room. That is, there are no vacancies or rooms with multiple guests.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Next 2t lines contain descriptions of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 2⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_0,a_1,…,a_{n-1} (-10^9≤ a_i≤ 10^9).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10^5.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if there is exactly one guest assigned to each room after the shuffling process, or "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input

1
14
2
1 -1
4
5 5 5 1
3
3 2 1
2
0 1
5
-239 -2 -100 -3 -11


Output


YES
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

Note

In the first test case, every guest is shifted by 14 rooms, so the assignment is still unique.

In the second test case, even guests move to the right by 1 room, and odd guests move to the left by 1 room. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the third test case, every fourth guest moves to the right by 1 room, and the other guests move to the right by 5 rooms. We can show that the assignment is still unique.

In the fourth test case, guests 0 and 1 are both assigned to room 3.

In the fifth test case, guests 1 and 2 are both assigned to room 2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n integers (a_0, a_1, …, a_{n-1}) where each a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    for _ in xrange(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        seq = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        s = sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in xrange(2 * n)])
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        for i in xrange(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, for each test case, `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 * n elements, `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO', and the value of `ans` has been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a new list `s` by adding each element of the list to its index (considering wrap-around using modulo `n`). It then checks if there are any duplicate values in the sorted list `s`. If duplicates are found, the function prints "NO" for that test case; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the results have been printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include handling the maximum limits of `t` and `n`, and ensuring that the input values are within the specified ranges.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
