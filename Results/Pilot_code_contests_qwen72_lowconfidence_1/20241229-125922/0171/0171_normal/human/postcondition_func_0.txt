The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function computes a new list `s` by adding each element of the list to its index (considering wrap-around using modulo `n`). It then checks if there are any duplicate values in the sorted list `s`. If duplicates are found, the function prints "NO" for that test case; otherwise, it prints "YES". The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The state after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the results have been printed to standard output. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include handling the maximum limits of `t` and `n`, and ensuring that the input values are within the specified ranges.
