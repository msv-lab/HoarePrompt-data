t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}) where each a_i is an integer (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
