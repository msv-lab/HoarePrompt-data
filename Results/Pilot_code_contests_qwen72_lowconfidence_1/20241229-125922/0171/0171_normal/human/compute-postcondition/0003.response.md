The code snippet reads a line from the standard input, splits it into parts based on spaces, and then converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in a list called `seq`.

- `seq` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input string split by spaces.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the input, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces**.
