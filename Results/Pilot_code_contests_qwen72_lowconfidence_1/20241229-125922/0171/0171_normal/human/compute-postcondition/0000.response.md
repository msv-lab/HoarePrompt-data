The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` reassigns the built-in `input` function to be equivalent to `sys.stdin.readline`. This means that any subsequent calls to `input()` will actually call `sys.stdin.readline()`, which reads a line from standard input.

The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer, and each test case includes an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. However, the provided code snippet only changes how input is handled and does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the new assignment for `input`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n integers (a_0, a_1, …, a_{n-1}) where each a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `input` is now assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.**
