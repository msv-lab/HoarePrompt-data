The code snippet provided assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. This overrides the previous conditional assignment of `ans` which was dependent on the comparison `s[3] != s[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is 'NO'**.
