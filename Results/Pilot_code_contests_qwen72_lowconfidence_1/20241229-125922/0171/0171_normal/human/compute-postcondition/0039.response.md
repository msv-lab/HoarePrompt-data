To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1.
- `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces.
- `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ans` is 'YES'.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in xrange(1, len(s)):
    if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
        ans = 'NO'
        break
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `s` starting from 1 to `len(s) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if the current element `s[i]` is equal to the previous element `s[i - 1]`.
   - If a duplicate is found, `ans` is set to 'NO' and the loop breaks immediately.
   - If no duplicates are found, the loop completes all iterations.

2. **Output State**:
   - If the loop finds any duplicate elements in `s`, `ans` will be 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, `ans` will remain 'YES'.
   - The loop will always execute at least once because `s` must have at least 2 elements.
   - The value of `i` will be the last index checked in the loop, which is `len(s) - 1` if no duplicates are found, or the index where the first duplicate was found if a duplicate is found.

### Final Output State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.
- `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1.
- `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces.
- `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'.
- `i` is the last index checked in the loop, which is either `len(s) - 1` if no duplicates are found, or the index where the first duplicate was found if a duplicate is found.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO', `i` is the last index checked in the loop, which is either `len(s) - 1` if no duplicates are found, or the index where the first duplicate was found if a duplicate is found.**
