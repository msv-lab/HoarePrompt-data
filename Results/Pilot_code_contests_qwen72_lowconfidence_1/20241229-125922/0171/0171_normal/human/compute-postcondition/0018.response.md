Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3. If `s[3] == s[2]`, `ans` is set to 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
