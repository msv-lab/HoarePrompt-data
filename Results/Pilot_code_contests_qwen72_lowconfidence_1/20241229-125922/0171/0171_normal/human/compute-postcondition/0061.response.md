Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, for each test case, `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 * n elements, `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO', and the value of `ans` has been printed for each test case.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- `input` is still assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 1.
  - `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.
  - `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 * n elements.
  - `ans` is determined as 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, and 'NO' if there are duplicates.
  - The value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are changed or printed. However, since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will always execute at least once.
