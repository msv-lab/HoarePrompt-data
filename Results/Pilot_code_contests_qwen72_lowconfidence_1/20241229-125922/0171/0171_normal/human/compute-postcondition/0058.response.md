Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `ans` is 'NO' if `s[i] == s[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 'YES'.***
