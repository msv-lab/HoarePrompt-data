Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 'YES', `i` is 1, and the second element of `s` (`s[1]`) is equal to the first element of `s` (`s[0]`).**
