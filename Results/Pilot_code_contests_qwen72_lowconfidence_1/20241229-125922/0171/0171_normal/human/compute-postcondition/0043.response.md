The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `seq`. Let's go through the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The variable `input` is already defined as `sys.stdin.readline`, which means it reads a line from standard input.
2. **Splitting and Conversion**: The line read from input is split by spaces, and each element is converted to an integer.
3. **Assignment to `seq`**: The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `seq`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1
- `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces
- `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements
- `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'
- `i` is 0 (or the appropriate starting index for the new `s`)

After executing the code snippet:
- `seq` is updated to a new list of integers from the input.

The values of `t`, `input`, `n`, `s`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0 (or the appropriate starting index for the new `s`).**
