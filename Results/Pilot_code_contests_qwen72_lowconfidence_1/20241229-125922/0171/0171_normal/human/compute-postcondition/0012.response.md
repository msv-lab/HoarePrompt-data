The code snippet changes the value of the variable `ans` from 'YES' to 'NO'. All other variables (`t`, `input`, `n`, `seq`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 2.**
