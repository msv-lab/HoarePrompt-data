To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array `a` of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
- `input` is now assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in xrange(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The loop reads the number of test cases `t` from the input using `int(input())`. This means `input()` must return a string that can be converted to an integer.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is a positive integer. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
3. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop's execution.

### Adjusted States:
- **`t` must be a positive integer**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
- **`input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`**: This ensures that `input()` reads a line from standard input, which should contain the value of `t`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, and the input must provide a valid integer for `t`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
