To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to continue:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the `for _ in xrange(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`.
   - `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1.
   - `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces.
   - `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO'.
   - `i` is the last index checked in the loop, which is either `len(s) - 1` if no duplicates are found, or the index where the first duplicate was found if a duplicate is found.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there are more test cases to process. This is determined by the value of `t` (the number of test cases).
   - After each iteration, the loop should prepare for the next test case by reading new input values for `n` and `seq`, and then computing a new `s` and `ans`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `n` should be read from the new input.
   - `seq` should be a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces.
   - `s` should be recomputed as a new sorted list based on the new `n` and `seq`.
   - `ans` should be recalculated based on the new `s`.
   - `i` should be reset to 0 or the appropriate starting index for the new `s`.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the new input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the new input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 'YES' if no duplicates are found in `s`, otherwise `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0 (or the appropriate starting index for the new `s`).**
