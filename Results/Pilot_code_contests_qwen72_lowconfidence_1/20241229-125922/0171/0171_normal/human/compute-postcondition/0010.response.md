Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is the integer read from the input and must be at least 1, `seq` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 'YES', `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
