The code snippet provided changes the value of the variable `ans` from its initial state to 'NO'. The values of other variables (`t`, `input`, `n`, `seq`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this particular line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `input` is assigned to `sys.stdin.readline`, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `seq` is a new list of integers from the input split by spaces, `s` is a new sorted list of integers computed as `sorted([(i + seq[i % n]) for i in range(2 * n)])` and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is 'NO'.**
