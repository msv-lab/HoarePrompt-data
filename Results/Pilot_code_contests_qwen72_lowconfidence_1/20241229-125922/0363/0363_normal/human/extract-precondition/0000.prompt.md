You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Shaass has decided to hunt some birds. There are n horizontal electricity wires aligned parallel to each other. Wires are numbered 1 to n from top to bottom. On each wire there are some oskols sitting next to each other. Oskol is the name of a delicious kind of birds in Shaass's territory. Supposed there are ai oskols sitting on the i-th wire.

<image>

Sometimes Shaass shots one of the birds and the bird dies (suppose that this bird sat at the i-th wire). Consequently all the birds on the i-th wire to the left of the dead bird get scared and jump up on the wire number i - 1, if there exists no upper wire they fly away. Also all the birds to the right of the dead bird jump down on wire number i + 1, if there exists no such wire they fly away. 

Shaass has shot m birds. You're given the initial number of birds on each wire, tell him how many birds are sitting on each wire after the shots.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next line contains a list of space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an, (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100). 

The third line contains an integer m, (0 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains two integers xi and yi. The integers mean that for the i-th time Shaass shoot the yi-th (from left) bird on the xi-th wire, (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 1 ≤ yi). It's guaranteed there will be at least yi birds on the xi-th wire at that moment.

Output

On the i-th line of the output print the number of birds on the i-th wire.
