p1 and p2 are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer representing the coordinate of a city and a string representing the city's type ('B' for Byteland, 'R' for Berland, 'P' for disputed), and a1 is an integer representing the total number of cities. Both p1 and p2 are sorted by the city coordinates in ascending order, and they contain the same set of cities but may be structured differently (e.g., p1 could contain all cities while p2 contains only disputed cities or vice versa). The length of p1 and p2 is equal to a1, and all cities have distinct coordinates.
