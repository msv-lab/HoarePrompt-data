Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description in several key aspects:

1. **Handling Disputed Cities**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost of connecting cities by considering the distance between consecutive disputed cities and the cities around them. However, it fails to ensure that the connections made maintain the connectivity for both Byteland and Berland, including the disputed cities, as required by the problem.

2. **Connectivity Requirements**:
   - The problem requires that both sets of cities (Byteland and disputed, Berland and disputed) must be connected. The program's logic for calculating the minimum cost does not guarantee that these connectivity requirements are met. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates distances but does not ensure that the connections form a valid spanning tree for both sets of cities.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if there are no disputed cities, the program should still ensure that all Byteland and Berland cities are connected among themselves. The current implementation might fail to correctly handle such scenarios.

4. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
   - The program uses a complex method to calculate distances, which may not always yield the correct minimum cost. The use of `L` and `R` arrays to calculate minimum distances might lead to incorrect results in some cases, especially when the distribution of cities is uneven.

5. **Redundant Calculations**:
   - The program recalculates distances and minimums multiple times, which can lead to inefficiencies and potential errors. A more straightforward approach would be to use a greedy algorithm or a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm to ensure the correct connections are made.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, a more reliable approach would be to use a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Here's a high-level outline of a correct solution:

1. **Create Graph**:
   - Create a graph where each city is a node, and edges represent the distances between cities.

2. **Add Edges**:
   - Add edges between consecutive cities (both disputed and non-disputed) to ensure connectivity.

3. **Kruskal's Algorithm**:
   - Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST for both sets of cities (Byteland and disputed, Berland and disputed). Ensure that the MST includes all necessary connections to maintain connectivity.

4. **Calculate Total Cost**:
   - Sum the weights of the edges in the MST to get the minimum total cost.

By using a more structured and well-known algorithm like Kruskal's, the program can ensure that it meets the connectivity requirements and calculates the correct minimum cost.

Therefore, the provided program is **incorrect** because it does not guarantee the required connectivity and may produce incorrect results in various scenarios.
