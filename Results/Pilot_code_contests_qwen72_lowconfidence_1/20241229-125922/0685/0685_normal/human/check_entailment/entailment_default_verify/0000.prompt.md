You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The cities of Byteland and Berland are located on the axis Ox. In addition, on this axis there are also disputed cities, which belong to each of the countries in their opinion. Thus, on the line Ox there are three types of cities:

  * the cities of Byteland, 
  * the cities of Berland, 
  * disputed cities. 



Recently, the project BNET has been launched — a computer network of a new generation. Now the task of the both countries is to connect the cities so that the network of this country is connected.

The countries agreed to connect the pairs of cities with BNET cables in such a way that:

  * If you look at the only cities of Byteland and the disputed cities, then in the resulting set of cities, any city should be reachable from any other one by one or more cables, 
  * If you look at the only cities of Berland and the disputed cities, then in the resulting set of cities, any city should be reachable from any other one by one or more cables. 



Thus, it is necessary to choose a set of pairs of cities to connect by cables in such a way that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Cables allow bi-directional data transfer. Each cable connects exactly two distinct cities.

The cost of laying a cable from one city to another is equal to the distance between them. Find the minimum total cost of laying a set of cables so that two subsets of cities (Byteland and disputed cities, Berland and disputed cities) are connected.

Each city is a point on the line Ox. It is technically possible to connect the cities a and b with a cable so that the city c (a < c < b) is not connected to this cable, where a, b and c are simultaneously coordinates of the cities a, b and c.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of cities.

The following n lines contains an integer x_i and the letter c_i (-10^{9} ≤ x_i ≤ 10^{9}) — the coordinate of the city and its type. If the city belongs to Byteland, c_i equals to 'B'. If the city belongs to Berland, c_i equals to «R». If the city is disputed, c_i equals to 'P'. 

All cities have distinct coordinates. Guaranteed, that the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.

Output

Print the minimal total length of such set of cables, that if we delete all Berland cities (c_i='R'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables. Similarly, if we delete all Byteland cities (c_i='B'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables.

Examples

Input

4
-5 R
0 P
3 P
7 B


Output

12


Input

5
10 R
14 B
16 B
21 R
32 R


Output

24

Note

In the first example, you should connect the first city with the second, the second with the third, and the third with the fourth. The total length of the cables will be 5 + 3 + 4 = 12.

In the second example there are no disputed cities, so you need to connect all the neighboring cities of Byteland and all the neighboring cities of Berland. The cities of Berland have coordinates 10, 21, 32, so to connect them you need two cables of length 11 and 11. The cities of Byteland have coordinates 14 and 16, so to connect them you need one cable of length 2. Thus, the total length of all cables is 11 + 11 + 2 = 24.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem of connecting the cities in such a way that both the Byteland and Berland subsets (including disputed cities) are connected with the minimum total cost. The program considers the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: It reads the input and stores the coordinates and types of the cities.
2. **Handling Disputed Cities**: It identifies the first and last disputed cities and calculates the cost of connecting these disputed cities to ensure they form a continuous segment.
3. **Connecting Non-Disputed Cities**:
   - It connects all cities of Byteland and Berland within the segment before the first disputed city.
   - It connects all cities of Byteland and Berland within the segment after the last disputed city.
   - It ensures that the first and last disputed cities are connected to the nearest Byteland and Berland cities, respectively.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For segments without disputed cities, it directly connects adjacent Byteland and Berland cities.
   - For segments with disputed cities, it uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of connecting the cities in the segment, considering both direct connections and connections through the disputed cities.

The program handles edge cases such as:
- No disputed cities.
- Only one disputed city.
- Disputed cities at the beginning or end of the list.
- Multiple segments of cities separated by gaps.

Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of various scenarios, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `p1` and `p2`, which are tuples representing the coordinates and types of two cities, and `a1`, which is a list of city tuples. Each city tuple is structured as `(coordinate, type)`, where `coordinate` is an integer and `type` is a character ('B', 'R', or 'P'). The function calculates and returns the minimum value between two computed values, `ans1` and `ans2`.

- `ans1` is always calculated as \(2 \times (p2[0] - p1[0])\), which represents twice the distance between the coordinates of `p1` and `p2`.

- `ans2` is initially set to the distance between `p1` and `p2` (`p2[0] - p1[0]`). This value is then adjusted based on the presence of cities of type 'R' and 'B' in the list `a1`.

  - If there are cities of type 'R' in `a1`, the function calculates the minimum distance sum for these cities and adds it to `ans2`.
  - Similarly, if there are cities of type 'B' in `a1`, the function calculates the minimum distance sum for these cities and adds it to `ans2`.

The function returns the smaller of `ans1` and the adjusted `ans2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
