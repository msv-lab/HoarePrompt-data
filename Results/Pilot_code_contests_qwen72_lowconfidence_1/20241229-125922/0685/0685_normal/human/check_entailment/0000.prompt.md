You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The cities of Byteland and Berland are located on the axis Ox. In addition, on this axis there are also disputed cities, which belong to each of the countries in their opinion. Thus, on the line Ox there are three types of cities:

  * the cities of Byteland, 
  * the cities of Berland, 
  * disputed cities. 



Recently, the project BNET has been launched — a computer network of a new generation. Now the task of the both countries is to connect the cities so that the network of this country is connected.

The countries agreed to connect the pairs of cities with BNET cables in such a way that:

  * If you look at the only cities of Byteland and the disputed cities, then in the resulting set of cities, any city should be reachable from any other one by one or more cables, 
  * If you look at the only cities of Berland and the disputed cities, then in the resulting set of cities, any city should be reachable from any other one by one or more cables. 



Thus, it is necessary to choose a set of pairs of cities to connect by cables in such a way that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Cables allow bi-directional data transfer. Each cable connects exactly two distinct cities.

The cost of laying a cable from one city to another is equal to the distance between them. Find the minimum total cost of laying a set of cables so that two subsets of cities (Byteland and disputed cities, Berland and disputed cities) are connected.

Each city is a point on the line Ox. It is technically possible to connect the cities a and b with a cable so that the city c (a < c < b) is not connected to this cable, where a, b and c are simultaneously coordinates of the cities a, b and c.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of cities.

The following n lines contains an integer x_i and the letter c_i (-10^{9} ≤ x_i ≤ 10^{9}) — the coordinate of the city and its type. If the city belongs to Byteland, c_i equals to 'B'. If the city belongs to Berland, c_i equals to «R». If the city is disputed, c_i equals to 'P'. 

All cities have distinct coordinates. Guaranteed, that the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.

Output

Print the minimal total length of such set of cables, that if we delete all Berland cities (c_i='R'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables. Similarly, if we delete all Byteland cities (c_i='B'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables.

Examples

Input

4
-5 R
0 P
3 P
7 B


Output

12


Input

5
10 R
14 B
16 B
21 R
32 R


Output

24

Note

In the first example, you should connect the first city with the second, the second with the third, and the third with the fourth. The total length of the cables will be 5 + 3 + 4 = 12.

In the second example there are no disputed cities, so you need to connect all the neighboring cities of Byteland and all the neighboring cities of Berland. The cities of Berland have coordinates 10, 21, 32, so to connect them you need two cables of length 11 and 11. The cities of Byteland have coordinates 14 and 16, so to connect them you need one cable of length 2. Thus, the total length of all cables is 11 + 11 + 2 = 24.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
