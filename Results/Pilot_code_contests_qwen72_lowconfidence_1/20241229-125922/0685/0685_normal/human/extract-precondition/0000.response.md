Precondition: **p1 and p2 are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, where each tuple is structured as (x_i, c_i), x_i is an integer representing the coordinate of the city, and c_i is a character ('B', 'R', or 'P') indicating the type of the city (Byteland, Berland, or disputed, respectively). a1 is an integer representing the number of cities, such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. All x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.**
