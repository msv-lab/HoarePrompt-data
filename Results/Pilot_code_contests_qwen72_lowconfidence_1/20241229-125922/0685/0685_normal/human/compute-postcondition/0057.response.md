The code appends a new element to the list `L`. This new element is calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1] + L[-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 1.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.
- `i` is 2.

Step-by-step impact:
1. The current value of `i` is 2.
2. `b[i] - b[i - 1]` calculates the difference between the third element and the second element of `b`.
3. `L[-1]` refers to the last element of `L`, which is `b[1] - p1`.
4. The new element to be appended to `L` is `b[2] - b[1] + (b[1] - p1)`.

Let's calculate the new element:
- `b[2] - b[1]` is the difference between the third and second elements of `b`.
- `b[1] - p1` is the last element of `L`.
- The new element is `b[2] - b[1] + (b[1] - p1)`, which simplifies to `b[2] - p1`.

Therefore, the new value of `L` will be `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, b[2] - p1]`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 1, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, b[2] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`, `i` is 2**.
