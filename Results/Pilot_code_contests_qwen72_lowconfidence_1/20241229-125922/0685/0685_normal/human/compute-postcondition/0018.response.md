The code snippet `b.append(i[0])` attempts to append the first element of the object `i` to the list `b`. However, the initial state specifies that `i` is an integer (specifically, `i` is 2). Since an integer does not support indexing, this operation will raise a `TypeError`.

Given the error, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the occurrence of the error.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B'. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'B', `b` also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'R', an error occurs due to attempting to index an integer. `i` is 2. An error occurred due to attempting to index an integer.**
