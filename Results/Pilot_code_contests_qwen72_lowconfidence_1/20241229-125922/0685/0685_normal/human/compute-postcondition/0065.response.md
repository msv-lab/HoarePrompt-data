To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is at least 2.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3]]`.
- `i` is `len(b) - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(b) - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(b) - 1` to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(b) - 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `len(b) - 3`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be `len(b) - 3` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is at least 2, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3]]`, `i` is `len(b) - 3`**
