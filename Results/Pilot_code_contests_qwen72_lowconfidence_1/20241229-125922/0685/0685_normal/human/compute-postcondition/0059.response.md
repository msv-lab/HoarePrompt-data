The code appends a new element to the list `L`. This new element is calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1] + L[-1]`. Given that `i` is 3, we can substitute `i` with 3 in the expression:

- `b[i]` becomes `b[3]`
- `b[i - 1]` becomes `b[2]`
- `L[-1]` is the last element of `L`, which is `b[2] - p1`

Thus, the new element appended to `L` is:

\[ b[3] - b[2] + (b[2] - p1) \]

Simplifying this:

\[ b[3] - p1 \]

Therefore, the new element appended to `L` is `b[3] - p1`.

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, along with the updated value of `L`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 3, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, b[2] - p1, b[3] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`, `i` is 3**.
