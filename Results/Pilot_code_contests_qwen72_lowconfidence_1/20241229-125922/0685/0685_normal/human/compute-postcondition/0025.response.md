The code snippet `L = [r[0] - p1]` initializes a new list `L` with a single element, which is the result of subtracting `p1` from the first element of the list `r`. Here's the updated state:

- `L` is now a list with one element, which is the result of `r[0] - p1`.
- All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `r`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R', `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'. The length of the list `r` is greater than 0. `L` is `[r[0] - p1]`.**
