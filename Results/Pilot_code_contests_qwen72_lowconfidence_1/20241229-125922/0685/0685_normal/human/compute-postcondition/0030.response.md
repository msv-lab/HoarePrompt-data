The provided code appends a new element to the list `L`. This new element is calculated as `r[i] - r[i - 1] + L[-1]`.

Given:
- `L` is initially `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1]`.
- `i` is 2.

The new element to be appended to `L` is:
- `r[2] - r[1] + L[-1]`

Since `L[-1]` is the last element of `L`, which is `r[1] - p1`, the calculation becomes:
- `r[2] - r[1] + (r[1] - p1)`

Simplifying this:
- `r[2] - r[1] + r[1] - p1 = r[2] - p1`

Therefore, the new element to be appended to `L` is `r[2] - p1`.

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `L` is now `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`.
- All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `r`, `b`, `R`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is 2**.
