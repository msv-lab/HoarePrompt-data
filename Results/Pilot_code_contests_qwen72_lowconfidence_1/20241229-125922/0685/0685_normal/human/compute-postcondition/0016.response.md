To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All `x_i` are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is 0.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B'.
- If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'B', `b` also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`.
- If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'R', an error occurs due to attempting to index an integer.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in a1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range defined by `a1`. Since `a1` is an integer, the loop will iterate from 0 to `a1 - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `r`, `b`) do not change based on the loop condition alone. They remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B'. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'B', `b` also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'R', an error occurs due to attempting to index an integer. `i` is 2.**
