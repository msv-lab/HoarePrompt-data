The code snippet modifies the list `R` by appending a new element calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1] + R[-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is at least 2.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2]]`.
- `i` is `len(b) - 2`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `R.append(b[i] - b[i - 1] + R[-1])`:
   - `R[-1]` is the last element of `R`, which is `p2 - b[len(b) - 2]`.
   - `b[i]` is `b[len(b) - 2]`.
   - `b[i - 1]` is `b[len(b) - 3]`.

Therefore, the new element added to `R` is:
\[ b[len(b) - 2] - b[len(b) - 3] + (p2 - b[len(b) - 2]) \]
Simplifying this:
\[ p2 - b[len(b) - 3] \]

So, the new element appended to `R` is `p2 - b[len(b) - 3]`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is at least 2, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3]]`, `i` is `len(b) - 2`**.
