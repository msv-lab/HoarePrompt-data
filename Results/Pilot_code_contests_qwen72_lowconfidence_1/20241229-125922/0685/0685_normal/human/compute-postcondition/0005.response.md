The code attempts to append the first element of `i` (which is supposed to be a tuple or list) to the list `r`. However, since `i` is given as an integer (0), this operation will result in a TypeError because an integer does not support indexing.

Given the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the code provided. Assuming the intention was to append the coordinate of the city at index `i` to the list `r`, the correct code would be:

```python
r.append(p1[i][0])
```

However, with the given code and the initial state, the following is the output state considering the error:

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the type of the city at index `i` is 'R'. A TypeError occurs due to attempting to index an integer.**
