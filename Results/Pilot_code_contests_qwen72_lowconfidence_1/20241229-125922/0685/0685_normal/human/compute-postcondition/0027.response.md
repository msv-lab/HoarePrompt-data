To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1).
- `ans2` is p2 - p1.
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R'.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- The length of the list `r` is greater than 0.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(r)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(1, len(r))` generates at least one value. This means `len(r)` must be greater than 1.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `r` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `r` has at least 2 elements.
- Initialize `i` to 1.

### Final State:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is 1**
