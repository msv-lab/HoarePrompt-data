The code appends a new element to the list `R`. This new element is calculated as `r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 4 elements.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2], p2 - r[len(r) - 3]]`.
- `i` is `len(r) - 3`.

The new element appended to `R` is:
\[ \text{new\_element} = r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1] \]

Since `i` is `len(r) - 3`, the calculation becomes:
\[ \text{new\_element} = r[\text{len}(r) - 3] - r[\text{len}(r) - 4] + R[-1] \]

Therefore, the updated `R` list is:
\[ R = [p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[\text{len}(r) - 2], p2 - r[\text{len}(r) - 3], r[\text{len}(r) - 3] - r[\text{len}(r) - 4] + R[-1]] \]

All other variables remain unchanged.
