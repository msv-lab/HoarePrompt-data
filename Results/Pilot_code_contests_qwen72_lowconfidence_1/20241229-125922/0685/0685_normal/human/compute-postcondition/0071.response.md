To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 1.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.
- `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - b[0]`, and `b[0] - p1 + p2 - b[2]`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(b) - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b) - 1`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - The length of `b` is greater than 1, so `len(b) - 1` is at least 1.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
- **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `i < len(b) - 1`. Given that `i` is now 1, the loop will execute again if `len(b) - 1` is greater than 1.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 1.
- The length of `b` is greater than 1, so `len(b) - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `len(b) - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `len(b)` must be at least 3.

### Final State:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 2, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`, `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - b[0]`, and `b[0] - p1 + p2 - b[2]`, `i` is 1**
