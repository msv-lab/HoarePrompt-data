To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(len(r) - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `len(r) - 1`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i > 0`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start at a value greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `len(r) - 1` must be greater than 0, which implies `len(r) > 1`.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - The initial state provided includes the fact that `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element.
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust this to ensure `r` has at least 2 elements.

### Adjusted State:

- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.
- `i` is initialized to `len(r) - 1`.

### Final State:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\), `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is `len(r) - 1`**
