Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `p1` and `p2`, which are tuples representing the coordinates and types of two cities, and `a1`, which is a list of city tuples. Each city tuple is structured as `(coordinate, type)`, where `coordinate` is an integer and `type` is a character ('B', 'R', or 'P'). The function calculates and returns the minimum value between two computed values, `ans1` and `ans2`.

- `ans1` is always calculated as \(2 \times (p2[0] - p1[0])\), which represents twice the distance between the coordinates of `p1` and `p2`.

- `ans2` is initially set to the distance between `p1` and `p2` (`p2[0] - p1[0]`). This value is then adjusted based on the presence of cities of type 'R' and 'B' in the list `a1`.

  - If there are cities of type 'R' in `a1`, the function calculates the minimum distance sum for these cities and adds it to `ans2`.
  - Similarly, if there are cities of type 'B' in `a1`, the function calculates the minimum distance sum for these cities and adds it to `ans2`.

The function returns the smaller of `ans1` and the adjusted `ans2`.

**Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- The function assumes that `p1` and `p2` are valid tuples with at least one element, and that `a1` is a list of valid city tuples.
- If `a1` is empty, `ans2` will remain as the initial distance between `p1` and `p2`.
- If `a1` contains only cities of type 'P', `ans2` will also remain as the initial distance between `p1` and `p2`.
- The function does not handle cases where `p1` or `p2` are not valid tuples or where `a1` contains invalid city tuples.
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where `p1` and `p2` have the same coordinate, although the calculations would still be valid in this case. **

Final State:
- The function returns the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `ans1` is always \(2 \times (p2[0] - p1[0])\).
- `ans2` is the initial distance between `p1` and `p2` plus any additional distance sums calculated for cities of type 'R' and 'B' in `a1`.
- The original parameters `p1`, `p2`, and `a1` remain unchanged. **
