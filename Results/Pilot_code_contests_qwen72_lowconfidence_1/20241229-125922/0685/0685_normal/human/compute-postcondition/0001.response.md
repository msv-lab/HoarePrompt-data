The code initializes an empty list `r`. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes all the initial conditions plus the new initialization of `r`.

Output State: **p1 and p2 are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, a1 is an integer representing the number of cities, such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, ans1 is 0, r is an empty list.**
