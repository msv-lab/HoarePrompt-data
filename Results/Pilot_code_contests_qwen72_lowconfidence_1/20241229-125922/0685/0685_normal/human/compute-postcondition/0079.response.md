The function `func_1` accepts three parameters:

- `p1`: A tuple representing the coordinates and type of the first city, structured as (x_1, c_1), where x_1 is an integer representing the coordinate of the city, and c_1 is a character ('B', 'R', or 'P') indicating the type of the city.
- `p2`: A tuple representing the coordinates and type of the second city, structured as (x_2, c_2), where x_2 is an integer representing the coordinate of the city, and c_2 is a character ('B', 'R', or 'P') indicating the type of the city.
- `a1`: An integer representing the number of cities, such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. All x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.

The function returns the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where:
- `ans1` is calculated as \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is calculated as \(p2 - p1 + 2 \times \text{min1}\) if `b` is not empty. If `b` is empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\). Here, `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - b[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(b) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(b) - 2`. `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]` and `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two city tuples `p1` and `p2`, and an integer `a1` representing the number of cities. It returns the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), and `ans2` is calculated based on the presence of a list `b` and specific conditions involving the distances and coordinates of the cities.**
