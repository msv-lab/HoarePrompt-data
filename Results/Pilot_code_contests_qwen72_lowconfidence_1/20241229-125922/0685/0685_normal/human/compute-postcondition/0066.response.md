The code snippet `R.append(b[i] - b[i - 1] + R[-1])` appends a new element to the list `R`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the elements `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`, added to the last element of `R`.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is at least 2.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3]]`.
- `i` is `len(b) - 3`.

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. **Calculation of the New Element:**
   - `b[i]` is `b[len(b) - 3]`.
   - `b[i - 1]` is `b[len(b) - 4]`.
   - `R[-1]` is the last element of `R`, which is `p2 - b[len(b) - 3]`.

2. **Appending to `R`:**
   - The new element appended to `R` is `b[len(b) - 3] - b[len(b) - 4] + (p2 - b[len(b) - 3])`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `p2 - b[len(b) - 4]`.

Therefore, the updated `R` is:
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3], p2 - b[len(b) - 4]]`.

The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the updated `R` list.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is at least 2, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[len(b) - 2], p2 - b[len(b) - 3], p2 - b[len(b) - 4]]`, `i` is `len(b) - 3`.**
