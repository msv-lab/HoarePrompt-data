The code appends the value of `r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1]` to the list `R`. Let's break down the changes:

- `R[-1]` is the last element of the list `R`, which is `p2 - r[len(r) - 2]`.
- `i` is `len(r) - 2`.
- `r[i]` is `r[len(r) - 2]`.
- `r[i - 1]` is `r[len(r) - 3]`.

Therefore, the value being appended to `R` is:
\[ r[\text{len}(r) - 2] - r[\text{len}(r) - 3] + (p2 - r[\text{len}(r) - 2]) \]

Simplifying this expression:
\[ r[\text{len}(r) - 2] - r[\text{len}(r) - 3] + p2 - r[\text{len}(r) - 2] = p2 - r[\text{len}(r) - 3] \]

So, the new element appended to `R` is `p2 - r[len(r) - 3]`.

The output state is:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is now `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2], p2 - r[len(r) - 3]]`.
- `i` is `len(r) - 2`.
