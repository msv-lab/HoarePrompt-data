The value of `ans2` is set to `p2 - p1`. The values of `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and the lists `r` and `b` also remain unaffected. The value of `ans1` remains 2 * (p2 - p1). Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R', `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.**
