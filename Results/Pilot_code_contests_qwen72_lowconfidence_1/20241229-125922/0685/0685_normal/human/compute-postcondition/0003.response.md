To ensure the loop executes correctly based on the provided state, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Iteration Variable (`i`)**: The loop variable `i` should start from the beginning of the range defined by `a1`. Since `a1` is the number of cities, `i` should start from 0 (assuming Python-like zero-based indexing).

2. **Range of Loop (`a1`)**: The value of `a1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, this condition is already satisfied.

3. **Initial State of Lists (`r` and `b`)**: The lists `r` and `b` are initially empty. They do not affect the loop's ability to start, but they should remain as they are since they will be populated within the loop.

4. **Initial State of `ans1`**: `ans1` is 0. This does not affect the loop's execution but is part of the initial state.

5. **City Coordinates and Types (`p1` and `p2`)**: These are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities. The cities are given in increasing order of their coordinates, and all `x_i` are distinct. This is part of the initial state and does not need adjustment for the loop to start.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
