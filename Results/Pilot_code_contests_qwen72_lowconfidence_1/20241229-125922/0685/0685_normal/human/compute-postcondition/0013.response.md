The provided code snippet attempts to append the first element of the tuple at index `i` (which is 1) to the list `b`. However, the code `b.append(i[0])` is incorrect because `i` is an integer and cannot be indexed. Assuming there was an intention to use the index `i` to access elements in `p1` or `p2`, the correct approach would be to use `p1[i]` or `p2[i]` depending on the context.

Given the initial state and assuming the correct code should be `b.append(p1[i][0])` or `b.append(p2[i][0])` (depending on which list is intended), let's proceed with the assumption that `p1` is the intended list:

Initial State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- All `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9.
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is 0.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B', otherwise `b` remains an empty list.
- `i` is 1.

Code:
```python
b.append(p1[i][0])
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `p1[i]` refers to the tuple at index 1 of `p1`.
3. `p1[i][0]` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`.
4. `b.append(p1[i][0])` appends this first element to the list `b`.

Output State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- All `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9.
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is 0.
- `r` is an empty list.
- `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B', and now also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B', and now also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`, `i` is 1.**
