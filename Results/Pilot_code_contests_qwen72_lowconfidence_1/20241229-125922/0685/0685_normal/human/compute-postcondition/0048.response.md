Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\), `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2], p2 - r[len(r) - 3], ..., p2 - r[0]]`, `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.**
