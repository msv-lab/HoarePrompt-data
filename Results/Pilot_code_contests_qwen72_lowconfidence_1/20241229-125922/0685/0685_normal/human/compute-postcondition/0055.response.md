The code snippet `L.append(b[i] - b[i - 1] + L[-1])` updates the list `L` by appending a new value to it. This new value is calculated as the difference between the current element `b[i]` and the previous element `b[i - 1]` plus the last element in the list `L`.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 1.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.
- `i` is 1.

Step-by-step impact of the code:
1. `L` initially contains one element: `b[0] - p1`.
2. The new element to be appended to `L` is calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1] + L[-1]`.
3. Substituting `i = 1`, the new element is `b[1] - b[0] + L[-1]`.
4. Since `L[-1]` is `b[0] - p1`, the new element becomes `b[1] - b[0] + (b[0] - p1)`.
5. Simplifying, the new element is `b[1] - p1`.

After the code execution, the updated state is:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 1.
- `L` is now `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 1, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`, `i` is 1.**
