The code snippet `L.append(r[i] - r[i - 1] + L[-1])` modifies the list `L` by appending a new element. This new element is calculated as the difference between the current city coordinate `r[i]` and the previous city coordinate `r[i - 1]`, plus the last element in the list `L`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `L` is initially `[r[0] - p1]`.
- `i` is 1.

Let's break down the calculation:
1. `r[i] - r[i - 1]` calculates the distance between the second city of type 'R' and the first city of type 'R'.
2. `L[-1]` refers to the last element in `L`, which is `r[0] - p1`.
3. The new element to be appended to `L` is `r[1] - r[0] + (r[0] - p1)`.

Simplifying the expression:
\[ r[1] - r[0] + (r[0] - p1) = r[1] - p1 \]

Therefore, the new element being appended to `L` is `r[1] - p1`.

The updated list `L` will be:
\[ L = [r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1] \]

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is 1**.
