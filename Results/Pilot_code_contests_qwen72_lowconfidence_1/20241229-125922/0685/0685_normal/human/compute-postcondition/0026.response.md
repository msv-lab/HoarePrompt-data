The code snippet `R = [p2 - r[-1]]` modifies the list `R`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R'.
2. `r[-1]` accesses the last element in the list `r`, which is the coordinate of the rightmost city of type 'R'.
3. `p2 - r[-1]` calculates the difference between the coordinate `p2` and the coordinate of the rightmost city of type 'R'.
4. This difference is then stored as the only element in a new list `R`.

The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `b`, and `L`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R', `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'. The length of the list `r` is greater than 0. `L` is `[r[0] - p1]`. `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.**
