Postcondition: ***`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all `x_i` are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2` if the type of the city at index 1 is 'B'. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'B', `b` also contains the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p1`. If the type of the city at index 1 of `p1` is 'R', an error occurs due to attempting to index an integer. `i` is 1.***
