To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `R` is initialized with a single element: `p2 - b[-1]`.
- `L` is initialized with a single element: `b[0] - p1`.
- The loop statement is:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, len(b)):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(b))` will execute if the range from 1 to `len(b)` (exclusive) contains at least one element. This means `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - The length of `b` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` should be 1 at the start of the first iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 1.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.
- `i` is 1.

### Final State:
State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\). If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\). The length of `b` is greater than 1. `L` is `[b[0] - p1]`. `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`. `i` is 1.**
