To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the code and the changes it makes during each iteration. We'll start by understanding the loop's behavior and then derive the final state.

### Initial State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(r) - 1, 0, -1):
    R.append(r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition**: The loop starts at `i = len(r) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches 1.
2. **Loop Body**: In each iteration, the loop appends a new value to the list `R`. This value is calculated as `r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1]`.

### Iteration Breakdown:
- **First Iteration**:
  - `i = len(r) - 1`
  - `R.append(r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2] + R[-1])`
  - `R` becomes `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2])]`
- **Second Iteration**:
  - `i = len(r) - 2`
  - `R.append(r[len(r) - 2] - r[len(r) - 3] + R[-1])`
  - `R` becomes `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2]), p2 - r[len(r) - 3] + (r[len(r) - 2] - r[len(r) - 3] + (p2 - r[len(r) - 2] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2])))`
- **General Pattern**:
  - After `k` iterations, `R` will have `k + 1` elements.
  - The last element of `R` after `k` iterations will be `p2 - r[len(r) - (k + 1)] + (r[len(r) - k] - r[len(r) - (k + 1)] + ... + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2]))`.

### Final State:
- The loop will execute `len(r) - 1` times.
- After the loop completes, `R` will have `len(r)` elements.
- The last element of `R` will be `p2 - r[0] + (r[1] - r[0] + r[2] - r[1] + ... + r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2])`, which simplifies to `p2 - r[0] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[0]) = p2 - r[0] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[0]) = p2 - r[0] + (r[len(r) - 1] - r[0]) = p2 - r[0]`.

### Final Output State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2], p2 - r[len(r) - 3], ..., p2 - r[0]]`.
