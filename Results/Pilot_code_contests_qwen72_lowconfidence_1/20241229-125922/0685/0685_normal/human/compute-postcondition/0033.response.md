To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes it makes to the variables. Let's break down the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is initialized as `[r[0] - p1]`.
- `R` is initialized as `[p2 - r[-1]]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, len(r)):
    L.append(r[i] - r[i - 1] + L[-1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(r) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, `L` is updated by appending the value `r[i] - r[i - 1] + L[-1]`.

2. **Effect on `L`**:
   - Initially, `L` is `[r[0] - p1]`.
   - After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `L` becomes `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1]`.
   - After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `L` becomes `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`.
   - This pattern continues until the loop finishes.

3. **Final State of `L`**:
   - After all iterations, `L` will contain the cumulative distances from `p1` to each city in `r`.
   - Specifically, `L` will be `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.

4. **Final State of Other Variables**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `b`, and `R` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Output State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\).
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
- `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.
