Postcondition: ***`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\). If `b` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + 2 \times \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - b[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(b) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(b) - 2`. Additionally, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]` and `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`. If `b` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).***
