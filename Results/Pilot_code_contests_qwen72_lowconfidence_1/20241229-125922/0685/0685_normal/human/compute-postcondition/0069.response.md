To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(b) - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `len(b) - 2` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `len(b) - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 0.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.
- `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1` and `p2 - b[0]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this condition:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 1, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`, `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1` and `p2 - b[0]`, `i` is 0**.
