To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(r) - 1` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i < len(r)`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
   - `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
   - The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
   - `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1).
   - `ans2` is p2 - p1.
   - `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B'.
   - `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`.
   - `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - The loop condition `i < len(r)` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `r` has at least 3 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must have at least 4 elements.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - Increment `i` from 2 to 3.
   - Ensure that `r` has at least 4 elements.

Given these adjustments, the new state is:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is 3**
