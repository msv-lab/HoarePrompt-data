To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State:
- `p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities.
- `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- All \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\).
- The cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 0.
- `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(len(b) - 1, 0, -1):
    R.append(b[i] - b[i - 1] + R[-1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `R`:**
   - Initially, `R` contains one element: `p2 - b[-1]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = len(b) - 1` down to `i = 1`.
   - For each iteration, a new element is appended to `R` calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1] + R[-1]`.

3. **Effect of Each Iteration:**
   - The new element added to `R` is the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `b` starting from the end of the list and adding the initial value of `R[-1]`.

4. **Final State of `R`:**
   - After the loop finishes, `R` will contain `len(b)` elements.
   - The elements of `R` will be:
     - `R[0] = p2 - b[-1]`
     - `R[1] = (b[-1] - b[-2]) + R[0]`
     - `R[2] = (b[-2] - b[-3]) + R[1]`
     - ...
     - `R[len(b) - 1] = (b[1] - b[0]) + R[len(b) - 2]`

5. **Simplified Final State of `R`:**
   - `R[0] = p2 - b[-1]`
   - `R[1] = p2 - b[-2]`
   - `R[2] = p2 - b[-3]`
   - ...
   - `R[len(b) - 1] = p2 - b[0]`

### Output State:
After the loop executes, the final state of the variables will be:
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.
- `a1` remains unchanged.
- All \(x_i\) remain unchanged.
- The cities are still given in the increasing order of their coordinates.
- `ans1` remains \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\).
- If `r` is not empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`.
- If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\).
- The length of `b` is greater than 0.
- `L` remains `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`.
- `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), if `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`, if `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\), the length of `b` is greater than 0, `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.**
