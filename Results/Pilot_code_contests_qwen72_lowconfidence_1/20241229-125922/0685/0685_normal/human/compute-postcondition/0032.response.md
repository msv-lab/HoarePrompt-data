The code snippet `L.append(r[i] - r[i - 1] + L[-1])` modifies the list `L` by appending a new value calculated as the difference between the `i`-th element and the `(i-1)`-th element of the list `r`, added to the last element of `L`.

Given:
- `i` is 3
- `L` is initially `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1]`

The new value appended to `L` is:
- `r[3] - r[2] + L[-1]`
- `L[-1]` is `r[2] - p1`

Thus, the new value is:
- `r[3] - r[2] + (r[2] - p1) = r[3] - p1`

Therefore, the updated `L` becomes:
- `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, r[3] - p1]`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 2 * (p2 - p1), `ans2` is p2 - p1, `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, r[3] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1]]`, `i` is 3**
