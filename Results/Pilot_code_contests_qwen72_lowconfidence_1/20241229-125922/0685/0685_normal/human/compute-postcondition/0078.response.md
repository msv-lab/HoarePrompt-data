Output State: **The program returns the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), and `ans2` is calculated as \(p2 - p1 + 2 \times \text{min1}\) if `b` is not empty. If `b` is empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\). Here, `min1` is the minimum of `b[len(b) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - b[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(b) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(b) - 2`. `L` is `[b[0] - p1, b[1] - p1, ..., b[len(b) - 1] - p1]` and `R` is `[p2 - b[-1], p2 - b[-2], p2 - b[-3], ..., p2 - b[0]]`.**
