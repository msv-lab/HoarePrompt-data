The code snippet `b.append(i[0])` appends the first element of the tuple at index `i` of `p1` or `p2` (assuming `i` refers to one of these lists) to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 0 and the type of the city at index `i` is 'B', the first element of the tuple at index `i` (which represents the coordinate of the city) is appended to `b`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that 2 ≤ a1 ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, all x_i are distinct integers within the range -10^9 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is 0, `r` is an empty list, `b` is a list containing the first element of the tuple at index 0 of `p1` or `p2`, `i` is 0, the type of the city at index `i` is not 'R', and the type of the city at index `i` is 'B'.**
