The code snippet `R = [p2 - b[-1]]` initializes the list `R` with a single element which is the difference between the tuple `p2` and the last element of the list `b`.

- `R` is now initialized with a single element: `p2 - b[-1]`.
- All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `r`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
- `L` is already initialized with a single element: `b[0] - p1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\). If `r` is not empty, `ans2` is \(p2 - p1 + \text{min1}\), where `min1` is the minimum of `r[len(r) - 1] - p1`, `p2 - r[0]`, and the sums `L[i] + R[len(r) - i - 2]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `len(r) - 2`. If `r` is empty, `ans2` remains \(p2 - p1\). The length of `b` is greater than 0. `L` is `[b[0] - p1]`. `R` is `[p2 - b[-1]]`.**
