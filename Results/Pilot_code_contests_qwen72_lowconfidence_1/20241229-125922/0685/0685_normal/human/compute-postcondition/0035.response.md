The code appends a new element to the list `R`. This new element is calculated as the difference between the last and second last elements of the `r` list, plus the last element of the `R` list.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements.
- `R` is initially `[p2 - r[-1]]`.
- `i` is `len(r) - 1`.

The new element added to `R` is `r[i] - r[i - 1] + R[-1]`, which translates to `r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2] + (p2 - r[-1])`.

Since `r[-1]` is the same as `r[len(r) - 1]`, the expression simplifies to:
- `r[len(r) - 1] - r[len(r) - 2] + (p2 - r[len(r) - 1])`
- This further simplifies to `p2 - r[len(r) - 2]`.

Thus, the new element appended to `R` is `p2 - r[len(r) - 2]`.

Therefore, the updated `R` list is `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2]]`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are tuples representing the coordinates and types of the cities, `a1` is an integer such that \(2 \leq a1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), all \(x_i\) are distinct integers within the range \(-10^9 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates, `ans1` is \(2 \times (p2 - p1)\), `ans2` is \(p2 - p1\), `r` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'R' and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing the coordinates of all cities of type 'B', `L` is `[r[0] - p1, r[1] - p1, r[2] - p1, ..., r[len(r) - 1] - p1]`, `R` is `[p2 - r[-1], p2 - r[len(r) - 2]]`, `i` is `len(r) - 1`**
