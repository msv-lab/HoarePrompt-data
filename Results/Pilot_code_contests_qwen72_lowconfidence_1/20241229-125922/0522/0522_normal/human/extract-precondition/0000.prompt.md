You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given an integer n (n ≥ 0) represented with k digits in base (radix) b. So,

$$$n = a_1 ⋅ b^{k-1} + a_2 ⋅ b^{k-2} + … a_{k-1} ⋅ b + a_k.$$$

For example, if b=17, k=3 and a=[11, 15, 7] then n=11⋅17^2+15⋅17+7=3179+255+7=3441.

Determine whether n is even or odd.

Input

The first line contains two integers b and k (2≤ b≤ 100, 1≤ k≤ 10^5) — the base of the number and the number of digits.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k (0≤ a_i < b) — the digits of n.

The representation of n contains no unnecessary leading zero. That is, a_1 can be equal to 0 only if k = 1.

Output

Print "even" if n is even, otherwise print "odd".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

13 3
3 2 7


Output

even


Input

10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


Output

odd


Input

99 5
32 92 85 74 4


Output

odd


Input

2 2
1 0


Output

even

Note

In the first example, n = 3 ⋅ 13^2 + 2 ⋅ 13 + 7 = 540, which is even.

In the second example, n = 123456789 is odd.

In the third example, n = 32 ⋅ 99^4 + 92 ⋅ 99^3 + 85 ⋅ 99^2 + 74 ⋅ 99 + 4 = 3164015155 is odd.

In the fourth example n = 2.
Function definition:
```
def func_1():
```
