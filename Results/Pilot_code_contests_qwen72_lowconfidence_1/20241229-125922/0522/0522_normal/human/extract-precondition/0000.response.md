It seems there was an error in the function definition provided. Based on the problem description, the function should take parameters for the base `b`, the number of digits `k`, and the list of digits `a`. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(b, k, a):
```

Precondition: **b is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of k integers where 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i. The list a does not contain leading zeros unless k = 1.**
