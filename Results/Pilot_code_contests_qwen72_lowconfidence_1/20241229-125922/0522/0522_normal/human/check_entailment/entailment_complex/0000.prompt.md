You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an integer n (n ≥ 0) represented with k digits in base (radix) b. So,

$$$n = a_1 ⋅ b^{k-1} + a_2 ⋅ b^{k-2} + … a_{k-1} ⋅ b + a_k.$$$

For example, if b=17, k=3 and a=[11, 15, 7] then n=11⋅17^2+15⋅17+7=3179+255+7=3441.

Determine whether n is even or odd.

Input

The first line contains two integers b and k (2≤ b≤ 100, 1≤ k≤ 10^5) — the base of the number and the number of digits.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k (0≤ a_i < b) — the digits of n.

The representation of n contains no unnecessary leading zero. That is, a_1 can be equal to 0 only if k = 1.

Output

Print "even" if n is even, otherwise print "odd".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

13 3
3 2 7


Output

even


Input

10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


Output

odd


Input

99 5
32 92 85 74 4


Output

odd


Input

2 2
1 0


Output

even

Note

In the first example, n = 3 ⋅ 13^2 + 2 ⋅ 13 + 7 = 540, which is even.

In the second example, n = 123456789 is odd.

In the third example, n = 32 ⋅ 99^4 + 92 ⋅ 99^3 + 85 ⋅ 99^2 + 74 ⋅ 99 + 4 = 3164015155 is odd.

In the fourth example n = 2.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of k integers where 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i. The list a does not contain leading zeros unless k = 1.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is `k % 2`, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. If `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is even, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. Otherwise, if `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is odd, `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`.
    print('odd' if m else 'even')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `b` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `k` integers `a`. It then determines whether the sum of the elements in `a` is odd or even. Specifically, it checks the parity of the last element `a[-1]` and toggles this parity based on the number of odd elements in the rest of the list `a[:-1]` if `k` is odd. Finally, it prints 'odd' if the resulting parity is odd, and 'even' otherwise. The function does not return any value. Note that the function assumes the input constraints: 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i, with no leading zeros unless k = 1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
