You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an integer n (n ≥ 0) represented with k digits in base (radix) b. So,

$$$n = a_1 ⋅ b^{k-1} + a_2 ⋅ b^{k-2} + … a_{k-1} ⋅ b + a_k.$$$

For example, if b=17, k=3 and a=[11, 15, 7] then n=11⋅17^2+15⋅17+7=3179+255+7=3441.

Determine whether n is even or odd.

Input

The first line contains two integers b and k (2≤ b≤ 100, 1≤ k≤ 10^5) — the base of the number and the number of digits.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k (0≤ a_i < b) — the digits of n.

The representation of n contains no unnecessary leading zero. That is, a_1 can be equal to 0 only if k = 1.

Output

Print "even" if n is even, otherwise print "odd".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

13 3
3 2 7


Output

even


Input

10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


Output

odd


Input

99 5
32 92 85 74 4


Output

odd


Input

2 2
1 0


Output

even

Note

In the first example, n = 3 ⋅ 13^2 + 2 ⋅ 13 + 7 = 540, which is even.

In the second example, n = 123456789 is odd.

In the third example, n = 32 ⋅ 99^4 + 92 ⋅ 99^3 + 85 ⋅ 99^2 + 74 ⋅ 99 + 4 = 3164015155 is odd.

In the fourth example n = 2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it determines whether the number `n` is even or odd. Specifically, the variable `n` is incorrectly used to store the result of `k % 2`, which is not related to the parity of the number `n`. Instead, the parity of `n` should be determined by the sum of the products of the digits and their respective powers of the base `b`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the parity of the sum of the products of the digits and their respective powers of the base `b`. However, a simpler and more efficient approach is to realize that the parity of `n` is determined solely by the parity of the last digit `a_k` in the base `b` representation, because all other terms in the sum are multiples of `b` and thus do not affect the parity if `b` is even. If `b` is odd, the parity of `n` is determined by the sum of the parities of all the digits.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (b, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Determine the parity of n
    if b % 2 == 0:
        # If the base is even, the parity of n is determined by the last digit
        m = a[-1] % 2
    else:
        # If the base is odd, the parity of n is determined by the sum of the parities of all digits
        m = sum(digit % 2 for digit in a) % 2
    
    print('odd' if m else 'even')
```

The original program fails to handle cases where the base `b` is odd and the sum of the parities of the digits affects the final parity of `n`. For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
1 1 1
```

The correct output should be `odd` because \( n = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 \), which is odd. However, the original program would incorrectly output `even` because it does not correctly handle the sum of the parities of the digits when the base is odd.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is `k % 2`, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. If `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is even, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. Otherwise, if `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is odd, `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`.
    print('odd' if m else 'even')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `b` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `k` integers `a`. It then determines whether the sum of the elements in `a` is odd or even. Specifically, it checks the parity of the last element `a[-1]` and toggles this parity based on the number of odd elements in the rest of the list `a[:-1]` if `k` is odd. Finally, it prints 'odd' if the resulting parity is odd, and 'even' otherwise. The function does not return any value. Note that the function assumes the input constraints: 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i, with no leading zeros unless k = 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
