You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an integer n (n ≥ 0) represented with k digits in base (radix) b. So,

$$$n = a_1 ⋅ b^{k-1} + a_2 ⋅ b^{k-2} + … a_{k-1} ⋅ b + a_k.$$$

For example, if b=17, k=3 and a=[11, 15, 7] then n=11⋅17^2+15⋅17+7=3179+255+7=3441.

Determine whether n is even or odd.

Input

The first line contains two integers b and k (2≤ b≤ 100, 1≤ k≤ 10^5) — the base of the number and the number of digits.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, …, a_k (0≤ a_i < b) — the digits of n.

The representation of n contains no unnecessary leading zero. That is, a_1 can be equal to 0 only if k = 1.

Output

Print "even" if n is even, otherwise print "odd".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Examples

Input

13 3
3 2 7


Output

even


Input

10 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


Output

odd


Input

99 5
32 92 85 74 4


Output

odd


Input

2 2
1 0


Output

even

Note

In the first example, n = 3 ⋅ 13^2 + 2 ⋅ 13 + 7 = 540, which is even.

In the second example, n = 123456789 is odd.

In the third example, n = 32 ⋅ 99^4 + 92 ⋅ 99^3 + 85 ⋅ 99^2 + 74 ⋅ 99 + 4 = 3164015155 is odd.

In the fourth example n = 2.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly determine whether the number `n` is even or odd based on the given problem description. It uses the properties of parity (evenness or oddness) in modular arithmetic to avoid computing the potentially large value of `n`. Specifically, it checks the parity of the last digit and adjusts this based on the parity of the base and the length of the number. This approach works because the parity of a sum is determined by the parity of its individual terms, and the parity of a product depends only on the parity of its factors. Since the program correctly implements these principles and handles all specified edge cases, it is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` reads two integers `b` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `k` integers `a`. It then determines whether the sum of the elements in `a` is odd or even. Specifically, it checks the parity of the last element `a[-1]` and toggles this parity based on the number of odd elements in the rest of the list `a[:-1]` if `k` is odd. Finally, it prints 'odd' if the resulting parity is odd, and 'even' otherwise. The function does not return any value. Note that the function assumes the input constraints: 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i, with no leading zeros unless k = 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
