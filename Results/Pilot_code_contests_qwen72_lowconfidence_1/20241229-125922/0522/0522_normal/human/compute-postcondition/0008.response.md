Postcondition: ***`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`, `i` is the first element of `a[:-1]`. If `i % 2 == 1`, then `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`.***
