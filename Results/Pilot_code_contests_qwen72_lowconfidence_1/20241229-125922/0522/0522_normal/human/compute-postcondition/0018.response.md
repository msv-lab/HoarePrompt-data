The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 100.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `k` integers where 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i. The list `a` does not contain leading zeros unless k = 1.

The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to know what the function is supposed to return. However, based on the given parameters, we can describe the function's input and the general structure of its expected output.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `b`, `k`, and `a`. `b` is an integer such that 2 ≤ b ≤ 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `k` integers where 0 ≤ a[i] < b for all i, and the list `a` does not contain leading zeros unless k = 1.
