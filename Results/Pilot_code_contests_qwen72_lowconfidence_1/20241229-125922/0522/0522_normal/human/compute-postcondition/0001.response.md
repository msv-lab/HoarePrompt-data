The value of `a` is updated to a list of integers read from input using `input().split()`. Each element in the list is converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The length of the list `a` is now determined by the number of integers provided in the input, and each element of `a` is an integer. The values of `b` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, and `a` does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1.**
