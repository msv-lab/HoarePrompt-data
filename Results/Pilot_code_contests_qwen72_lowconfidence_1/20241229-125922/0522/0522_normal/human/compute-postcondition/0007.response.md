The value of `m` is toggled from its current boolean state. Since `m` was initially `a[-1] % 2`, which results in a boolean value (0 or 1 interpreted as False or True), the new value of `m` is the negation of this initial value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is 1, `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`, `i` is the first element of `a[:-1]`, and the current value of `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 == 1`)**
