The code `m = not m` changes the value of `m` to its logical negation. Based on the initial state:

- `i` is the third element of `a[:-1]`.
- `m` is re-evaluated based on the new value of `i`. If `i % 2 == 1`, then `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`. Otherwise, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`.

After the code `m = not m` is executed, the value of `m` is inverted. The other variables (`b`, `k`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`b` and `k` remain the same, `a` remains the same, `n` remains 1, `i` is the third element of `a[:-1]`, `m` is the logical negation of its previous value.**
