Postcondition: ***`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input that does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is `k % 2`, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. If `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is even, `m` is `a[-1] % 2`. Otherwise, if `n` == 1 and the number of odd numbers in `a[:-1]` is odd, `m` is `not (a[-1] % 2)`.***
