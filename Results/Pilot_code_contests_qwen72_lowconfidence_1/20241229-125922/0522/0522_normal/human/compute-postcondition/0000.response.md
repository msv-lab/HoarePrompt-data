The values of `b` and `k` are updated based on the input provided. The new values of `b` and `k` are taken from the input, which is split and converted to integers. The list `a` remains unchanged, and its properties (that it contains `k` integers, each less than `b`, and does not contain leading zeros unless `k = 1`) still hold true.

Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of `k` integers where 0 â‰¤ `a[i]` < `b` for all `i`, and `a` does not contain leading zeros unless `k` = 1.**
