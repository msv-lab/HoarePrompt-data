The value of `n` is assigned the result of `k % 2`. This operation computes the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. The possible values for `n` are 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is even or odd, respectively. The other variables (`b`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, and `a` does not contain leading zeros unless the length of `a` is 1, `n` is `k % 2`**
