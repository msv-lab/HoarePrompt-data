The code attempts to print a formatted string that includes the values of `x` and `z`. However, since `x` is undefined, this will raise a `NameError`. The other variables (`f`, `i`, and `z`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, an error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`, and `z` is less than 400**
