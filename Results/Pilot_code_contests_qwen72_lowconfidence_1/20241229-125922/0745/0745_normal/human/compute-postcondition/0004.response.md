The code snippet `f.append(int(raw_input()))` appends an integer input by the user to the list `f`. The variable `i` remains unchanged.

- `f` was initially a list containing one integer value. After executing the code, `f` now contains this original integer value plus the new integer input by the user.
- `i` is still 1 and is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`f` is a list containing two integer values, `i` is 1**.
