The `reverse()` method reverses the elements of the list `f` in place. This means the order of the elements in `f` is reversed, but the list itself remains the same object.

Initial State: `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 10.

After executing `f.reverse()`, the list `f` is reversed, but the variable `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10**
