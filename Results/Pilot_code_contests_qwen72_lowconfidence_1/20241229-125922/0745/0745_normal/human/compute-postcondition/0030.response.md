The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads integers from standard input, where each integer is expected to be between -50 and 50, inclusive. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the input values. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, the general functionality is to read integers within the specified range from standard input and process them.
