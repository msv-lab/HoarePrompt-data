`y` is assigned the absolute value of `x`. Since `x` is the 11th element in the list `f`, and `f` contains integers between -50 and 50, `y` will be the absolute value of the 11th element in `f`. The values of `f`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is the 11th element in the list `f`, `y` is the absolute value of the 11th element in the list `f`**
