To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as `for i in range(11):`, which means the loop will iterate 11 times, with `i` starting from 0 and going up to 10.

Given the initial state:
- The function reads from standard input, where each line contains an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive.
- `f` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute:
- The range `11` is a constant, so no adjustment is needed for the loop to start.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop itself.
- The state of `f` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it is part of the initial state.

Therefore, the only necessary condition for the loop to execute is that the loop variable `i` should start at 0, and the range `11` ensures that the loop will run 11 times.

State: **`f` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
