Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is `f[10]`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]`. If `z` < 400, the values of `x` and `z` are printed in a specific format. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
