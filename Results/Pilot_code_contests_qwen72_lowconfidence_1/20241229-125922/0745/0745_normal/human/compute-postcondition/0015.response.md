The code attempts to print a formatted string using the value of `x`. However, since `x` is undefined, this will raise a `NameError`. The values of the other variables (`f`, `i`, `z`) remain unchanged. The error condition due to undefined variables `x` and `y` persists.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, an error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`, and `z` is greater than or equal to 400**
