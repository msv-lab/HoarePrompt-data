The provided code snippet prints a formatted string using the values of `x` and `z`. Let's break down the impact:

- `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` is 10.
- `x` is `f[10]`, which means `x` is the last element in the list `f`.
- `y` is `abs(f[10])`, which is the absolute value of `x`.
- `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]`, which simplifies to `sqrt(y) + x`.

The print statement will output the value of `x` and `z` in a specific format. However, this does not change the state of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is `f[10]`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]`**.
