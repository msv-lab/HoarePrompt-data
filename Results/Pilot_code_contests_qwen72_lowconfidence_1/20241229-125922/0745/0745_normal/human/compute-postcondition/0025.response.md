To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

- `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` is 10.
- `x` is the 11th element in the list `f`.
- `y` is the absolute value of the 11th element in the list `f`.

Given the code snippet:
```
z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5
```

1. **Determine the value of `x`:**
   - Since `x` is the 11th element in the list `f`, and `f` is in reverse order, `x` is the first element of the original list before reversing.

2. **Determine the value of `y`:**
   - `y` is the absolute value of `x`. If `x` is a negative integer, `y` will be its positive counterpart.

3. **Calculate the value of `z`:**
   - `sqrt(y)` computes the square root of `y`.
   - `x ** 3` computes the cube of `x`.
   - `x ** 3 * 5` multiplies the cube of `x` by 5.
   - `z` is the sum of `sqrt(y)` and `x ** 3 * 5`.

Let's denote the 11th element (first element before reversing) of the list `f` as `f[10]` (since indexing starts from 0).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Value of `x`:**
   - `x = f[10]`

2. **Value of `y`:**
   - `y = abs(f[10])`

3. **Value of `z`:**
   - `z = sqrt(abs(f[10])) + (f[10] ** 3) * 5`

### Final Output State:

- `f` remains a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` remains 10.
- `x` remains the 11th element in the list `f`.
- `y` remains the absolute value of the 11th element in the list `f`.
- `z` is calculated as `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + (f[10] ** 3) * 5`.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is `f[10]`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + (f[10] ** 3) * 5`**.
