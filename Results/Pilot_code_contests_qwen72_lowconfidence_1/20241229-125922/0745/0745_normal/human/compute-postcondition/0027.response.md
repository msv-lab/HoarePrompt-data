The code snippet `print('f(%d) = MAGNA NIMIS!' % x)` prints a formatted string where `%d` is replaced by the value of `x`. This does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` is 10.
- `x` is `f[10]`.
- `y` is `abs(f[10])`.
- `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]`.

After executing the code, the output state remains the same because no variables are modified by the `print` statement.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is `f[10]`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]`.**
