The provided code attempts to compute `z` using the formula `sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5`. However, since `x` and `y` are both undefined, this operation will result in an error. Given the initial state, the program will remain in the same state because an error occurred due to undefined variables.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state:

- `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` is 10.
- `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined.
- An error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`.
- If `z` is less than 400, the program remains in the same state as the precondition.
- If `z` is greater than or equal to 400, the program also remains in the same state as the precondition.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, an error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`. If `z` is less than 400, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. If `z` is greater than or equal to 400, the program also remains in the same state as the precondition.**
