To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables involved. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State
- `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
- `i` is 10.

### Loop Code
```python
for x in f:
    y = abs(x)
    z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5
    if z < 400:
        print('f(%d) = %.2f' % (x, z))
    else:
        print('f(%d) = MAGNA NIMIS!' % x)
```

### Analysis
1. **Iteration Process**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `f`.
   - For each element `x` in `f`, the following steps are performed:
     - `y` is set to the absolute value of `x`.
     - `z` is calculated as `sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5`.
     - If `z` is less than 400, the program prints `f(x) = z` in a specific format.
     - If `z` is 400 or greater, the program prints `f(x) = MAGNA NIMIS!`.

2. **Variable States**:
   - `f` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `i` is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` takes on each value in `f` sequentially.
   - `y` is calculated as the absolute value of `x` for each iteration.
   - `z` is calculated based on the current value of `x` and `y`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `f` will still be a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order.
   - `i` will still be 10.
   - `x` will be the last element of `f` (since the loop iterates over all elements).
   - `y` will be the absolute value of the last element of `f`.
   - `z` will be the result of the calculation `sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5` for the last element of `f`.

### Output State
Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is the last element of `f`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10] ** 3 * 5`.**
