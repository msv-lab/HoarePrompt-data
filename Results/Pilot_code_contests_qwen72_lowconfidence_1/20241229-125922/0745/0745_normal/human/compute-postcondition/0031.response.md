Functionality: ** The function `func` reads 11 integers from standard input, where each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive. It stores these integers in a list `f`. The list is then reversed. For each integer `x` in the reversed list, it calculates `y` as the absolute value of `x`, and `z` as the square root of `y` plus five times the cube of `x`. If `z` is less than 400, it prints `f(x) = z` formatted to two decimal places. Otherwise, it prints `f(x) = MAGNA NIMIS!`. After the function completes, the list `f` contains 11 integers in reverse order, and the program has printed the results for each integer in `f`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling negative numbers and the boundary condition where `z` is exactly 400, which would still trigger the "MAGNA NIMIS!" message. **
