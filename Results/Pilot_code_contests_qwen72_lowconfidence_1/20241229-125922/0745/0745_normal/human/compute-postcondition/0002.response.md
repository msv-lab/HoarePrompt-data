The code snippet `f.append(int(raw_input()))` appends an integer value, obtained from user input, to the list `f`. The initial state indicates that `f` is an empty list and `i` is 0. After executing the code, the list `f` will contain one element, which is the integer value provided by the user. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing one integer value, `i` is 0**
