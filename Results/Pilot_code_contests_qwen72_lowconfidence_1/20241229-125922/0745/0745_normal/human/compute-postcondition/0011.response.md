The given code snippet is `z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5`. However, both `y` and `x` are undefined in the initial state. This means that attempting to execute this line of code will result in a runtime error because Python will not be able to resolve the values of `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, except for noting that an error occurred due to the undefined variables.

Output State: **`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, an error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`**
