Postcondition: ***`f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `y` is undefined due to `x` being undefined, and an error occurred due to undefined variables `x` and `y`. Regardless of whether `z` is less than 400 or greater than or equal to 400, the program remains in the same state as the precondition.***
