You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.

Input

The input consists of several integers, one per line. Each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive.

Output

As described in the problem statement.

Example

Input


0
1
-2
-3
-4
-5
-6
-7
-8
-9
10


Output


f(10) = MAGNA NIMIS!
f(-9) = -3642.00
f(-8) = -2557.17
f(-7) = -1712.35
f(-6) = -1077.55
f(-5) = -622.76
f(-4) = -318.00
f(-3) = -133.27
f(-2) = -38.59
f(1) = 6.00
f(0) = 0.00
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from math import *

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function reads from standard input, where each line contains an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive.
def func():
    f = []
    for i in range(11):
        f.append(int(raw_input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, `i` is 10
    f.reverse()
    for x in f:
        y = abs(x)
        
        z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5
        
        if z < 400:
            print('f(%d) = %.2f' % (x, z))
        else:
            print('f(%d) = MAGNA NIMIS!' % x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `f` is a list containing 11 integer values, each value being an integer between -50 and 50, inclusive, in reverse order, `i` is 10, `x` is the last element of `f`, `y` is `abs(f[10])`, `z` is `sqrt(abs(f[10])) + f[10]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads 11 integers from standard input, where each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive. It stores these integers in a list `f`. The list is then reversed. For each integer `x` in the reversed list, it calculates `y` as the absolute value of `x`, and `z` as the square root of `y` plus five times the cube of `x`. If `z` is less than 400, it prints `f(x) = z` formatted to two decimal places. Otherwise, it prints `f(x) = MAGNA NIMIS!`. After the function completes, the list `f` contains 11 integers in reverse order, and the program has printed the results for each integer in `f`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling negative numbers and the boundary condition where `z` is exactly 400, which would still trigger the "MAGNA NIMIS!" message.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
