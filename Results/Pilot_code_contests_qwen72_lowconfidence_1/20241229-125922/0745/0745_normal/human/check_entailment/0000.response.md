Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not handle the input and output exactly as specified in the problem description. Specifically:

1. The problem description mentions that the input consists of several integers, one per line, and each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive. However, the program reads exactly 11 integers and does not handle the case where fewer or more than 11 integers are provided.

2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This could cause issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

3. The problem description specifies the order of processing and printing the results, but the program reverses the list of inputs before processing, which changes the order of the output from what is expected.

4. The calculation `z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5` might not match the exact requirements of the problem description, especially if there are specific constraints or conditions not explicitly handled in the code.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and thus, it is considered incorrect.
