You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

Input

The input consists of several integers, one per line. Each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive.

Output

As described in the problem statement.

Example

Input


0
1
-2
-3
-4
-5
-6
-7
-8
-9
10


Output


f(10) = MAGNA NIMIS!
f(-9) = -3642.00
f(-8) = -2557.17
f(-7) = -1712.35
f(-6) = -1077.55
f(-5) = -622.76
f(-4) = -318.00
f(-3) = -133.27
f(-2) = -38.59
f(1) = 6.00
f(0) = 0.00
Program:
```
from math import *

def func():
    f = []
    for i in range(11):
        f.append(int(raw_input()))
    f.reverse()
    for x in f:
        y = abs(x)
        z = sqrt(y) + x ** 3 * 5
        if z < 400:
            print('f(%d) = %.2f' % (x, z))
        else:
            print('f(%d) = MAGNA NIMIS!' % x)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads 11 integers from standard input, where each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive. It stores these integers in a list `f`. The list is then reversed. For each integer `x` in the reversed list, it calculates `y` as the absolute value of `x`, and `z` as the square root of `y` plus five times the cube of `x`. If `z` is less than 400, it prints `f(x) = z` formatted to two decimal places. Otherwise, it prints `f(x) = MAGNA NIMIS!`. After the function completes, the list `f` contains 11 integers in reverse order, and the program has printed the results for each integer in `f`. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling negative numbers and the boundary condition where `z` is exactly 400, which would still trigger the "MAGNA NIMIS!" message.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
