Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not fully adhere to the problem description in the following ways:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description specifies that the input should be read and processed one by one, but the program reads all 11 inputs into a list and then processes them. This deviation from the sequential processing described in the problem can lead to issues if the input is not exactly 11 lines long.

2. **Output Order**: The problem description states that the output should be printed in the order the inputs were received, but the program reverses the list before processing, leading to the outputs being printed in reverse order. This is a significant deviation from the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**: The problem description specifies that the output should be "MAGNA NIMIS!" if the result is greater than or equal to 400, but the program only checks for greater than 400. This means that if the result is exactly 400, the program will incorrectly print the numeric value instead of "MAGNA NIMIS!".

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
