#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7.
def func_1():
    tinn = 1
    for tin in range(tinn):
        n = int(input())

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7), `tinn` is the original value of `tinn`, `tin` is `tinn - 1`, `func_2(9 * n, 8 * n)` has been called `tinn` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7`. The function then calls `func_2` with arguments `9 * n` and `8 * n`. After the function completes, the state of the program is as follows: `n` holds the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7), `tinn` remains 1, `tin` is 0, and `func_2(9 * n, 8 * n)` has been called exactly once. The function itself does not return any value. Edge cases include invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the specified range), which are not handled by the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the arguments when printed, file is a file-like object where the output will be written, and end is a string appended after the last value, flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly write the stream to underlying buffer.
def func_2():
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. The string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`. If `flush` is `True`, the internal buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It writes the string representations of the elements in `args` to a file-like object (`file`), separating them by a specified string (`sep`). After writing all elements, it appends a specified end string (`end`) to the output. If the `flush` parameter is `True`, it flushes the internal buffer of the file-like object. The function does not return any value.
