The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7`. The function then calls `func_2` with arguments `9 * n` and `8 * n`. After the function completes, the state of the program is as follows: `n` holds the last input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7), `tinn` remains 1, `tin` is 0, and `func_2(9 * n, 8 * n)` has been called exactly once. The function itself does not return any value. Edge cases include invalid input (e.g., non-integer values or values outside the specified range), which are not handled by the function.
