The value of `x`, which is the first element of `args`, is converted to a string and written to `file`. The state of `args`, `sep`, `end`, `flush`, and `at_start` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False` if it was `False` before, otherwise no additional characters are written to `file`. The string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
