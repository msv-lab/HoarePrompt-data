To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information:

- `args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type.
- `sep` is a string used to separate the arguments when printed. It is set to the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `' '`.
- `file` is a file-like object where the output will be written. It is set to the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- `end` is a string appended after the last value.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly write the stream to the underlying buffer.
- `at_start` is `True`.

The for loop iterates over `args`, so the loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element. The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, and `at_start`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop but may be used within the loop body.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`args`**: The loop will only execute if `args` is not an empty tuple. Therefore, `args` must contain at least one element.
2. **`x`**: Before the loop starts, `x` should be initialized to the first element of `args`.

### Adjusted State:
- `args` must be a non-empty tuple.
- `x` is the first element of `args`.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `True`**
