Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`. If `flush` is `True`, the internal buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
