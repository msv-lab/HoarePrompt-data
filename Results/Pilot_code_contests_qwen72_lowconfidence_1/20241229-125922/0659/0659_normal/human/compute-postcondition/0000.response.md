The code updates the values of `sep` and `file` by popping them from the `kwargs` dictionary if they exist, otherwise using default values. The default value for `sep` is a space `' '` and for `file` is `sys.stdout`.

- `sep` is set to the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `' '`.
- `file` is set to the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the arguments when printed (sep is set to the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `' '`), file is a file-like object where the output will be written (file is set to the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`), end is a string appended after the last value, flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly write the stream to the underlying buffer.**
