The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. However, since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, there is no change in its value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False`, `str(x)` has been written to `file` after `sep`.**
