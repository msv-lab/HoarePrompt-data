The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. Since `at_start` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables (`args`, `x`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` remains a non-empty tuple with at least three elements, `x` is now the third element of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` remain unchanged, `at_start` remains `False`, `str(x)` has been written to `file` after `sep` for the third element.**
