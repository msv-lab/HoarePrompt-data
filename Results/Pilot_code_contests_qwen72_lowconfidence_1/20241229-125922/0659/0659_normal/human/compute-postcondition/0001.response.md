The code snippet sets the variable `at_start` to `True`. This operation does not affect any other variables or parameters in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other conditions the same.

Output State: **args is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, sep is a string used to separate the arguments when printed (sep is set to the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `' '`), file is a file-like object where the output will be written (file is set to the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`), end is a string appended after the last value, flush is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly write the stream to the underlying buffer, `at_start` is `True`**
