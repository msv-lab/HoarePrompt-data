The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file object `file`. This operation does not change the value of `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, `args`, or `at_start`. However, it updates the state of the file by adding the separator before writing the next element.

Output State: **`args` remains a non-empty tuple with at least three elements, `x` is now the third element of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` remain unchanged, `at_start` remains `False`, `str(x)` will be written to `file` after `sep` for the third element, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
