Postcondition: ***`args` remains a non-empty tuple with at least three elements, `x` is now the third element of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` remain unchanged, `at_start` remains `False`, and `str(x)` will be written to `file` after `sep` for the third element. If `not at_start`, `sep` has also been written to `file`.***
