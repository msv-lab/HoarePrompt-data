The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file-like object `file`. The value of `sep` defaults to a single space `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`. This operation does not change the values of `args`, `x`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, or `at_start`. However, it does perform an action on the `file` object.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to `file`.**
