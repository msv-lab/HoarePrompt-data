The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`. Given the initial state, `x` is the third element of `args`, and `str(x)` will be written to `file` after `sep` because `at_start` is `False`.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions except for the action of writing to the file, which has now been performed.

Output State: **`args` remains a non-empty tuple with at least three elements, `x` is now the third element of `args`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` remain unchanged, `at_start` remains `False`, `str(x)` has been written to `file` after `sep` for the third element.**
