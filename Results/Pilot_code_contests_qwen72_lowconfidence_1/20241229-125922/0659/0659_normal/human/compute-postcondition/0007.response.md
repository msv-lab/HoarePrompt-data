The variable `at_start` is set to `False`. The other variables (`args`, `x`, `sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`) and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False`. The string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
