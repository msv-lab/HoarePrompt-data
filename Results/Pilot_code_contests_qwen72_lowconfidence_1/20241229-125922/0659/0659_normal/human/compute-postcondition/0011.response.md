The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file-like object `file`. Given the initial state:

- `args` is a non-empty tuple with at least two elements.
- `x` is the second element of `args`.
- `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`).
- `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`).
- `end` is a string.
- `flush` is a boolean.
- `at_start` is `False`.

Since `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has already been written to `file`. The current operation writes `str(x)` to `file`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `args` is a non-empty tuple with at least two elements.
- `x` is the second element of `args`.
- `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`).
- `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`).
- `end` is a string.
- `flush` is a boolean.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- `str(x)` has been written to `file` after `sep`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False`, `str(x)` has been written to `file` after `sep`.**
