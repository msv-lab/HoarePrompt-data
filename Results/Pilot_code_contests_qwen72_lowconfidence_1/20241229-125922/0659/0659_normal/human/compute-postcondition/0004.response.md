The `file.write(sep)` command writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. Since `sep` defaults to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`, and `file` defaults to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`, this command will write a single space to the specified file (or `sys.stdout` if `file` is not specified). The state of the variables does not change, only the file content is modified.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False`. A single space (or the value of `sep`) has been written to `file`.**
