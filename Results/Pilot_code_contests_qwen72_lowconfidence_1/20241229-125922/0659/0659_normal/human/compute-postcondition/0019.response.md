The code snippet `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary to the `file`. If `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `'\n'`.

- `file` receives the string from `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'` if `'end'` is not specified.
- The key `'end'` is removed from `kwargs` after its value is accessed.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`**.
