The code `file.flush()` flushes the internal buffer of the file-like object `file`. This means any buffered data is written to the file immediately. The state of the `flush` variable does not change, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple containing any number of values of any type, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is `True`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is non-empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'`. The internal buffer of `file` has been flushed.**
