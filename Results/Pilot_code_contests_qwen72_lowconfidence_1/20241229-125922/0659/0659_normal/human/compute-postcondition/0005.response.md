Postcondition: ***`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `sep` is a string (defaulting to `' '` if not specified in `kwargs`), `file` is a file-like object (defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not specified in `kwargs`), `end` is a string, `flush` is a boolean. If `at_start` is `False`, a single space (or the value of `sep`) has been written to `file`. Otherwise, no additional characters are written to `file`.***
