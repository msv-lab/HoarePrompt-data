Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly solves the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^7\).

2. **Composite Number Calculation**: The program calculates two composite numbers `a` and `b` such that \(a - b = n\). It does this by setting \(a = 9n\) and \(b = 8n\).

   - **Verification of Compositeness**:
     - \(9n\) is composite because 9 is composite and multiplying a composite number by any positive integer results in a composite number.
     - \(8n\) is composite because 8 is composite and multiplying a composite number by any positive integer results in a composite number.
   
3. **Output**: The program prints the two composite numbers `a` and `b` using the `func_2` function, which is essentially a custom print function. The output is in the form of two integers separated by a space, which matches the required output format.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Correct Calculation**: The program correctly calculates \(a = 9n\) and \(b = 8n\), ensuring that both \(a\) and \(b\) are composite numbers.
- **Range Constraints**: The values of \(a\) and \(b\) are within the allowed range \(2 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). Since \(n \leq 10^7\), \(a = 9n \leq 9 \times 10^7 = 90,000,000\) and \(b = 8n \leq 8 \times 10^7 = 80,000,000\), both of which are well within the range.
- **Output Format**: The output is formatted correctly as two integers separated by a space, as required by the problem description.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Edge Case: \(n = 1\)**:
  - For \(n = 1\), the program calculates \(a = 9 \times 1 = 9\) and \(b = 8 \times 1 = 8\). Both 9 and 8 are composite numbers, and \(9 - 8 = 1\), which satisfies the condition.
- **Edge Case: \(n = 10^7\)**:
  - For \(n = 10^7\), the program calculates \(a = 9 \times 10^7 = 90,000,000\) and \(b = 8 \times 10^7 = 80,000,000\). Both 90,000,000 and 80,000,000 are composite numbers, and \(90,000,000 - 80,000,000 = 10^7\), which satisfies the condition.

Given that the program meets all the requirements and handles edge cases correctly, it is indeed correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
