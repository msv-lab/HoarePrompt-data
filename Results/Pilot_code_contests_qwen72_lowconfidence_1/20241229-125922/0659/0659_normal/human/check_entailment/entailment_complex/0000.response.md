Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the approach taken in `func_1` to generate the composite numbers `a` and `b` as `9 * n` and `8 * n` respectively is flawed. While `9 * n` and `8 * n` are indeed composite numbers for most values of `n`, this approach fails to meet the requirement that both `a` and `b` must be within the range `[2, 10^9]`.

For example, consider the input `n = 10^7`:
- `a = 9 * 10^7 = 90000000`
- `b = 8 * 10^7 = 80000000`

Both `a` and `b` are within the allowed range `[2, 10^9]`, but for larger values of `n` (e.g., `n = 10^8`), the generated `a` and `b` would exceed the upper limit of `10^9`.

Additionally, the problem description guarantees that a solution always exists, but the current implementation does not provide a general solution that works for all valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
