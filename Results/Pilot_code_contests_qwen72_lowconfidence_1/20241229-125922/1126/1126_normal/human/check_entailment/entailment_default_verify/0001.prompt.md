You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Vasya has received a young builder’s kit. The kit consists of several wooden bars, the lengths of all of them are known. The bars can be put one on the top of the other if their lengths are the same.

Vasya wants to construct the minimal number of towers from the bars. Help Vasya to use the bars in the best way possible.

Input

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) — the number of bars at Vasya’s disposal. The second line contains N space-separated integers li — the lengths of the bars. All the lengths are natural numbers not exceeding 1000.

Output

In one line output two numbers — the height of the largest tower and their total number. Remember that Vasya should use all the bars.

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    output = sys.stdout
    "\ninput = open('input.txt','r')\noutput = open('output.txt','w')\n"
    input.readline()
    woods = map(lambda x: int(x), input.readline().strip().split(' '))
    d = {}
    for w in woods:
        d[w] = d.setdefault(w, 0) + 1
    output.write('%d %d' % (max(d.values()), len(d)))
    output.close()


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input is empty or invalid. According to the problem description, the input should contain an integer \(N\) followed by \(N\) space-separated integers representing the lengths of the bars. However, the program does not validate the input to ensure that \(N\) is within the specified range (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) or that the lengths are natural numbers not exceeding 1000. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input might be malformed, such as having fewer than \(N\) lengths provided.

For example, consider the following invalid input:
```
5
1 2 3 4
```
Here, the number of lengths provided (4) does not match the expected number (5). The program will still attempt to process this input, which could lead to incorrect results or errors.

Another issue is that the program uses `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` directly, which makes it difficult to test and verify the program's behavior with different inputs. While this is a minor issue, it can affect the robustness of the program.

To make the program correct, it should include input validation and error handling to ensure that the input adheres to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads from a file named 'input.txt' and writes to a file named 'output.txt'. It expects the first line of 'input.txt' to contain an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) indicating the number of integers in the subsequent line. The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, each not exceeding 1000. The function then counts the occurrences of each unique integer and writes two values to 'output.txt': the maximum frequency of any integer and the total number of unique integers. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling an empty input file or a file with invalid data formats, which are not explicitly managed by the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
