Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully adhere to the problem description. Specifically, the code assumes that the input will come from a file named 'input.txt' and the output will be written to a file named 'output.txt'. However, the problem description specifies that the input and output should be handled through standard input (`sys.stdin`) and standard output (`sys.stdout`). The code includes commented-out lines that suggest it was intended to read from and write to files, but these lines are not active, and the actual code uses `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the input is read from `sys.stdin` and written to `sys.stdout` as required. Instead, it attempts to read and write to files, which is not consistent with the problem description.

To fix this, the code should be modified to read from `sys.stdin` and write to `sys.stdout` directly, without involving file operations. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    output = sys.stdout
    input.readline()  # Read and discard the first line containing N
    woods = map(int, input.readline().strip().split())
    d = {}
    for w in woods:
        d[w] = d.get(w, 0) + 1
    output.write(f'{max(d.values())} {len(d)}\n')

func()
```

This corrected version reads the input from `sys.stdin` and writes the output to `sys.stdout`, which aligns with the problem description.
