You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Little Vasya has received a young builder’s kit. The kit consists of several wooden bars, the lengths of all of them are known. The bars can be put one on the top of the other if their lengths are the same.

Vasya wants to construct the minimal number of towers from the bars. Help Vasya to use the bars in the best way possible.

Input

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) — the number of bars at Vasya’s disposal. The second line contains N space-separated integers li — the lengths of the bars. All the lengths are natural numbers not exceeding 1000.

Output

In one line output two numbers — the height of the largest tower and their total number. Remember that Vasya should use all the bars.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, and li is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    output = sys.stdout
    """
input = open('input.txt','r')
output = open('output.txt','w')
"""
    input.readline()
    woods = map(lambda x: int(x), input.readline().strip().split(' '))
    d = {}
    for w in woods:
        d[w] = d.setdefault(w, 0) + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt', `woods` is a map object containing integers from the current line of `input`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `woods` and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `woods`. If `woods` is empty, `d` remains an empty dictionary.
    output.write('%d %d' % (max(d.values()), len(d)))
    output.close()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
