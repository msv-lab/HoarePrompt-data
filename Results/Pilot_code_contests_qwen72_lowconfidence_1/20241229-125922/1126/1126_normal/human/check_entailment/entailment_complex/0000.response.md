Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The problem description specifies that the input is read from standard input (`stdin`). However, the program is designed to read from a file named `'input.txt'` and write to a file named `'output.txt'`. This is not consistent with the problem description, which expects the program to read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The problem description requires the output to be printed in a specific format: the height of the largest tower followed by the total number of towers. The program correctly calculates these values and writes them to the output file, but it does not print them to `stdout`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that the input file exists and is correctly formatted. While the problem description states that the input will be valid, the program's reliance on file I/O instead of `stdin` and `stdout` introduces an unnecessary dependency that could lead to issues if the files are not present or are incorrectly formatted.

### Corrected Program:
To make the program correct according to the problem description, it should read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    output = sys.stdout
    
    N = int(input.readline())
    woods = list(map(int, input.readline().strip().split()))
    
    d = {}
    for w in woods:
        d[w] = d.get(w, 0) + 1
    
    max_height = max(d.values())
    num_towers = len(d)
    
    output.write(f'{max_height} {num_towers}\n')

# Example usage (for testing purposes, normally you would run this without the example input):
# sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
# sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input**: The program reads the number of bars `N` from the first line of `stdin` and the lengths of the bars from the second line.
- **Processing**: It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each bar length.
- **Output**: It calculates the height of the largest tower (the maximum value in the dictionary) and the total number of towers (the number of unique keys in the dictionary). It then writes these values to `stdout` in the required format.

By making these changes, the program now correctly follows the problem description and meets all the specified requirements.
