You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Vasya has received a young builder’s kit. The kit consists of several wooden bars, the lengths of all of them are known. The bars can be put one on the top of the other if their lengths are the same.

Vasya wants to construct the minimal number of towers from the bars. Help Vasya to use the bars in the best way possible.

Input

The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) — the number of bars at Vasya’s disposal. The second line contains N space-separated integers li — the lengths of the bars. All the lengths are natural numbers not exceeding 1000.

Output

In one line output two numbers — the height of the largest tower and their total number. Remember that Vasya should use all the bars.

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin
    output = sys.stdout
    "\ninput = open('input.txt','r')\noutput = open('output.txt','w')\n"
    input.readline()
    woods = map(lambda x: int(x), input.readline().strip().split(' '))
    d = {}
    for w in woods:
        d[w] = d.setdefault(w, 0) + 1
    output.write('%d %d' % (max(d.values()), len(d)))
    output.close()


```
Output hints: The function reads from a file named 'input.txt' and writes to a file named 'output.txt'. It expects the first line of 'input.txt' to contain an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) indicating the number of integers in the subsequent line. The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, each not exceeding 1000. The function then counts the occurrences of each unique integer and writes two values to 'output.txt': the maximum frequency of any integer and the total number of unique integers. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling an empty input file or a file with invalid data formats, which are not explicitly managed by the code.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
