The function reads from a file named 'input.txt' and writes to a file named 'output.txt'. It expects the first line of 'input.txt' to contain an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) indicating the number of integers in the subsequent line. The second line contains `N` space-separated integers, each not exceeding 1000. The function then counts the occurrences of each unique integer and writes two values to 'output.txt': the maximum frequency of any integer and the total number of unique integers. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling an empty input file or a file with invalid data formats, which are not explicitly managed by the code.
