The line of code reads a line from the `input` file object, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into substrings using spaces as delimiters, and maps these substrings to integers. This mapped object is stored in the variable `woods`.

- `N` remains unchanged as an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.
- `li` remains a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000.
- The `input` file object's pointer is advanced to the next line in 'input.txt'.
- `output` remains a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt'.
- `woods` is now a map object that contains integers converted from the space-separated values read from the current line of the input file.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt', `woods` is a map object containing integers from the current line of `input`.**
