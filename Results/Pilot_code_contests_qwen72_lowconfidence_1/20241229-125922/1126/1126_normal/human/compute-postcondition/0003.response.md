The line `input.readline()` reads one line from the file object `input` which is pointing to 'input.txt'. This operation advances the file pointer to the next line in the file, and the content of the read line is not stored in any variable in this snippet. The other variables (`N`, `li`, and `output`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt'**
