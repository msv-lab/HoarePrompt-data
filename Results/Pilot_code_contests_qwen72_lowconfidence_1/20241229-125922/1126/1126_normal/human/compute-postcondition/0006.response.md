To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions necessary for the loop to run:

1. **`woods` must be iterable**: The loop `for w in woods:` will only execute if `woods` is an iterable object. Since `woods` is described as a map object containing integers from the current line of `input`, we need to ensure that `woods` is not empty.

2. **Current line in `input` must contain data**: For `woods` to contain integers, the current line in the `input` file must contain data that can be converted into integers. This implies that the file `input.txt` should have at least one line that is not empty and contains valid integer data.

3. **`woods` should be initialized correctly**: The map object `woods` should be correctly initialized with the integers from the current line of `input`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

- **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000**: This remains unchanged as it is a given condition.
- **`li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000**: This remains unchanged as it is a given condition.
- **`input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line**: This remains unchanged as it is a given condition.
- **`output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt'**: This remains unchanged as it is a given condition.
- **`woods` is a map object containing integers from the current line of `input`**: To ensure the loop can execute, `woods` must contain at least one integer. This means the current line in `input` must contain at least one valid integer.
- **`d` is an empty dictionary**: This remains unchanged as it is a given condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt', `woods` is a map object containing at least one integer from the current line of `input`, `d` is an empty dictionary**
