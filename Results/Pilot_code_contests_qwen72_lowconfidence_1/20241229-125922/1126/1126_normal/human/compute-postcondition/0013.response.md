The code snippet writes to the `output` file object. It uses the `write` method to output a string formatted with two values: the maximum value from the dictionary `d`'s values (which represents the highest frequency of any integer in `woods`), and the length of the dictionary `d` (which represents the number of unique integers in `woods`).

The variables `N`, `li`, `input`, `woods`, and `d` remain unchanged by this operation. However, the `output` file's content is modified. Since the exact content written depends on the current state of `d`, the output state reflects this action.

Output State: **`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt' with the content '%d %d' % (max(d.values()), len(d)) appended, `woods` is a map object containing integers from the current line of `input`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `woods` and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in `woods`. If `woods` is empty, `d` remains an empty dictionary.**
