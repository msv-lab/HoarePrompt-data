The code snippet changes the values of `input` and `output` to file objects. Specifically, `input` is now a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt', and `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt'. The values of `N` and `li` remain unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt', `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt'**
