The code `d[w] = d.setdefault(w, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the value of the key `w` to the current value of `d[w]` plus 1, or to 1 if `w` is not already a key in `d`.

- If `w` is already a key in `d`, its value is incremented by 1.
- If `w` is not a key in `d`, a new key `w` is added with a value of 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`N` is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, `li` is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is a file object opened in read mode pointing to 'input.txt' with the file pointer advanced to the next line, `output` is a file object opened in write mode pointing to 'output.txt', `woods` is a map object containing at least two integers from the current line of `input`, `d` now contains the key `w` with a value of 1 or the value of `d[w]` is incremented by 1.**
