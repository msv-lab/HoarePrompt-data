The line of code `input = sys.stdin` assigns the standard input stream object (`sys.stdin`) to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of `N` or `li`. The state of the program remains the same except for this new assignment.

Output State: **N is an integer where 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, and li is a list of N integers where each integer is a natural number not exceeding 1000, `input` is `sys.stdin`**
