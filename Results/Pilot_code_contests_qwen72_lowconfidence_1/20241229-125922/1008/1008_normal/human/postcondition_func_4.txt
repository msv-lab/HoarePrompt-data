The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both expected to be positive integers. It returns the integer division result of `(x * y)` by the value returned from `func_4(x, y)`. If `func_4(x, y)` returns 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur. Additionally, if `x` or `y` are not positive integers, the behavior is undefined and could lead to unexpected results or errors.
