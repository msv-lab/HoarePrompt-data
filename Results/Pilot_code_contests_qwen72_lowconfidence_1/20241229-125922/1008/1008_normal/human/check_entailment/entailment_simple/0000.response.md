Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the solution for the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the dimensions of the rectangle table (`rows` and `cols`) and the number of tubes (`k`) using `func_1()`. This function reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a tuple of integers.

2. **Zigzag Pattern Generation**: The program generates a zigzag pattern to fill the entire table with cells. This is done by iterating over each row and appending the cells in alternating directions (left-to-right for even-indexed rows and right-to-left for odd-indexed rows). The cells are stored in the `store` list.

3. **Tube Placement**:
   - The program prints the first `k-1` tubes, each containing exactly 2 cells. This is achieved by printing pairs of consecutive cells from the `store` list.
   - For the last tube, the program prints the remaining cells in the `store` list. This ensures that all cells are used and that the last tube contains the correct number of cells to cover the remaining cells.

4. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem description:
   - Each tube is printed on a separate line.
   - The first number in each line is the number of cells in the tube.
   - The subsequent numbers are the coordinates of the cells in the tube, formatted as `x1 y1 x2 y2 ...`.

5. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description:
   - The number of rows and columns is between 2 and 300.
   - The number of tubes `k` is such that `2k` is less than or equal to the total number of cells in the table.

By following this approach, the program ensures that:
- No two tubes share any cells.
- All cells of the table belong to some tube.
- The tubes are arranged in a fancy manner as required.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
