You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valera has got a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Valera numbered the table rows starting from one, from top to bottom and the columns – starting from one, from left to right. We will represent cell that is on the intersection of row x and column y by a pair of integers (x, y).

Valera wants to place exactly k tubes on his rectangle table. A tube is such sequence of table cells (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xr, yr), that: 

  * r ≥ 2; 
  * for any integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ r - 1) the following equation |xi - xi + 1| + |yi - yi + 1| = 1 holds; 
  * each table cell, which belongs to the tube, must occur exactly once in the sequence. 



Valera thinks that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner if the following conditions are fulfilled: 

  * no pair of tubes has common cells; 
  * each cell of the table belongs to some tube. 



Help Valera to arrange k tubes on his rectangle table in a fancy manner.

Input

The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 300; 2 ≤ 2k ≤ n·m) — the number of rows, the number of columns and the number of tubes, correspondingly. 

Output

Print k lines. In the i-th line print the description of the i-th tube: first print integer ri (the number of tube cells), then print 2ri integers xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2, ..., xiri, yiri (the sequence of table cells).

If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. 

Examples

Input

3 3 3


Output

3 1 1 1 2 1 3
3 2 1 2 2 2 3
3 3 1 3 2 3 3


Input

2 3 1


Output

6 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 2 2 1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of cells in the last tube is less than 2, which violates the requirement that each tube must contain at least two cells. Specifically, the program always prints the last tube with the remaining cells, but if the remaining cells are less than 2, this would be incorrect. For example, consider the input `3 3 4`. The total number of cells is 9, and the program tries to create 4 tubes. After creating 3 tubes with 2 cells each, only 1 cell remains for the last tube, which is not valid since a tube must have at least 2 cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function `func_1`. This function reads input from standard input (stdin) and returns a map object containing integers parsed from the input. The input is expected to be a single line of space-separated integers.
def func_1():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing integers parsed from a single line of space-separated integers read from standard input (stdin).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain space-separated integers. It parses these integers and returns a map object containing the parsed integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the returned map object will be empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It converts these integers from strings to integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle multiple lines of input or any other form of input validation.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_3():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a line of input from the standard input (stdin) with trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns the line with trailing whitespace removed. If the input is empty or only contains whitespace, the function will return an empty string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers and zero, correctly computing the GCD in all cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both expected to be positive integers. It returns the integer division result of `(x * y)` by the value returned from `func_4(x, y)`. If `func_4(x, y)` returns 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur. Additionally, if `x` or `y` are not positive integers, the behavior is undefined and could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
