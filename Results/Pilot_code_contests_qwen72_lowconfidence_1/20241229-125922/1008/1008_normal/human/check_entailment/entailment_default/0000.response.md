Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_6` is intended to place exactly `k` tubes on a rectangle table with `n` rows and `m` columns such that each cell of the table belongs to exactly one tube and no two tubes share any cells. However, the implementation of `func_6` does not always ensure that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner as described in the problem statement.

Specifically, the function constructs the tubes by alternating the direction of traversal (left-to-right and right-to-left) across the rows. While this approach ensures that all cells are covered, it does not guarantee that the tubes are of the correct length or that they do not overlap in certain edge cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3 2
```
The expected output should be two tubes that cover all 9 cells without overlapping. However, the current implementation will produce:
```
2 1 1 1 2
2 1 3 2 1
2 2 3 3 1
2 3 3 3 2
```
This output is incorrect because it creates more than `k` tubes and does not cover all cells with exactly `k` tubes.

Another issue is that the function assumes that the last tube will always be large enough to cover the remaining cells, which is not necessarily true for all inputs. For example, if `k` is very close to `n * m / 2`, the last tube might not have enough cells to form a valid tube.

Therefore, the function does not meet the problem specification for every potential case, making it incorrect.
