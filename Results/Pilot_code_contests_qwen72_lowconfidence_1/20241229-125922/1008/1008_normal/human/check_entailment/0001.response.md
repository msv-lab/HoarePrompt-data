Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of cells in the last tube is less than 2, which violates the requirement that each tube must contain at least two cells. Specifically, the program always prints the last tube with the remaining cells, but if the remaining cells are less than 2, this would be incorrect. For example, consider the input `3 3 4`. The total number of cells is 9, and the program tries to create 4 tubes. After creating 3 tubes with 2 cells each, only 1 cell remains for the last tube, which is not valid since a tube must have at least 2 cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
