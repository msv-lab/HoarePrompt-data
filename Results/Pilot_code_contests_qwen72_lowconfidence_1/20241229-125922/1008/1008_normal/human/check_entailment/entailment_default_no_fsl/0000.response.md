Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_6` does not always produce the correct output for every potential case as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner, meaning that no two tubes share common cells and each cell of the table belongs to exactly one tube.

### Issues:
1. **Tube Length and Distribution:**
   - The function always starts by creating tubes of length 2 until it has created `k-1` tubes. This means that the last tube will often be much longer than the others, which is not necessarily a problem, but it does not ensure that the tubes are distributed evenly across the table.
   - The function does not check if the remaining cells can form a valid tube. For example, if the remaining cells are not contiguous, the last tube may not be valid.

2. **Fancy Arrangement:**
   - The function does not ensure that no two tubes share common cells. Since the function appends cells to the `store` list in a sequential manner, it is possible that the last tube might overlap with the earlier tubes, especially if the remaining cells are not contiguous.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
3 3 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
3 1 1 1 2 1 3
3 2 1 2 2 2 3
3 3 1 3 2 3 3
```
However, the actual output from `func_6` might be:
```
2 1 1 1 2
2 1 3 2 1
4 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2
```
In this case, the last tube is not of length 3, and the distribution of cells is not even. Moreover, the function does not ensure that the tubes are arranged in a fancy manner, as the last tube might overlap with the earlier tubes.

Therefore, the function `func_6` does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
