The function `func_1` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), which is expected to contain space-separated integers. It parses these integers and returns a map object containing the parsed integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the returned map object will be empty.
