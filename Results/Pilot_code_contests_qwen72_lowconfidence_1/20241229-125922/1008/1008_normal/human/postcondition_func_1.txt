The function `func_2` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It converts these integers from strings to integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input line is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle multiple lines of input or any other form of input validation.
