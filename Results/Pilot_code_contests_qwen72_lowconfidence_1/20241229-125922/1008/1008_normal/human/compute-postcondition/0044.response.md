To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`.
- `j` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `cols`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented from 0 to 1.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `j`.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`, `j` is 1**
