To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

- The loop iterates over `j` from `cols - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `cols - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `cols - 2`.
- The loop condition is `j >= 0`, so `cols - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `j` is now `cols - 2`.
- Since `cols` must be at least 1, and `j` is `cols - 2`, `cols` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is [[1, cols]], `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 2`, `cols` must be at least 2**
