The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list containing the values `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1

So, the new list appended to `store` is `[2, 2]`. The `store` list initially contains `[2, 1]`, and after appending `[2, 2]`, it becomes `[[2, 1], [2, 2]]`.

The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `j`, `turn`) are not modified by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the elements [[2, 1], [2, 2]], `j` is 1**.
