The value of `i` is set to 0. The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` remain unchanged. The list `store` also remains unchanged, containing the zigzag pattern of coordinates based on the initial values of `rows` and `cols`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern: for even `i`, `[[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], ..., [i + 1, cols]]`, and for odd `i`, `[[i + 1, cols], [i + 1, cols - 1], ..., [i + 1, 1]]`.**
