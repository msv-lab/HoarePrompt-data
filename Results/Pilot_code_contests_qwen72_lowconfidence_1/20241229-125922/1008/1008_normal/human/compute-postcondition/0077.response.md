The code snippet `print(*store[i + 1])` prints the elements of the tuple at index `i + 1` in the list `store`. Given that `i` is 4, this means the code will print the elements of the tuple at index 5 in `store`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `i + 1` evaluates to `4 + 1`, which is 5.
- The fifth element (index 5) of `store` is printed.

Since the code only involves printing and does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged. However, the sixth pair of coordinates from `store` has now been printed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 3, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 4, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 2, 2 has been printed three times, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the third pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the fourth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the fifth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the sixth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
