To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < rows * cols`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 1`.
   - `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd.
   - `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern.
   - `count` is `k` - 1.
   - 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times.
   - The first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed.
   - `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space.
   - If `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space, and `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The key condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be less than `rows * cols`.
   - Given that `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 1`, we need to ensure that this value is less than `rows * cols`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is already defined as `2 * (k - 1) + 1`, we need to ensure that `2 * (k - 1) + 1 < rows * cols`.
   - This condition is already satisfied given the constraints on `k` and `rows * cols`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are needed to the state variables for the loop to execute one more time, as the condition `i < rows * cols` is already met.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 1`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space. If `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space, and `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.**
