The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so the new list appended will be `[1, 3]`. The `store` list will now be `[[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
