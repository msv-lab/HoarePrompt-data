Functionality: ** The function `func_6` generates and prints a sequence of numbers and coordinates based on the parameters `rows`, `cols`, and `k` provided by the function `func_1()`. The function performs the following actions:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function implicitly accepts three parameters: `rows`, `cols`, and `k` through the call to `func_1()`. These parameters are positive integers such that `2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300` and `2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols`.

2. **Zigzag Pattern Generation**: It generates a list `store` containing pairs of coordinates `[i + 1, j + 1]` in a zigzag pattern across the grid defined by `rows` and `cols`. For each row `i`:
   - If `i` is even, the coordinates are added from left to right.
   - If `i` is odd, the coordinates are added from right to left.

3. **Printing the Zigzag Pattern**:
   - The function prints `2` followed by pairs of coordinates from `store` until `k - 1` pairs have been printed. Each pair is printed on a new line.
   - After printing `k - 1` pairs, the function prints the number of remaining cells in the grid (`rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)`) followed by the remaining coordinates from `store`.

4. **Final State**:
   - The variables `rows`, `cols`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - The variable `curr_x` and `curr_y` are both `0` (but they are not used in the function).
   - The variable `turn` is `0` if `rows` is even and `1` if `rows` is odd.
   - The variable `i` is equal to `rows * cols`.
   - The list `store` contains the generated zigzag pattern of coordinates.
   - The function prints a total of `rows * cols` elements, where the first `2 * (k - 1)` elements are printed in pairs, and the remaining elements are printed individually.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 1, only the first pair of coordinates is printed, and the remaining cells in the grid are printed as a single number followed by the rest of the coordinates.
   - If `rows * cols` is exactly `2 * (k - 1)`, the function will print the first `2 * (k - 1)` pairs and then print `0` (since there are no remaining cells).

6. **Missing Functionality**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1 or greater than half the total number of cells (`rows * cols / 2`). This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if such values are provided by `func_1()`. **

This summary covers the functionality of the function, including its input parameters, the zigzag pattern generation, the printing logic, and the final state of the program. It also highlights potential edge cases and missing functionality. **
