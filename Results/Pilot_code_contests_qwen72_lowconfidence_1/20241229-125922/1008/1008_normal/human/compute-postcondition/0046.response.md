According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `cols`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition `j < cols` must still hold true, meaning `cols` must be greater than 2.

The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `store`) do not affect the execution of this particular loop, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]`, `j` is 2, `cols` must be greater than 2**
