To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior over all its iterations. Let's break down the loop and the changes it makes to the variables:

### Initial State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- `store` remains the same as in the initial state.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop iterates `cols` times, where `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`.

2. **Changes in Variables**:
   - For each iteration `j`, the loop appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`.
   - `i` remains constant throughout the loop (it is 1).
   - `j` increments from 0 to `cols - 1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `store` will contain `cols` elements, each of the form `[2, j + 1]` where `j` ranges from 0 to `cols - 1`.
   - The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
   - `turn` remains toggled as it was after the initial state.
   - `j` will be `cols - 1` after the loop completes.

### Output State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- `store` contains the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]`.
- `j` is `cols - 1`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]`, `j` is `cols - 1`.**
