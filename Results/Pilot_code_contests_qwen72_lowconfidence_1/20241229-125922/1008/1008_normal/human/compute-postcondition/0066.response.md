The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `i` was 0, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 0, 2 has been printed, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
