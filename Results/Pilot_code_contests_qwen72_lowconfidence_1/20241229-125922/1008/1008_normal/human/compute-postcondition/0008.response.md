According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `cols`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `cols`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `cols` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is [[1, 1]], `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
