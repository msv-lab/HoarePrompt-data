The code snippet assigns new values to `rows`, `cols`, and `k` using the function `func_1()`. The specific values of `rows`, `cols`, and `k` after the execution depend on the return values of `func_1()`. However, the constraints on these variables remain the same: `rows` and `cols` are positive integers between 2 and 300, and `2k` is a positive integer that is less than or equal to `rows * cols`.

Output State: **`rows`, `cols`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, with new values assigned from `func_1()`**.
