Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`, and `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively.***
