The value of `turn` is toggled using the XOR operation with 1 (`turn ^= 1`). This means if `turn` was 0, it becomes 1, and if `turn` was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the same list as before, `j` remains the same (`cols - 1` if `turn` was initially 0, and `-1` if `turn` was initially 1).**
