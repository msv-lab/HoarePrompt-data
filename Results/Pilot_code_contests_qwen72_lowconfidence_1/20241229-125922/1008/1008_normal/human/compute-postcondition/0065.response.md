The code snippet `print(*store[i + 1])` prints the second pair of coordinates from the list `store`. The variables `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `count` remain unchanged. The only change is that the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 0, 2 has been printed, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
