The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so the new element appended to `store` is `[1, 2]`. The `store` list now contains two elements: `[[1, 1], [1, 2]]`.

The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is [[1, 1], [1, 2]], `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
