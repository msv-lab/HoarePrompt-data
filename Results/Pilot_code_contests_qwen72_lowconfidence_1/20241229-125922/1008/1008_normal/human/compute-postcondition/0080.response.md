To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the changes in the variables after each iteration and consider the conditions under which the loop terminates.

### Initial State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd.
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern: for even `i`, `[[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], ..., [i + 1, cols]]`, and for odd `i`, `[[i + 1, cols], [i + 1, cols - 1], ..., [i + 1, 1]]`.
- `count` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
while count < k - 1:
    print(2, end=' ')
    print(*store[i], end=' ')
    print(*store[i + 1])
    i += 2
    count += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs as long as `count` is less than `k - 1`.
- Each iteration of the loop prints "2" followed by the coordinates at `store[i]` and `store[i + 1]`.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 and `count` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will terminate when `count` reaches `k - 1`.
- Therefore, after the loop has finished executing, `count` will be `k - 1`.
- The value of `i` will be `2 * (k - 1)` because `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.
- The values of `rows`, `cols`, `curr_x`, and `curr_y` remain unchanged.
- The value of `turn` remains the same as it was initially.
- The `store` list remains unchanged.

### Output State:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1), `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, and the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed.**
