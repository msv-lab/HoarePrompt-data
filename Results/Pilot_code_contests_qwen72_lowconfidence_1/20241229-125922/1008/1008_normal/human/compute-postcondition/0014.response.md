To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over `j` from `cols - 1` down to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
   - This means the loop will execute if `cols - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `cols` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to `cols - 1`.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`rows`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`, and `i`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition. They remain as they are.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `cols` must be at least 1. The initial value of `j` should be `cols - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 1`, `cols` must be at least 1**
