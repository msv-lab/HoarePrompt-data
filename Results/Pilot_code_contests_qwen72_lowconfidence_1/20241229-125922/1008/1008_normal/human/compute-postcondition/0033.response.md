The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is `cols - 1`. Therefore, the list `[2, cols]` is appended to `store`.

The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated with `[2, cols]` appended, `j` is `cols - 1`**
