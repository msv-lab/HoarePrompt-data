To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates over the range from `cols - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. For this loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`cols - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (`-1`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Starting Value**: The loop starts at `cols - 1`.
2. **Ending Value**: The loop ends at `-1`.
3. **Step**: The step is `-1`, meaning the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration.

For the loop to execute at least once, the following condition must be true:
- `cols - 1 >= 0`

Simplifying this condition:
- `cols - 1 >= 0`
- `cols >= 1`

Given the initial state:
- `cols` is a positive integer such that `2 ≤ cols ≤ 300`.

Since `cols` is already guaranteed to be at least 2, the condition `cols >= 1` is always satisfied. Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

### States That Need to Be Adjusted:
- The loop will execute as long as `cols` is at least 1, which is already satisfied by the given constraints.
- No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

However, we need to ensure that the initial state is correctly set up for the loop to start. Specifically:
- `j` should start at `cols - 1`.
- The other variables (`rows`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, `store`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but should be noted as part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` remains the same as in the initial state, `j` is `cols - 1`**
