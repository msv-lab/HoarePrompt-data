The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. The values of `i` and `j` are used in this calculation, where `i` is 0 and `j` is `cols - 2`. Therefore, the new element added to `store` will be `[1, cols - 1]`.

The initial state is updated as follows:
- `store` now includes the new list `[1, cols - 1]`.
- The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is [[1, cols], [1, cols - 1]], `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 2`, `cols` must be at least 2**
