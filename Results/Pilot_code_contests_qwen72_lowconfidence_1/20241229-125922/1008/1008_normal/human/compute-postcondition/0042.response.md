To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`.
- `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for j in range(cols):` will execute `cols` times, starting from `j = 0` and ending at `j = cols - 1`.
- For the loop to execute, `cols` must be greater than 0. This is already satisfied by the given condition that `2 ≤ cols ≤ 300`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `j` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `store`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they do not affect the loop's initialization.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`, and `j` is 0**.
