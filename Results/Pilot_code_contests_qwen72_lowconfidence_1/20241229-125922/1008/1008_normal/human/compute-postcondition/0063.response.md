The code `print(2, end=' ')` prints the number 2 followed by a space without moving to the next line. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the number 2 has been printed.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 0, 2 has been printed.**
