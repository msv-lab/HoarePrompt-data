The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new element to the list `store`. This new element is a list containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `j` is `cols - 2`, so `j + 1` is `cols - 1`.

Thus, the new element appended to `store` is `[3, cols - 1]`.

The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]`, and `j` is `cols - 2`**.
