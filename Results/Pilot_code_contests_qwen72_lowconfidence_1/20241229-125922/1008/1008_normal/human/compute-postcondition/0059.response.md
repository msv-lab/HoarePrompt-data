To determine the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand how the variables change over time.

### Initial State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is 0.
- `store` is an empty list.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `rows` times, and within each iteration, it either appends elements to `store` in a forward direction (from 0 to `cols` - 1) or in a backward direction (from `cols` - 1 to 0), depending on the value of `turn`.

1. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - If `turn` is 0 (initially true):
     - For `j` in range `cols`:
       - Append `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`.
     - After the inner loop, `store` contains `[[1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [1, cols]]`.
   - Toggle `turn` using `turn ^= 1`, so `turn` becomes 1.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - If `turn` is 1:
     - For `j` in range `cols - 1` to -1 (backwards):
       - Append `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`.
     - After the inner loop, `store` contains `[[1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [1, cols], [2, cols], [2, cols - 1], ..., [2, 1]]`.
   - Toggle `turn` using `turn ^= 1`, so `turn` becomes 0.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - If `turn` is 0:
     - For `j` in range `cols`:
       - Append `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`.
     - After the inner loop, `store` contains `[[1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [1, cols], [2, cols], [2, cols - 1], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], ..., [3, cols]]`.
   - Toggle `turn` using `turn ^= 1`, so `turn` becomes 1.

4. **General Pattern:**
   - For each even `i` (i.e., `i` is 0, 2, 4, ...):
     - `store` is appended with elements in the forward direction: `[[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], ..., [i + 1, cols]]`.
   - For each odd `i` (i.e., `i` is 1, 3, 5, ...):
     - `store` is appended with elements in the backward direction: `[[i + 1, cols], [i + 1, cols - 1], ..., [i + 1, 1]]`.

### Final State:
After the loop completes `rows` iterations:
- `rows` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
- `curr_x` remains 0.
- `curr_y` remains 0.
- `i` is `rows - 1` (the last value of `i` in the loop).
- `turn` is toggled based on the parity of `rows`:
  - If `rows` is even, `turn` is 0.
  - If `rows` is odd, `turn` is 1.
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern:
  - For even `i`: `[[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], ..., [i + 1, cols]]`.
  - For odd `i`: `[[i + 1, cols], [i + 1, cols - 1], ..., [i + 1, 1]]`.

### Output State:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `rows - 1`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern: for even `i`, `[[i + 1, 1], [i + 1, 2], ..., [i + 1, cols]]`, and for odd `i`, `[[i + 1, cols], [i + 1, cols - 1], ..., [i + 1, 1]]`.**
