To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables.

### Initial State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is an empty list

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    store.append([i + 1, j + 1])
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to 0 (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` is appended to `store`.
- `i` is fixed at 1 throughout the loop.
- The loop will run exactly `cols` times because `range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` generates `cols` values for `j`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- After the loop completes, `store` will contain `cols` elements.
- Each element in `store` will be of the form `[2, j + 1]` where `j` ranges from `cols - 1` down to 0.
- Therefore, `store` will contain the following elements in order: `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`.

### Final Values of Variables:
- `rows` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` remains 0
- `curr_y` remains 0
- `i` remains 1
- `turn` remains 1
- `store` is updated to contain the list of pairs: `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`
- `j` is -1 (since the loop ends when `j` is decremented to -1)

### Output State:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated to contain the list of pairs: `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`, `j` is -1.**
