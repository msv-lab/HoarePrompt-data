To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition of the `while` loop: `i < rows * cols`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1)
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern
- `count` is `k` - 1
- 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times
- The first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed
- `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space

We need to ensure that `i` is less than `rows * cols` for the loop to execute at least once.

Let's analyze the values:
- `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1)
- `rows * cols` is the total number of cells in the grid

Since `2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols`, we can deduce that:
- `2 * (k - 1) < rows * cols`

This inequality ensures that `i` is less than `rows * cols`, meaning the loop condition `i < rows * cols` is satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1), `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, and the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space.**
