The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is `cols - 1`. Therefore, the new element appended to `store` will be `[3, cols]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols]`, and `j` is `cols - 1`**
