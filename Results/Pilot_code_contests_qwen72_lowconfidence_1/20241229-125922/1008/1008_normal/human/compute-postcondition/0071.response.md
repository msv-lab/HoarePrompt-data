The code snippet `print(*store[i + 1])` will print the fourth pair of coordinates from the `store` list (since `i` is 2 and `i + 1` is 3).

- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `count`, and the contents of `store` remain unchanged.
- The output includes the third and fourth pairs of coordinates from `store`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 1, 2 has been printed twice, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the third pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the fourth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
