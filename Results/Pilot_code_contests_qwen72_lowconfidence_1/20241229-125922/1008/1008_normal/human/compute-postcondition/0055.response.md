The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new element to the list `store`. The new element is a list containing two integers: `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `turn` is 1
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]`
- `j` is `cols - 3`

Calculating the new value:
- `i + 1` is `2 + 1`, which is `3`
- `j + 1` is `(cols - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `cols - 2`

Therefore, the new element appended to `store` is `[3, cols - 2]`.

The output state is:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `turn` is 1
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1], [3, cols - 2]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1], [3, cols - 2]`
- `j` is `cols - 3`

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1], [3, cols - 2]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1], [3, cols - 2]`, `j` is `cols - 3`**
