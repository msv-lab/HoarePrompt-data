The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are known (`i` is 0 and `j` is `cols - 3`), so the new list being appended is `[1, cols - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is [[1, cols], [1, cols - 1], [1, cols - 2]], `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 3`, `cols` must be at least 2**
