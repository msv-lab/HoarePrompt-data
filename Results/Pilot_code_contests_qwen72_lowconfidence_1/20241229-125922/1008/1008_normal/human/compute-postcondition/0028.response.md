According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `cols`. If `j` is less than `cols`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `j` becomes 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `cols` must be greater than 2.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the elements [[2, 1], [2, 2]], `j` is 2, `cols` must be greater than 2**
