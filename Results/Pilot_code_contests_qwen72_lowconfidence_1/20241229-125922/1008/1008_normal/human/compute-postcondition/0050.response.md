To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `turn` is 1
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`
- `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1)` will iterate over `j` from `cols - 1` down to 0 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: For the loop to execute, `j` must start at `cols - 1` and go down to 0. This means `j` must be `cols - 1` at the start of the loop.
3. **Dependency on `cols`**: The loop will execute if `cols` is at least 1. Given that `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, this condition is already satisfied.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j` must be `cols - 1`**: This is crucial for the loop to start iterating from `cols - 1` down to 0.
- **No other adjustments are needed**: The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `store`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`, and `j` is `cols - 1`**.
