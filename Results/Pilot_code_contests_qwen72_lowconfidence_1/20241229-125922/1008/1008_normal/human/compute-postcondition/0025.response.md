The code snippet appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 1 and the value of `j` is 0. Therefore, the list `[2, 1]` is appended to `store`. The values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the additional element `[2, 1]`, `j` is 0**
