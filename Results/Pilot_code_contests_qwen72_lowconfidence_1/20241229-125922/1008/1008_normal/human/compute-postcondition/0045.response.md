The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list containing the values `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `j` is 1

The expression `[i + 1, j + 1]` evaluates to `[3, 2]`. Therefore, the new list `[3, 2]` is appended to `store`.

Since the initial state specifies that `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`, appending `[3, 2]` results in:

- If `store` initially contained `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]`, it now contains `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2]]`.
- If `store` initially contained `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`, it now contains `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]`.

The values of the other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]`, `j` is 1**
