Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` remains the same as in the initial state, and `turn` is 1***
