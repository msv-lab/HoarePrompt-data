The function `func_6` does not explicitly show parameters in its definition. However, based on the given parameter constraints and the typical structure of functions, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `rows`, `cols`, and `k`. These parameters are positive integers where `2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300` and `2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols`.

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit output information in the provided snippet, we need to infer the expected behavior from the context:

- The function accepts three parameters: `rows`, `cols`, and `k`.
- The parameters `rows` and `cols` define the dimensions of a grid or matrix, and `k` is an integer that relates to some property or operation within this grid.
- The function's output is not explicitly stated, but based on common programming patterns, it could be returning some computed value or a modified version of the input parameters.

Without more specific details about the output, the most accurate description of the function's functionality is:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `rows`, `cols`, and `k`, which are positive integers such that `2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300` and `2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols`. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
