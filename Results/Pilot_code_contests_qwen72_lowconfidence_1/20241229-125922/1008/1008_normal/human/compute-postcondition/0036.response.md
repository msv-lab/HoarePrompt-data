To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `j` starts at `cols - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0 (inclusive).

2. **Current State**:
   - `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
   - `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
   - `curr_x` is 0.
   - `curr_y` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `turn` is 1.
   - `store` is updated with `[2, cols]` and `[2, cols - 1]` appended.
   - `j` is `cols - 2`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the range defined by the loop condition.
   - The current value of `j` is `cols - 2`.
   - The next value of `j` will be `cols - 3`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` is decremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `cols - 3`.
   - All other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `store`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated with `[2, cols]` and `[2, cols - 1]` appended, `j` is `cols - 3`**
