To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `turn` is 1
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]`
- `j` is `cols - 2`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `cols - 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1.
- The new value of `j` should be `cols - 3`.

### Updated State:
- `rows` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` remains 0
- `curr_y` remains 0
- `i` remains 2
- `turn` remains 1
- `store` remains as it was
- `j` is now `cols - 3`

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols], [3, cols - 1]`, and `j` is `cols - 3`**
