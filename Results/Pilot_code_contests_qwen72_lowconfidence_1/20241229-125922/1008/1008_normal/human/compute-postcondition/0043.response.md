The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state, let's determine the new state:

- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`.

After appending `[i + 1, j + 1]` to `store`, the new element `[3, 1]` will be added to the end of `store`.

The updated state is:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`.
- `j` is 0.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1]`, `j` is 0**.
