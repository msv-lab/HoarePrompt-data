The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2

The new list to be appended is `[1 + 1, 2 + 1]`, which evaluates to `[2, 3]`.

The updated `store` list will be `[[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]]`.

The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `j`, `turn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the elements [[2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3]], `j` is 2, `cols` must be greater than 2**
