The code snippet prints the fifth element of the `store` list, which contains pairs of coordinates representing a zigzag pattern. Since the code only involves printing and does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 3, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 4, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 2, 2 has been printed three times, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the third pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the fourth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the fifth pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed**
