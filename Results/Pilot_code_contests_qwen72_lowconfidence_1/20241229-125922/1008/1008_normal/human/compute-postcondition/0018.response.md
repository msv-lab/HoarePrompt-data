To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `turn` is 1
- `store` is [[1, cols], [1, cols - 1]]
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `cols - 2`
- `cols` must be at least 2

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` starting from `cols - 1` down to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `cols - 2`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` should be `cols - 3`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` must be `cols - 3` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is [[1, cols], [1, cols - 1]], `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 3`, `cols` must be at least 2**
