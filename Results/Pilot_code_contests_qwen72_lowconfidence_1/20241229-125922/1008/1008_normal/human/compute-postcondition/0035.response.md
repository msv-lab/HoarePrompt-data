The code snippet `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new list to the `store` list, which contains the values `[i + 1, j + 1]`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is `cols - 2`

Therefore, the new list appended to `store` is `[1 + 1, (cols - 2) + 1]`, which simplifies to `[2, cols - 1]`.

The `store` list was initially updated with `[2, cols]`, so after the code execution, `store` will contain both `[2, cols]` and `[2, cols - 1]`.

The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated with `[2, cols]` and `[2, cols - 1]` appended, `j` is `cols - 2`**
