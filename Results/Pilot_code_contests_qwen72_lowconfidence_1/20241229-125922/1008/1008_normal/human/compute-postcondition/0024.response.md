To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0)
- `store` remains the same as in the initial state

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `cols` is greater than 0. Since `cols` is a positive integer between 2 and 300, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.
- The variable `j` will start from 0 and iterate up to `cols - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The state `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, but it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
- The other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, `store`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` remains the same as in the initial state, `j` is 0**
