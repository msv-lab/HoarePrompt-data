Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2], ..., [3, cols]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], ..., [3, cols]`, `j` is `cols - 1`.**
