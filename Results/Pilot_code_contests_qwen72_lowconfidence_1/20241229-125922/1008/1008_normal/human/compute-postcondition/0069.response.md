The code snippet `print(2, end=' ')` prints the number 2 followed by a space without moving to a new line. This action does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional effect of printing 2.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 1, 2 has been printed twice, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
