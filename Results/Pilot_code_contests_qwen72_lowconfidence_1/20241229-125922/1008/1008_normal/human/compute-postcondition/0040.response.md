The code `turn ^= 1` toggles the value of `turn`. Since `turn` is toggled, if it was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 0.

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0)
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`
- `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively

After executing the code:
- `turn` is toggled again, so if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. This means the value of `turn` is the same as it was before the initial toggle.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 0; if `turn` was 1, it is now 1)
- `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`
- `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 0; if `turn` was 1, it is now 1), `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1]`, and `j` is either `cols - 1` or `-1` depending on whether `turn` was initially 0 or 1, respectively.**
