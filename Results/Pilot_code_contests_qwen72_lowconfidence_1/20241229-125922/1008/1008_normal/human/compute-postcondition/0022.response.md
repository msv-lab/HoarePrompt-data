The code `turn ^= 1` toggles the value of `turn` between 0 and 1 using the XOR operation. Given the initial state, we need to consider both cases for `turn`:

1. **If `turn` is 0:**
   - Before the code execution, `store` is a list containing `cols` elements, where each element is a list `[1, j + 1]` for `j` in the range 0 to `cols - 1`, and `j` is `cols - 1`.
   - After executing `turn ^= 1`, `turn` becomes 1.

2. **If `turn` is 1:**
   - Before the code execution, `store` is a list `[[1, cols], [1, cols - 1], ..., [1, 1]]`, and `j` is -1.
   - After executing `turn ^= 1`, `turn` becomes 0.

In both cases, the values of `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, and `store` remain unchanged. Only the value of `turn` is toggled.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` remains the same as in the initial state.**
