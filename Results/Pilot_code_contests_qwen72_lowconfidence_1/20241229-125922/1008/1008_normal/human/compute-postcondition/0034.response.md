According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `cols - 1` down to `0` in steps of `-1`. The loop variable `j` starts at `cols - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `cols - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` will be decremented by 1, so it will be `cols - 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated with `[2, cols]` appended, `j` is `cols - 2`**
