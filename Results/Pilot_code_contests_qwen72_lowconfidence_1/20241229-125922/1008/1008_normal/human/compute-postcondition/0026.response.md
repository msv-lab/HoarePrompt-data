To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0)
- `store` contains the additional element `[2, 1]`
- `j` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(cols):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` is initialized to 0.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `cols`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the value of `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `cols`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which will be incremented to 1. The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains the additional element `[2, 1]`, `j` is 1**
