To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, let's break down the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is `count < k - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, this condition must be true initially.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd.
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern.
- `count` is 0.

### Condition for Loop Execution:
For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `count < k - 1` must be true when the loop starts. Since `count` is 0 initially, we need to ensure that `k - 1` is greater than 0.

### Simplifying the Condition:
- `count` is 0.
- The loop condition becomes `0 < k - 1`, which simplifies to `k > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 0**.
