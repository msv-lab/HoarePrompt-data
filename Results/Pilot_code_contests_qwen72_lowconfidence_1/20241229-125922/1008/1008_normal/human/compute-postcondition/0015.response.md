The code `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends a new element to the list `store`. This element is a list containing two elements: `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `cols - 1`. Therefore, the new element appended to `store` is `[1, cols]`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 1, `store` is [[1, cols]], `i` is 0, `j` is `cols - 1`, `cols` must be at least 1**
