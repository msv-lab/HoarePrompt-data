The code snippet `store.append([i + 1, j + 1])` appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 in the initial state, the value appended to `store` is `[1, 1]`. The `store` list, which was initially empty, now contains this single element. The values of `i`, `j`, `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, and `turn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is [[1, 1]], `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
