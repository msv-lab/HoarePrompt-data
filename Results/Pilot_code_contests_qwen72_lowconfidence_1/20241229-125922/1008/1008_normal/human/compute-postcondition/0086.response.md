The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the `i`-th element of the `store` list, which is a pair of coordinates, and appends a space at the end without moving to a new line.

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1)
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern
- `count` is `k` - 1
- 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times
- The first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed
- `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space
- `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`

After executing the code:
- The `i`-th element of `store` is printed, followed by a space.
- No variables are updated by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2 * (`k` - 1), `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space, and `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.**
