The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is `cols - 3`

The new list being appended is `[1 + 1, (cols - 3) + 1]`, which simplifies to `[2, cols - 2]`.

The updated `store` list now contains `[2, cols]`, `[2, cols - 1]`, and `[2, cols - 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is 1, `store` is updated with `[2, cols]`, `[2, cols - 1]`, and `[2, cols - 2]`, `j` is `cols - 3`.**
