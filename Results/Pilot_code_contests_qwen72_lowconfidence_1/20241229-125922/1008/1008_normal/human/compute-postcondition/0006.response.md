According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cols`. The loop will execute if `cols` is at least 1. Given that `cols` is already defined as a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cols`.

The other variables (`rows`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`, and `i`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the initial state. However, for the loop to execute, the only necessary condition is that `cols` is at least 1.

Thus, the state remains unchanged except for the initialization of the loop variable `j`:

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
