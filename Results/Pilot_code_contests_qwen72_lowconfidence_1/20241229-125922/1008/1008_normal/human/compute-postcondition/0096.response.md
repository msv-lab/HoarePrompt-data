The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the `i`-th element of the `store` list, which contains pairs of coordinates, and appends a space at the end.

### Impact on Variables:
- **`store[i]`**: This specific pair of coordinates from `store` is printed.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- **Other Variables**: No other variables are directly affected by this print statement.

### Updated Values:
- The `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space.
- The value of `i` remains `2 * (k - 1) + 2`.

### Remaining Information:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`.
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd.
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern.
- `count` is `k` - 1.
- 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times.
- The first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed.
- `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space.
- The `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space.
- If `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space, if `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.**
