To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300.
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300.
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd.
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern.
- `count` is 1.
- 2 has been printed.
- The first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.
- The second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.

### Loop Condition:
```
while count < k - 1:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue as long as `count` is less than `k - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `count` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `count` must be less than `k - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `count` is 1, we need to ensure that `k - 1` is greater than 1.
- This means `k` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`. It must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 2, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 1, 2 has been printed, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed, the second pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
