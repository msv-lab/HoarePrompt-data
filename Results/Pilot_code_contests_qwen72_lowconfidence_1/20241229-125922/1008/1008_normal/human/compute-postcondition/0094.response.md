To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern
- `count` is `k` - 1
- 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times
- The first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed
- `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space
- The `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space
- If `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < rows * cols:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `rows * cols`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is still less than `rows * cols`.

### Calculation:
- `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `rows * cols`.

Since `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, we can deduce:
- `2 * (k - 1) + 2` is equivalent to `2 * k`
- Therefore, `i` is `2 * k`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `2 * k` must be less than `rows * cols`

Given that `2 * k` is already less than or equal to `rows * cols` (as per the problem constraints), the loop condition `i < rows * cols` is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time. The current state already satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 2`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space, if `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`**.
