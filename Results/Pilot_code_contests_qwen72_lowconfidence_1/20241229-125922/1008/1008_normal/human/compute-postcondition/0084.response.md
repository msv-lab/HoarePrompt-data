The code `print(*store[i])` prints the elements of the pair located at index `i` in the list `store`. Since `i` is set to `rows * cols - 1`, this means the last element in the `store` list is being printed. The values of the variables `rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, `store`, `count`, and the number of times 2 has been printed remain unchanged. The only change is that the last pair in `store` has been printed.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `rows * cols - 1`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, and the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space, the last pair in `store` has been printed.**
