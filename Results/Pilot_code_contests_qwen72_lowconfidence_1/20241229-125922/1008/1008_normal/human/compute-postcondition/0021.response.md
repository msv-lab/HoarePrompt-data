Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0. If `turn` is 0, `store` is a list containing `cols` elements, where each element is a list `[1, j + 1]` for `j` in the range 0 to `cols - 1`, and `j` is `cols - 1`. If `turn` is 1, `store` is a list `[[1, cols], [1, cols - 1], ..., [1, 1]]`, and `j` is -1.***
