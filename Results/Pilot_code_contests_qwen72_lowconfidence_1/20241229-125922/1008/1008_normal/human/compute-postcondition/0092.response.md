Postcondition: ***`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols`, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is `2 * (k - 1) + 1`, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is `k` - 1, 2 has been printed `k` - 1 times, the first 2 * (`k` - 1) pairs of coordinates from `store` have been printed, `rows * cols - 2 * (k - 1)` has been printed followed by a space, the `i`-th element of `store` has been printed followed by a space. If `i` is equal to `rows * cols - 1`, the last pair in `store` has been printed. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `rows * cols - 1`.***
