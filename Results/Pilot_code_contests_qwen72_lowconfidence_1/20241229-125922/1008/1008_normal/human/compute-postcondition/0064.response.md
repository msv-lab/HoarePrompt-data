The code snippet `print(*store[i], end=' ')` prints the elements of the list at index `i` of `store`, separated by spaces, without moving to a new line.

Given the initial state:
- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd
- `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern
- `count` is 0
- 2 has been printed

The code `print(*store[i], end=' ')` will print the first pair of coordinates from `store` without a newline, and the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the side effect of printing.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `rows` ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `cols` ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2`k` ≤ `rows` * `cols` and `k` must be greater than 1, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 0, `turn` is 0 if `rows` is even and 1 if `rows` is odd, `store` contains a list of pairs representing the coordinates in a zigzag pattern, `count` is 0, 2 has been printed, the first pair of coordinates from `store` has been printed.**
