To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300.
  - `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300.
  - `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols.
  - `curr_x` is 0.
  - `curr_y` is 0.
  - `i` is 0.
  - `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
  - `store` remains the same as in the initial state.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(rows):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:** The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `rows`.
2. **Current State:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration:** For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `rows`.

### Adjusted State:
- **`i`** is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- **`rows`** remains the same (a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300).
- **`cols`** remains the same (a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300).
- **`k`** remains the same (a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols).
- **`curr_x`** remains 0.
- **`curr_y`** remains 0.
- **`turn`** is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0).
- **`store`** remains the same as in the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 1, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` remains the same as in the initial state.**
