According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined in the loop. The loop iterates over `j` from `cols - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is `cols - 1`
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be `cols - 2`

All other variables (`rows`, `cols`, `k`, `curr_x`, `curr_y`, `i`, `turn`, `store`) remain unchanged.

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is 1, `store` contains either the elements `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, cols]]` or the list of pairs `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, cols]`, and `j` is `cols - 2`**
