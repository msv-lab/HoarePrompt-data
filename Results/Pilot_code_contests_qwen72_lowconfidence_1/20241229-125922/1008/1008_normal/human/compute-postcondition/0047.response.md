The code appends the list `[i + 1, j + 1]` to the `store` list. Given the initial state:

- `rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300
- `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300
- `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols
- `curr_x` is 0
- `curr_y` is 0
- `i` is 2
- `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0)
- `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2]`
- `j` is 2
- `cols` must be greater than 2

After executing the code:

- `store` will contain the new element `[i + 1, j + 1]`, which is `[3, 3]`.

Therefore, the updated `store` will be either:

- `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]]`
- or
- `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `i` is 2, `turn` is toggled (if `turn` was 0, it is now 1; if `turn` was 1, it is now 0), `store` contains either `[[2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, cols], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]]` or `[2, cols], [2, cols - 1], [2, cols - 2], ..., [2, 1], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3]`, `j` is 2, `cols` must be greater than 2**
