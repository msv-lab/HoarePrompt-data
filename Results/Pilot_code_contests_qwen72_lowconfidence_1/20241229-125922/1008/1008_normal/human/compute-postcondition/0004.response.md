To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(rows):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will execute if `rows` is greater than 0. Given the initial state:

- `rows`, `cols`, and `k` are positive integers such that 2 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 300 and 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, with new values assigned from `func_1()`.
- `curr_x` is 0.
- `curr_y` is 0.
- `turn` is 0.
- `store` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `rows` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `rows` is already specified to be a positive integer between 2 and 300, it meets this condition. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `rows`.

However, we should also initialize the loop variable `i` to 0, as this is the starting point for the loop. The other variables (`curr_x`, `curr_y`, `turn`, and `store`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial state.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`rows` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ rows ≤ 300, `cols` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ cols ≤ 300, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ 2k ≤ rows * cols, `curr_x` is 0, `curr_y` is 0, `turn` is 0, `store` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
