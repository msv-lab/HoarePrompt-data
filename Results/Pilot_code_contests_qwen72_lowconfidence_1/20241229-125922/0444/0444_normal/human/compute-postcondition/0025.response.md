The code snippet `before = [a, b]` updates the `before` list to contain the values of `a` and `b`, which are the next tuple in the `pairs` list.

- `before` is now `[a, b]`.
- The values of `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, which means `a` and `b` are the next `l_i` and `r_i` from the `pairs` list, respectively.
- All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `x`, `m`, `pairs`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, `before` is `[a, b]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`**.
