Output State: **The program returns `ans`, which is the sum of all increments based on the conditions in the loop. The initial value of `ans` is 0, and it gets incremented within the loop based on specific conditions. The exact value of `ans` depends on the contents of `arr` and the values of `n`, `x`, and `m`.**
