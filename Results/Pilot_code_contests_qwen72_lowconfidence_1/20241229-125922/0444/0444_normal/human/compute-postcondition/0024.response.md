The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the difference between `b` and `before[1]` to its current value. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, `before` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body, `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`**
