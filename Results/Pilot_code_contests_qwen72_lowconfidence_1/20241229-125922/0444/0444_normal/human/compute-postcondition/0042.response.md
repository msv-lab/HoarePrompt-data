The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `arr`, `n`, `x`, and `m`. 

- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are `0`.
- `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`.
- The function also receives `m` pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n` for each pair.

The function returns `ans`, which is the sum of all increments based on the conditions in the loop. The initial value of `ans` is `0`, and it gets incremented within the loop based on specific conditions. The exact value of `ans` depends on the contents of `arr` and the values of `n`, `x`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of `n` integers with `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements `0`, and three positive integers `n`, `x`, and `m` (where `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`). It also receives `m` pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (where `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`). The function returns `ans`, which is the sum of all increments based on the conditions in the loop, starting from an initial value of `0`.**
