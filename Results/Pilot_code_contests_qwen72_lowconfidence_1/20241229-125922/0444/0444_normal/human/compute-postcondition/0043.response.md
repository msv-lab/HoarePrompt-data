Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are `0`, and three positive integers `n`, `x`, and `m` (where `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`). It also receives `m` pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (where `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`). The function processes these pairs to calculate and return an integer `ans`, which represents the sum of increments based on the following conditions within the loop:

1. If the current interval `[a, b]` overlaps with the current `before` interval at the start, `ans` is incremented by the difference between the start of `before` and the start of the new interval, and `before` is updated to start from `a`.
2. If the current interval `[a, b]` overlaps with the current `before` interval at the end, `ans` is incremented by the difference between the end of the new interval and the end of `before`, and `before` is updated to end at `b`.
3. If the current interval `[a, b]` completely encompasses the current `before` interval, `ans` is incremented by the differences at both the start and end of the intervals, and `before` is updated to the new interval `[a, b]`.

If none of the conditions are met, `before` remains unchanged. The function returns the final value of `ans`, which starts at `1` and is incremented based on the above conditions. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the calculated sum, and `before` holds the last valid interval that satisfied any of the conditions in the loop, or remains `[x, x]` if no conditions were met. **

Note: The initial value of `ans` is `1`, not `0` as mentioned in the annotations. This is a discrepancy between the code and the annotations.
