The code snippet assigns the current values of `a` and `b` to the list `before`. The initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, and `before` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `before` is updated to `[a, b]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`, `before` is now `[a, b]`.**
