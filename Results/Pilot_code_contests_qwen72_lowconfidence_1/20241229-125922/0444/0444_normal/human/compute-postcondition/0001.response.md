The code snippet `before = [x, x]` creates a new list named `before` and initializes it with two elements, both set to the value of `x`.

- `arr` remains a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are `0`.
- `n`, `x`, and `m` remain positive integers with their original constraints.
- The pairs `(l_i, r_i)` remain as they were.
- `ans` remains `1`.
- `before` is now a list with two elements, both equal to `x`.

Output State: **arr is a list of n integers where arr[x-1] = 1 and all other elements are 0; n, x, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100; the function also receives m pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n for each pair; ans = 1; before = [x, x]**
