The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `b - before[1]` to its current value. Let's break down the changes and their impacts:

- The initial value of `ans` is `1 + (x - a)`.
- The code `ans += b - before[1]` modifies `ans` by adding the difference between `b` and `before[1]` to the current value of `ans`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` becomes:
\[ \text{ans} = (1 + (x - a)) + (b - \text{before}[1]) \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ \text{ans} = 1 + x - a + b - \text{before}[1] \]

All other variables (`arr`, `pairs`, `n`, `x`, `m`, `before`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `ans` is `1 + x - a + b - before[1]`, `before = [x, x]`, it is not true that `(a <= before[0] and before[0] <= b <= before[1])`, it is not true that `(before[0] <= a <= before[1] and b >= before[1])`, and the current values of `a` and `b` satisfy the condition `(a <= before[0] and b >= before[1])`.**
