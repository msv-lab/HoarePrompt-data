The code updates the `before` list to `[before[0], b]`. This means that the first element of `before` remains unchanged, while the second element is updated to the current value of `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`, `before` is now `[before[0], b]`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list, `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`, `before` is now `[before[0], b]`**
