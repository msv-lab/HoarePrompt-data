Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list. If `before[0] <= a <= before[1]` and `b >= before[1]`, `before` is updated to `[before[0], b]` and `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])`. Otherwise, `before` remains unchanged.***
