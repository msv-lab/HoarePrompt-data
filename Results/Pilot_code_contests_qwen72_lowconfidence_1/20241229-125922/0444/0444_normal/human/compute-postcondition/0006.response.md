Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `ans = 1`, `before = [x, x]`, and it is not true that `(a <= before[0] and before[0] <= b <= before[1])`**
