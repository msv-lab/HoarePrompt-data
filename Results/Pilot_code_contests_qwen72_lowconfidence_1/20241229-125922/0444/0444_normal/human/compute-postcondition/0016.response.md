Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`. If `before[0] <= a <= before[1]` and `b >= before[1]`, then `ans` is updated to `1 + (b - x)`, and `before` is updated to `[x, b]`. Otherwise, if `a <= before[0]` and `b >= before[1]`, then `ans` is updated to `1 + x - a + b - before[1]`, and `before` is updated to `[a, b]`. In all other cases, `ans` remains 1, and `before` remains `[x, x]`. It remains true that it is not the case that `(a <= before[0] and before[0] <= b <= before[1])` and it is not the case that `(before[0] <= a <= before[1] and b >= before[1])`.***
