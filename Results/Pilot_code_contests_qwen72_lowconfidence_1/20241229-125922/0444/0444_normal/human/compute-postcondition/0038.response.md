Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `pairs` is a list of `m` tuples `(l_i, r_i)` such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `a` and `b` are the next tuple in the `pairs` list. If `before[0] <= a <= before[1]` and `b >= before[1]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])` and `before` is updated to `[before[0], b]`. Otherwise, if `a <= before[0]` and `b >= before[1]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (b - before[1])` and `before` is updated to `[a, b]`. In all other cases, `before` remains unchanged.***
