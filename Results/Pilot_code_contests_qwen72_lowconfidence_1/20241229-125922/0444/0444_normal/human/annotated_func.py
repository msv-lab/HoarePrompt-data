#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers where arr[x-1] = 1 and all other elements are 0; n, x, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100; the function also receives m pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n for each pair.
def func_1(arr, n, x, m):
    ans = 1
    before = [x, x]
    for (a, b) in arr:
        if a <= before[0] and before[0] <= b <= before[1]:
            ans += before[0] - a
            before = [a, before[1]]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are 0, `n`, `x`, and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `ans` is the sum of all increments based on the conditions in the loop, `before` is the last valid interval `[a, b]` that satisfies any of the conditions in the loop. If no conditions are met, `before` remains `[x, x]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the sum of all increments based on the conditions in the loop. The initial value of `ans` is 0, and it gets incremented within the loop based on specific conditions. The exact value of `ans` depends on the contents of `arr` and the values of `n`, `x`, and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of `n` integers where `arr[x-1] = 1` and all other elements are `0`, and three positive integers `n`, `x`, and `m` (where `1 ≤ x ≤ n` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`). It also receives `m` pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (where `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`). The function processes these pairs to calculate and return an integer `ans`, which represents the sum of increments based on the following conditions within the loop:

1. If the current interval `[a, b]` overlaps with the current `before` interval at the start, `ans` is incremented by the difference between the start of `before` and the start of the new interval, and `before` is updated to start from `a`.
2. If the current interval `[a, b]` overlaps with the current `before` interval at the end, `ans` is incremented by the difference between the end of the new interval and the end of `before`, and `before` is updated to end at `b`.
3. If the current interval `[a, b]` completely encompasses the current `before` interval, `ans` is incremented by the differences at both the start and end of the intervals, and `before` is updated to the new interval `[a, b]`.

If none of the conditions are met, `before` remains unchanged. The function returns the final value of `ans`, which starts at `1` and is incremented based on the above conditions. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds the calculated sum, and `before` holds the last valid interval that satisfied any of the conditions in the loop, or remains `[x, x]` if no conditions were met.
