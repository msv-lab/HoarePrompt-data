### Analysis of the Program

The program aims to solve the problem described, which involves determining the number of indices \( k \) such that it is possible to place the value 1 at index \( k \) after performing a series of swap operations on an array.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Initial State**: An array \( a \) of length \( n \) where \( a_x = 1 \) and all other elements are 0.
- **Operations**: Perform \( m \) operations where each operation swaps elements within a specified range \([l_i, r_i]\).
- **Goal**: Determine the number of indices \( k \) such that it is possible to place the value 1 at index \( k \) after all operations.

### Program Structure
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( m \).
   - It then reads \( m \) pairs of integers \((l_i, r_i)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to 1 and `before` to \([x, x]\).
   - It iterates through each operation \((a, b)\):
     - If \( a \leq \text{before}[0] \leq b \leq \text{before}[1] \), it updates `ans` and `before`.
     - If \( \text{before}[0] \leq a \leq \text{before}[1] \leq b \), it updates `ans` and `before`.
     - If \( a \leq \text{before}[0] \) and \( b \geq \text{before}[1] \), it updates `ans` and `before`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - The initial state of `before` as \([x, x]\) correctly represents the initial position of the 1 in the array.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through each operation and updates the possible range of indices where the 1 can be placed.
   - The conditions inside the loop ensure that the range is expanded correctly based on the current operation's range \([a, b]\).

3. **Range Expansion**:
   - The logic for expanding the range is correct:
     - If the current range \([a, b]\) intersects with the existing range \(\text{before}\), it updates the range accordingly.
     - The `ans` variable is incremented correctly to account for the new possible positions of the 1.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of possible indices \( k \) where the 1 can be placed, which matches the problem's requirement.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It accurately determines the number of indices \( k \) where the 1 can be placed after performing the specified operations.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
