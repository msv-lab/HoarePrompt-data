Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Initial State of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, but it should be initialized to 0. The problem requires calculating the number of indices `k` such that it is possible to have `a_k = 1` after performing the operations. The initial value of `ans` should be 0, and it should be incremented based on the conditions in the loop.

2. **Interval Handling**: The logic for updating the interval `before` and incrementing `ans` is not entirely correct. Specifically:
   - The program should track the range of indices where the value 1 can potentially be moved to after each operation.
   - The variable `before` should represent the range `[left, right]` where the value 1 can be moved.
   - The program should correctly update this range and count the number of indices within this range.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final value of `ans` should be the length of the range `[left, right]` where the value 1 can be moved. The current implementation does not correctly compute this length.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
FAST_IO = 1
if FAST_IO:
    import io, sys, atexit
    rr = iter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines()).next
    sys.stdout = _OUTPUT_BUFFER = io.BytesIO()

    @atexit.register
    def write():
        sys.__stdout__.write(_OUTPUT_BUFFER.getvalue())
else:
    rr = raw_input
rri = lambda : int(rr())
rrm = lambda : map(int, rr().split())
t = rri()
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, m) = rrm()
    arr = []
    for _ in range(m):
        arr.append(rrm())
    print(func_1(arr, n, x, m))

def func_1(arr, n, x, m):
    left, right = x, x
    for (a, b) in arr:
        if a <= left and b >= right:
            left, right = a, b
        elif a <= left <= b:
            left = a
        elif a <= right <= b:
            right = b
    return right - left + 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Implementation
- **Initialization**: `left` and `right` are initialized to `x`, representing the initial position of the value 1.
- **Loop**: For each operation `(a, b)`, the function updates the range `[left, right]`:
  - If the current interval `[a, b]` completely encompasses the current range `[left, right]`, update `left` and `right` to `[a, b]`.
  - If the current interval overlaps with the start of the current range, update `left` to `a`.
  - If the current interval overlaps with the end of the current range, update `right` to `b`.
- **Final Calculation**: The function returns the length of the range `[left, right]`, which is `right - left + 1`.

This corrected implementation ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of indices `k` where `a_k = 1` after performing the operations, as required by the problem description.
