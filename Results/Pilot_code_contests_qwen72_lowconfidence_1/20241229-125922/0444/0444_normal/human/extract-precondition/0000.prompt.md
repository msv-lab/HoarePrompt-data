You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given an array consisting of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Initially a_x = 1, all other elements are equal to 0.

You have to perform m operations. During the i-th operation, you choose two indices c and d such that l_i ≤ c, d ≤ r_i, and swap a_c and a_d.

Calculate the number of indices k such that it is possible to choose the operations so that a_k = 1 in the end.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then the description of t testcases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ m ≤ 100; 1 ≤ x ≤ n).

Each of next m lines contains the descriptions of the operations; the i-th line contains two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).

Output

For each test case print one integer — the number of indices k such that it is possible to choose the operations so that a_k = 1 in the end.

3 3 2

Output

Note

In the first test case, it is possible to achieve a_k = 1 for every k. To do so, you may use the following operations:

  1. swap a_k and a_4; 
  2. swap a_2 and a_2; 
  3. swap a_5 and a_5. 



In the second test case, only k = 1 and k = 2 are possible answers. To achieve a_1 = 1, you have to swap a_1 and a_1 during the second operation. To achieve a_2 = 1, you have to swap a_1 and a_2 during the second operation.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(arr, n, x, m):
```
