The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns 0 if `x` is 0 or if `x` is a positive integer that is not a power of 2. If `x` is a positive integer and a power of 2, the function returns `x`. This means that for any input `x`, the function will either return 0 (if `x` is 0 or not a power of 2) or return the value of `x` itself (if `x` is a power of 2).
