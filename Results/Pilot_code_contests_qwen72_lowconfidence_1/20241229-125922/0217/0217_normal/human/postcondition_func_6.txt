The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. It returns a sorted list of these integers based on the key function `getKey`. The sorting is performed using the `sorted` function with `getKey` as the key function, which means the final order of the elements in the returned list depends on the implementation of `getKey`. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and works correctly for the elements in `l`. If `getKey` is not defined or does not work as expected, the function may not return the intended sorted list. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list `l` and only returns a new sorted list.
