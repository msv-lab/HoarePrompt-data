The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns the input provided by the user as a string. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input, non-string input, or input that exceeds the buffer size. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned string, which is the exact input provided by the user.
