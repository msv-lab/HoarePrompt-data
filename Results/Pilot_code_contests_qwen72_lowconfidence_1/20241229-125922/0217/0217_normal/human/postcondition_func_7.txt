The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list (matrix), and `num` is an integer. The function returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element in the matrix is the integer `num`. If either `n` or `m` is zero, the function returns an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively.
