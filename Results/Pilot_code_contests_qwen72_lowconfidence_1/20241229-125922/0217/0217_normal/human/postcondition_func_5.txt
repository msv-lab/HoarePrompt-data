The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list with at least one element. It returns the first element of `item`. If `item` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not modify the input `item` and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will receive the first element of `item`, and the state of `item` remains unchanged.
