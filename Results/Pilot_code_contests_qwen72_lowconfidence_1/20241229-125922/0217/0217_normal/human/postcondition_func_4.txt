The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then starts a new thread that runs the `main` function. After `func_5` concludes, the recursion limit and stack size are set to the specified values, and a new thread is running the `main` function. If the `main` function is not defined or if there are issues with threading (e.g., resource limits, system configuration), the behavior of the function could be unpredictable or result in errors.
