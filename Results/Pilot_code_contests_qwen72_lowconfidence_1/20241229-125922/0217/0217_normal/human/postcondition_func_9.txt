The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. It returns the binary representation of `n` as a string, without the '0b' prefix. The function does not validate the input to ensure it meets the specified constraints (even integer and within the range), so it will still attempt to convert any integer input to its binary representation, regardless of whether it meets these conditions. If the input is outside the specified range or is not an even integer, the function will still execute and return the binary representation, but this might not be the intended behavior.
