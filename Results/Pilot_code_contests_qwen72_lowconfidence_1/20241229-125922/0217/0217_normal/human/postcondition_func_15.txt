The function `func_16` accepts a tuple of values `args`, a separator byte string `sep`, a writable file-like object `file`, an ending byte string `end`, and a boolean `flush`. It writes the formatted content to the specified file-like object, using `sep` to separate the arguments and appending `end` after the last argument. If `flush` is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. The function does not return any value. 

- If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`, and only `end` is appended.
- If `sep` is not provided, it defaults to `b' '`.
- If `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- If `end` is not provided, it defaults to `b'\n'`.
- If `flush` is `True`, the stream is flushed after writing the content. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where `file` is not writable or is closed.
- The function does not validate the types of `sep`, `end`, or `flush`.
- The function assumes that `str(x)` conversion is valid for all elements in `args`.
- The function does not handle exceptions that may occur during file operations (e.g., `write` or `flush`).
- The function does not restore `kwargs` to its original state after popping keys.
