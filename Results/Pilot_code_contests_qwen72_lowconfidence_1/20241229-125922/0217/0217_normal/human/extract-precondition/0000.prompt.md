You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. 

Your goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type: 

  * take two indices i and j such that 2 ⋅ |i - j| ≥ n and swap p_i and p_j. 



There is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than 5 ⋅ n operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation. 

The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the given permutation.

Output

On the first line print m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ n) — the number of swaps to perform.

Each of the following m lines should contain integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, |a_i - b_i| ≥ n/2) — the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.

Note that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.

Examples

Input


2
2 1


Output


1
1 2

Input


4
3 4 1 2


Output


4
1 4
1 4
1 3
2 4


Input


6
2 5 3 1 4 6


Output


3
1 5
2 5
1 4

Note

In the first example, when one swap elements on positions 1 and 2, the array becomes sorted.

In the second example, pay attention that there is no need to minimize number of swaps.

In the third example, after swapping elements on positions 1 and 5 the array becomes: [4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6]. After swapping elements on positions 2 and 5 the array becomes [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] and finally after swapping elements on positions 1 and 4 the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Program:
```
def func_16(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
