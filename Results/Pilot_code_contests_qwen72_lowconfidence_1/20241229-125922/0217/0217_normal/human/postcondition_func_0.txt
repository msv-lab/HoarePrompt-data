The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value (if the input was valid), and the state of the program will depend on how this returned value is used in the calling context.
