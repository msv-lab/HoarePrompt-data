The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError` being raised during the conversion process. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object is returned, which can be iterated over to access the integers.
