You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. 

Your goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type: 

  * take two indices i and j such that 2 ⋅ |i - j| ≥ n and swap p_i and p_j. 



There is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than 5 ⋅ n operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation. 

The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the given permutation.

Output

On the first line print m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ n) — the number of swaps to perform.

Each of the following m lines should contain integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, |a_i - b_i| ≥ n/2) — the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.

Note that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.

Examples

Input


2
2 1


Output


1
1 2

Input


4
3 4 1 2


Output


4
1 4
1 4
1 3
2 4


Input


6
2 5 3 1 4 6


Output


3
1 5
2 5
1 4

Note

In the first example, when one swap elements on positions 1 and 2, the array becomes sorted.

In the second example, pay attention that there is no need to minimize number of swaps.

In the third example, after swapping elements on positions 1 and 5 the array becomes: [4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6]. After swapping elements on positions 2 and 5 the array becomes [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] and finally after swapping elements on positions 1 and 4 the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
