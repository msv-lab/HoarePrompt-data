Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the length of the permutation `n` and the permutation itself `l` from the standard input. This matches the problem's input format.

2. **Dictionary Creation**:
   - A dictionary `d` is created to map each element in the permutation to its index. This helps in efficiently finding the index of any element during the sorting process.

3. **Sorting Process**:
   - The program creates a sorted version of the permutation `a` to compare with the original permutation `l`.
   - For each element in the permutation, if the element is not already in its correct position, the program performs swaps according to the rules specified in the problem:
     - If the distance between the current position and the target position is greater than or equal to `n // 2`, it directly swaps the elements.
     - If the distance is less than `n // 2`, it performs additional swaps to ensure the condition `2 * |i - j| ≥ n` is met. This involves swapping with either the first or the last element to achieve the required distance.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of swaps performed and the details of each swap, which matches the output format specified in the problem.

5. **Correctness of Swaps**:
   - The program ensures that each swap operation meets the condition `2 * |i - j| ≥ n`, and it performs no more than `5 * n` swaps, as required by the problem constraints.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as small permutations (e.g., `n = 2`) and larger permutations (up to `3 * 10^5`) correctly. It also ensures that the permutation is sorted using the allowed operations.

Given the above points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
