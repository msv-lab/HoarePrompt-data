Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The function `func_15` appears to correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` using `func_1` and `func_4`. This aligns with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Dictionary Creation**:
   - A dictionary `d` is created to map each integer in the list `l` to its index. This helps in quickly finding the index of any element in the list.

3. **Sorting and Swapping**:
   - The function creates a sorted copy of the list `a` and initializes an empty list `ans` to store the swap operations.
   - For each element in the list `l`, if it is already in its correct position in the sorted list `a`, it continues to the next element.
   - If an element is not in its correct position, the function checks if the distance between the current index and the target index is at least `n // 2`. If so, it performs the swap directly.
   - If the distance is less than `n // 2`, the function performs additional swaps to ensure the distance condition is met before making the final swap to place the element in its correct position.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of swaps and the details of each swap using `func_16`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as small values of `n` (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 4`) and larger values within the specified range.
   - The function ensures that the number of swaps does not exceed `5 * n`, as required by the problem statement.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly sorts the permutation using the allowed operations and ensures that the number of operations is within the limit.
   - The function correctly handles all potential cases, including permutations that are already sorted, permutations that require multiple swaps, and permutations with large `n`.

Given the above points, the function `func_15` meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
