Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_12` contains a typo that would prevent it from functioning correctly. The line `x = x * x % p1` should be `x = x * x % p`, but due to the typo, the function will raise a `NameError` because `p1` is not defined. This error would propagate and affect the overall correctness of the program.

Additionally, the function `func_16` does not properly handle keyword arguments. The function signature does not match the usage in the code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The function should be defined to accept `*args` and `**kwargs` to properly handle the arguments and keyword arguments.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
