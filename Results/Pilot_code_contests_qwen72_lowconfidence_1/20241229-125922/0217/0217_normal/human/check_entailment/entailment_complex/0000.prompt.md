You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. 

Your goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type: 

  * take two indices i and j such that 2 ⋅ |i - j| ≥ n and swap p_i and p_j. 



There is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than 5 ⋅ n operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation. 

The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the given permutation.

Output

On the first line print m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ n) — the number of swaps to perform.

Each of the following m lines should contain integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, |a_i - b_i| ≥ n/2) — the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.

Note that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note

In the first example, when one swap elements on positions 1 and 2, the array becomes sorted.

In the second example, pay attention that there is no need to minimize number of swaps.

In the third example, after swapping elements on positions 1 and 5 the array becomes: [4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6]. After swapping elements on positions 2 and 5 the array becomes [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] and finally after swapping elements on positions 1 and 4 the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, the function will raise a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value (if the input was valid), and the state of the program will depend on how this returned value is used in the calling context.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input without specifying the expected format or content.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user through the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns the input provided by the user as a string. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input, non-string input, or input that exceeds the buffer size. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned string, which is the exact input provided by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters. It reads input from stdin, expecting a line of space-separated integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers from the input line, which was a line of space-separated integers read from stdin.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), expecting the line to contain space-separated integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input line is empty or contains non-integer values, the behavior is undefined and may result in a `ValueError` being raised during the conversion process. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a map object is returned, which can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not have any input parameters.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by calling `func_3()`. Since there is no information about `func_3()`, the specific elements of the list cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling another function `func_3()`. The specific elements of the list cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` returns a non-iterable or raises an exception, `func_4` will also raise an exception.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, thus there are no preconditions related to input variables.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then starts a new thread that runs the `main` function. After `func_5` concludes, the recursion limit and stack size are set to the specified values, and a new thread is running the `main` function. If the `main` function is not defined or if there are issues with threading (e.g., resource limits, system configuration), the behavior of the function could be unpredictable or result in errors.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list with at least one element.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the tuple or list 'item'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list with at least one element. It returns the first element of `item`. If `item` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not modify the input `item` and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will receive the first element of `item`, and the state of `item` remains unchanged.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is an even number.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. The sorting is based on the key function `getKey`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. It returns a sorted list of these integers based on the key function `getKey`. The sorting is performed using the `sorted` function with `getKey` as the key function, which means the final order of the elements in the returned list depends on the implementation of `getKey`. The function assumes that `getKey` is defined elsewhere and works correctly for the elements in `l`. If `getKey` is not defined or does not work as expected, the function may not return the intended sorted list. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list `l` and only returns a new sorted list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers, and num is an integer.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list (matrix) with dimensions n x m, where each element in the matrix is the integer 'num'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. Here, `n` and `m` are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list (matrix), and `num` is an integer. The function returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element in the matrix is the integer `num`. If either `n` or `m` is zero, the function returns an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns 0 if `x` is 0 or any positive integer that is not a power of 2, and returns `x` if `x` is a power of 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a non-negative integer `x`. It returns 0 if `x` is 0 or if `x` is a positive integer that is not a power of 2. If `x` is a positive integer and a power of 2, the function returns `x`. This means that for any input `x`, the function will either return 0 (if `x` is 0 or not a power of 2) or return the value of `x` itself (if `x` is a power of 2).

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of n as a string, without the '0b' prefix, where n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. It returns the binary representation of `n` as a string, without the '0b' prefix. The function does not validate the input to ensure it meets the specified constraints (even integer and within the range), so it will still attempt to convert any integer input to its binary representation, regardless of whether it meets these conditions. If the input is outside the specified range or is not an even integer, the function will still execute and return the binary representation, but this might not be the intended behavior.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. The function handles positive integers correctly, but it does not handle negative integers or zero as special cases. For negative integers, the minus sign is included in the string representation, which could lead to an incorrect result (e.g., `func_11(-123)` would return `['-', 1, 2, 3]`, which is not valid). For zero, the function returns `[0]`, which is correct.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, p is a positive integer greater than 1.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is \( x^{\text{original } y} \mod p \), `x` is the last computed power of `x` modulo `p`, `p` is a positive integer greater than 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the value of `res`, which is \( x^{\text{original } y} \mod p \), where `x` is the last computed power of `x` modulo `p`, `y` is 0, and `p` is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer), `y` (a non-negative integer), and `p` (a positive integer greater than 1). It computes and returns the value of \( x^y \mod p \). After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `y` is 0, `res` holds the value \( x^{\text{original } y} \mod p \), and `x` is the last computed power of `x` modulo `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1 as expected. However, there is a typo in the code (`p1` instead of `p`), which should be corrected to ensure the function works as intended.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the initial value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the variable `y` is 0, and `x` holds the GCD of the initial values of `x` and `y`. The function correctly handles the case where either or both of the input parameters are 0, returning the non-zero value or 0 if both are 0.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, and `n` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is the smallest integer such that \( i \times i > n \), `n` remains unchanged from its original value (an integer greater than 3, not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3), and for all integers \( k \) where \( 5 \leq k < i \) and \( k \equiv 5 \pmod{6} \) or \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), `n % k != 0` and `n % (k + 2) != 0`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` determines whether an integer `n` greater than 1 is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Specifically:

- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `True`.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `False`.
- For integers greater than 3, the function checks divisibility by all integers of the form `6k ± 1` up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Potential Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 2 or 3, which are the smallest prime numbers.
- The function correctly handles non-prime numbers like 4, 6, 8, etc., which are divisible by 2 or 3.
- The function correctly handles larger composite numbers that are not divisible by 2 or 3 but are divisible by other primes.
- The function correctly handles large prime numbers by checking divisibility up to the square root of `n`.

Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is an integer greater than 1, but it does not explicitly check for non-integer inputs or negative integers. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not an integer greater than 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It internally generates an even integer `n` within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing a permutation. The function then sorts the list `l` by performing a series of swaps and records these swaps in a list `ans`. Each swap is represented as a pair of indices, and the function calls `func_16` with the length of `ans` and then with each pair of indices in `ans`. After the function concludes, `l` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, and `func_16` has been called with the number of swaps and the details of each swap. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the side effects include the modification of `l` and the calls to `func_16`.

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout` (and its buffer may have been flushed if `flush` was `True`), `end` has been written to `file`, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` if it was present.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts a tuple of values `args`, a separator byte string `sep`, a writable file-like object `file`, an ending byte string `end`, and a boolean `flush`. It writes the formatted content to the specified file-like object, using `sep` to separate the arguments and appending `end` after the last argument. If `flush` is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. The function does not return any value. 

- If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`, and only `end` is appended.
- If `sep` is not provided, it defaults to `b' '`.
- If `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- If `end` is not provided, it defaults to `b'\n'`.
- If `flush` is `True`, the stream is flushed after writing the content. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where `file` is not writable or is closed.
- The function does not validate the types of `sep`, `end`, or `flush`.
- The function assumes that `str(x)` conversion is valid for all elements in `args`.
- The function does not handle exceptions that may occur during file operations (e.g., `write` or `flush`).
- The function does not restore `kwargs` to its original state after popping keys.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
