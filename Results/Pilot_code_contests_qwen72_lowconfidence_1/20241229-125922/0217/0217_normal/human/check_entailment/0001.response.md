Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an even-length permutation of integers, sorts it using the allowed swap operations, and outputs the sequence of swaps performed. The program ensures that the indices used for swapping satisfy the condition \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\), which aligns with the problem's constraints. Additionally, the program limits the number of operations to no more than \(5 \cdot n\), as required. After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not identify any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
