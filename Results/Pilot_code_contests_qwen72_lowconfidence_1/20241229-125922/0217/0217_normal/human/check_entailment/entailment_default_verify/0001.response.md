Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the logic required to sort the permutation using the allowed swap operations, ensuring that the indices used for swapping satisfy the condition \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\). The program also limits the number of operations to no more than \(5 \cdot n\), as required by the problem constraints.

The output hints for `func_16` provide additional details about the function's behavior, but these details do not affect the correctness of the main logic implemented in `func_15`. The potential edge cases and missing functionality mentioned in the output hints (e.g., handling non-writable files, validating types, etc.) are not relevant to the problem's constraints, as the problem assumes valid input and does not require robust error handling for file operations.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness of the program.
