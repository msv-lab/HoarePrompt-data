You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. 

Your goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type: 

  * take two indices i and j such that 2 ⋅ |i - j| ≥ n and swap p_i and p_j. 



There is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than 5 ⋅ n operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation. 

The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the given permutation.

Output

On the first line print m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ n) — the number of swaps to perform.

Each of the following m lines should contain integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, |a_i - b_i| ≥ n/2) — the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.

Note that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.

Examples

1 4
1 3
2 4


Input


6
2 5 3 1 4 6


Output


3
1 5
2 5
1 4

Note

In the first example, when one swap elements on positions 1 and 2, the array becomes sorted.

In the second example, pay attention that there is no need to minimize number of swaps.

In the third example, after swapping elements on positions 1 and 5 the array becomes: [4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6]. After swapping elements on positions 2 and 5 the array becomes [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] and finally after swapping elements on positions 1 and 4 the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an even-length permutation of integers, sorts it using the allowed swap operations, and outputs the sequence of swaps performed. The program ensures that the indices used for swapping satisfy the condition \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\), which aligns with the problem's constraints. Additionally, the program limits the number of operations to no more than \(5 \cdot n\), as required. After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I could not identify any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 16 : The function `func_16` accepts a tuple of values `args`, a separator byte string `sep`, a writable file-like object `file`, an ending byte string `end`, and a boolean `flush`. It writes the formatted content to the specified file-like object, using `sep` to separate the arguments and appending `end` after the last argument. If `flush` is `True`, the stream is forcibly flushed. The function does not return any value. 

- If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`, and only `end` is appended.
- If `sep` is not provided, it defaults to `b' '`.
- If `file` is not provided, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- If `end` is not provided, it defaults to `b'\n'`.
- If `flush` is `True`, the stream is flushed after writing the content. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where `file` is not writable or is closed.
- The function does not validate the types of `sep`, `end`, or `flush`.
- The function assumes that `str(x)` conversion is valid for all elements in `args`.
- The function does not handle exceptions that may occur during file operations (e.g., `write` or `flush`).
- The function does not restore `kwargs` to its original state after popping keys.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
