You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where n is an even number. 

Your goal is to sort the permutation. To do so, you can perform zero or more operations of the following type: 

  * take two indices i and j such that 2 ⋅ |i - j| ≥ n and swap p_i and p_j. 



There is no need to minimize the number of operations, however you should use no more than 5 ⋅ n operations. One can show that it is always possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, n is even) — the length of the permutation. 

The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, …, p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) — the given permutation.

Output

On the first line print m (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ n) — the number of swaps to perform.

Each of the following m lines should contain integers a_i, b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, |a_i - b_i| ≥ n/2) — the indices that should be swapped in the corresponding swap.

Note that there is no need to minimize the number of operations. We can show that an answer always exists.

Examples

Input


2
2 1


Output


1
1 2

Input


4
3 4 1 2


Output


4
1 4
1 4
1 3
2 4


Input


6
2 5 3 1 4 6


Output


3
1 5
2 5
1 4

Note

In the first example, when one swap elements on positions 1 and 2, the array becomes sorted.

In the second example, pay attention that there is no need to minimize number of swaps.

In the third example, after swapping elements on positions 1 and 5 the array becomes: [4, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6]. After swapping elements on positions 2 and 5 the array becomes [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6] and finally after swapping elements on positions 1 and 4 the array becomes sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
