Final: **True**

Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values. `func_1()` reads the integer `n`, and `func_4()` reads the permutation list `l`. These functions are used appropriately in `func_15()` to initialize the necessary variables.

2. **Dictionary Creation**: The program creates a dictionary `d` to map each element in the permutation to its index. This is crucial for efficiently finding the indices needed for swapping.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the permutation by repeatedly swapping elements that are far enough apart (i.e., \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\)). The logic ensures that the swaps are performed in a way that eventually sorts the permutation. The conditions and loops are structured to handle the swaps correctly.

4. **Swap Operations**: The program ensures that the swaps are performed only when the distance between the indices is at least \(n/2\). This aligns with the problem's requirement that \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\).

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps performed. The function `func_16()` is used to print the results, and it handles the formatting and writing to the output stream as expected.

6. **Annotations**: The annotations provide a clear and consistent state of the program at different points, confirming that the program follows the intended logic and maintains the required conditions throughout its execution.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the smallest valid input (n=2) and larger inputs up to the specified limit. The logic ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot n\), as required by the problem statement.

Given the above points, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
