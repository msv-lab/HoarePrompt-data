Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the permutation is already sorted. According to the problem description, if the permutation is already sorted, the program should output `0` swaps. However, the current implementation will still attempt to perform swaps, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this specific case. This means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
