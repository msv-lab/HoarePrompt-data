Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program provided in `func_15` appears to correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key points to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` using `func_1` and `func_4`. This ensures the input is valid and matches the problem description.

2. **Dictionary Creation**:
   - A dictionary `d` is created to map each element in the permutation to its index. This allows for efficient lookups when determining the indices to swap.

3. **Sorting and Swapping**:
   - The function creates a sorted copy of the permutation `a` and iterates through it to determine the necessary swaps.
   - For each element in the sorted list that is not in its correct position in the original list, the function checks if the distance between the current position and the target position is at least `n // 2`.
   - If the condition is met, it performs the swap directly.
   - If the condition is not met, it performs additional swaps to ensure the elements are moved correctly. These additional swaps involve moving elements to the ends of the list and then back to their correct positions, ensuring the swap condition is always met.

4. **Output**:
   - The function records the swaps in the list `ans` and calls `func_16` to print the number of swaps and the details of each swap.

The function correctly ensures that the number of swaps is no more than `5 * n` and that each swap meets the condition \(2 \cdot |i - j| \geq n\). The provided code and output hints align with the problem description and cover all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
