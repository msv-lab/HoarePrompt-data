The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x` (a non-negative integer), `y` (a non-negative integer), and `p` (a positive integer greater than 1). It computes and returns the value of \( x^y \mod p \). After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows: `y` is 0, `res` holds the value \( x^{\text{original } y} \mod p \), and `x` is the last computed power of `x` modulo `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1 as expected. However, there is a typo in the code (`p1` instead of `p`), which should be corrected to ensure the function works as intended.
