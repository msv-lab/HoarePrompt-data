The function `func_11` accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of integers, where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. The function handles positive integers correctly, but it does not handle negative integers or zero as special cases. For negative integers, the minus sign is included in the string representation, which could lead to an incorrect result (e.g., `func_11(-123)` would return `['-', 1, 2, 3]`, which is not valid). For zero, the function returns `[0]`, which is correct.
