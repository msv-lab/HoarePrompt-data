The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It internally generates an even integer `n` within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing a permutation. The function then sorts the list `l` by performing a series of swaps and records these swaps in a list `ans`. Each swap is represented as a pair of indices, and the function calls `func_16` with the length of `ans` and then with each pair of indices in `ans`. After the function concludes, `l` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, and `func_16` has been called with the number of swaps and the details of each swap. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the side effects include the modification of `l` and the calls to `func_16`.
