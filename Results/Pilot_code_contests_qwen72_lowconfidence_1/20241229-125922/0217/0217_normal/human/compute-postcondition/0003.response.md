To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the elements in the `args` tuple. Therefore, the loop will execute if `args` contains at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `end` is a byte string appended after the last argument.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is `True`.

For the loop to execute:
- `args` must contain at least one element.

The other variables (`sep`, `file`, `end`, `flush`, `at_start`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they should be mentioned as part of the initial state.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type that must contain at least one element, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a byte string appended after the last argument, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is `True`**
