Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l` (updated if necessary), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `x` is either `d[3]` or `d[1]` (depending on the condition), `y` is 2, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`). If `abs(d[a[i]] - i) >= n // 2`, `ans` contains either `[[1, 1], [d[3] + 1, 3]]` or `[[x + 1, y + 1], [d[2] + 1, 2], [d[3] + 1, 3]]`. Otherwise, if `d[a[i]] - i <= n // 2`, `ans` contains either `[[1, 1], [x + 1, y + 1], [x + 1, y + 1]]` or `[[x + 1, y + 1], [d[2] + 1, 2], [x + 1, y + 1], [x + 1, y + 1]]`.***
