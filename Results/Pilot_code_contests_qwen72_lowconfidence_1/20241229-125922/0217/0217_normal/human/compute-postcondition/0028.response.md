Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is the index of 1 in `l`, the absolute difference between `x` and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `x` is less than `n // 2`, `y` is set to `n - 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `n // 2`, `y` is set to 0.***
