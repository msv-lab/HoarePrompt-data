The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. Internally, it expects `n` to be an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `l` to be a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing a permutation. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot accurately describe the return value without additional context.

However, based on the given internal expectations, a typical functionality might involve some operation on the permutation list `l` and the integer `n`. For the purpose of this description, I will assume the function performs some operation (such as sorting, rearranging, or analyzing the permutation) and returns a result based on that operation.
