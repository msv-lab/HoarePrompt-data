Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]`, `i` is 0, `x` is `d[1]` (which is either `n - 1` or `0`), the absolute difference between `x` and `i` is less than `n // 2`, the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`. If `x` is less than `n // 2`, `y` is set to `n - 1`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to `n // 2`, `y` is set to 0.***
