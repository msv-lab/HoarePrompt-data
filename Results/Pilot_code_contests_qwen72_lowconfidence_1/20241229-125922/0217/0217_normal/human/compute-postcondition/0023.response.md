Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout` (and its buffer may have been flushed if `flush` was `True`), `end` has been written to `file`, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` if it was present.***
