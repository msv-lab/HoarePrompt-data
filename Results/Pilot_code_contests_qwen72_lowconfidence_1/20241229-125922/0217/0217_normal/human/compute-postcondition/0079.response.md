The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `x` is `d[3]`, `y` is `n - 1`, `ans` contains either [[1, 1]] or `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[d[2] + 1, 2]`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`).**
