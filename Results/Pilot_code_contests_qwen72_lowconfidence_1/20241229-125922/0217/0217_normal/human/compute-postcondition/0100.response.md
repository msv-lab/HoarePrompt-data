According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `ans`. If there are more elements in `ans`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_16(*i)` was called, indicating that `i` was an element from `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `ans` to be assigned to `i`.

State: **`func_16(*i)` was called, `i` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must have at least one more element**
