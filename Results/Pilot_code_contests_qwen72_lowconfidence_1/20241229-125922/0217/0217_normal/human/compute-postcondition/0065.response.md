Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in their original positions, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 1, `x` is `d[2]`, `y` is `n - 1` if `x < n // 2`, otherwise `y` is 0, `ans` contains `[x + 1, y + 1]` and possibly another `[x + 1, y + 1]` based on the initial conditions. If `d[a[i]] - i <= n // 2`, then one more `[x + 1, y + 1]` is appended to `ans`.***
