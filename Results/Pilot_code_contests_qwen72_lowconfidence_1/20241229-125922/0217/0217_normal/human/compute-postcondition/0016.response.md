Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of values of any type that must contain at least one element, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` is a byte string appended after the last argument, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is `False`, and the next element in `args` will be the new `x`. If `at_start` is `False`, the value of `sep` has been written to `file`.***
