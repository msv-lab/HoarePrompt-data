The provided code snippet is a function call `func_16(*i)`. Without the definition of `func_16` or the value of `i`, it's impossible to determine the exact changes to the state. However, the call itself implies that `func_16` is being invoked with the elements of `i` unpacked as arguments. Since no return value or side effects (such as changes to global variables or the state of objects passed by reference) are specified, the only thing we can conclude is that `func_16` was called.

Output State: **`func_16(*i)` was called**.
