Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]`, `i` is 0, `x` is the index of 1 in `l`, the absolute difference between `x` and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `x < n // 2`, `y` is set to `n - 1`, `l[n - 1]` is 1, `l[x]` is the original value of `l[n - 1]`, `d[1] = n - 1`, `d[l[n - 1]] = x`. If `x >= n // 2`, `y` is set to 0, `l[0]` is 1, `l[x]` is the original value of `l[0]`, `d[1] = 0`, `d[l[0]] = x`. Additionally, the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2` (i.e., `d[a[i]] - i <= n // 2`).**
