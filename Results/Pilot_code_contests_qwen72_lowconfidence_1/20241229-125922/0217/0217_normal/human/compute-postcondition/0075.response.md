The code snippet `y = i` updates the value of `y` to the current value of `i`, which is 2.

The output state is:
**`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `x` is `d[3]`, `y` is 2, `ans` contains either [[1, 1]] or `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[d[2] + 1, 2]`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`).**
