The function `func_16(*i)` is called with `i` being the next element in `ans`. Since `i` is the next element in `ans`, and `ans` must have at least one more element, the call to `func_16` does not affect the value of `ans` or `i` directly. However, the function `func_16` might return a value or modify global state, but this is not specified in the given code snippet.

Since no changes to `i` or `ans` are explicitly shown, and no new variables are introduced, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`func_16(*i)` was called, `i` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must have at least one more element**
