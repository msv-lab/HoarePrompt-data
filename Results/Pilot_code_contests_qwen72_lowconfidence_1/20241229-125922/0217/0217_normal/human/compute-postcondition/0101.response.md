The function `func_16(*i)` is called with the argument `i`, which is the next element in `ans`. Since `ans` must have at least one more element, the function call does not affect the availability of the next element in `ans`. However, the function itself might perform operations that are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact changes it makes. The only certain change is that the function `func_16` has been called with `i`.

Output State: **`func_16(*i)` was called, `i` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must have at least one more element**
