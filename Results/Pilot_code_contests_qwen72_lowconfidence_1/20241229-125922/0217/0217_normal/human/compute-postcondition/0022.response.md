The code `file.flush()` forces the file object to write its buffer to the underlying file, ensuring that all data is written out immediately. This operation does not change the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state except for potentially affecting the state of the `file` object itself, which is flushed. Since the initial state specifies that `flush` is `True`, this indicates that the flush operation should occur.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout` (and its buffer has been flushed), `end` has been written to `file`, `flush` is `True`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` if it was present.**
