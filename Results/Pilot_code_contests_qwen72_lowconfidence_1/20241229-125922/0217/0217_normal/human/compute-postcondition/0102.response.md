According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ans`. If `ans` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `func_16(*i)` was called, `i` is the next element in `ans`, and `ans` must have at least one more element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still have at least one more element left to iterate over. Since `i` is now the current element being processed, `ans` must have at least one more element beyond the current `i`.

State: **`func_16(*i)` was called, `i` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must have at least one more element**
