Output State: **`func_16(*i)` was called for each pair of indices in `ans`, `i` is no longer relevant as the loop has finished iterating over `ans`, `ans` is a list of pairs of indices representing the swaps performed, `l` and `d` may have been modified by `func_16` based on the swaps performed, `a` remains a sorted list of integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).**
