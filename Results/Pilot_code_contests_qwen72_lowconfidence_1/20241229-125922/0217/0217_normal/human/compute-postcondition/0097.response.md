The function `func_16(len(ans))` is called with the length of the list `ans` as its argument. Since the function call does not modify any of the variables directly (assuming `func_16` does not have side effects), the only impact is that the function is executed with the given argument.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
- `l` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l` (updated to reflect the final positions)
- `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order
- `ans` is a list of pairs of indices representing the swaps performed during the loop
- `i` is `n`

The function `func_16` is called with the length of `ans` as the argument. The values of `n`, `l`, `d`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l` (updated to reflect the final positions), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `ans` is a list of pairs of indices representing the swaps performed during the loop, `i` is `n`.**
