Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with `l[x]` and `l[y]` swapped, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l` (updated to reflect the swap), `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 1, `x` is `d[2]`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l`. If `x < n // 2`, then `y` is `n - 1` and `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[x + 1, y + 1]` if the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` also contains `[x + 1, y + 1]`. Otherwise, `y` is 0 and `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[x + 1, y + 1]` if the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.***
