Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 0. If `abs(d[a[i]] - i) >= n // 2`, then `ans` is [[1, 1]], `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`). Otherwise, `l` has elements at positions `0` and `n - 1` swapped, `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[x + 1, y + 1]` (either `[1, n]` or `[n, 1]` and `[1, n]` or `[n, 1]`), `x` is `d[1]` (either `n - 1` or `0`), the absolute difference between `x` and `i` is less than `n // 2`, `y` is 0, and the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.***
