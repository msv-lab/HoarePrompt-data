The code `y = i` assigns the value of `i` to `y`. Given that `i` is 1, `y` is now also 1. This changes the value of `y` from its previous condition, which was dependent on the value of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in their original positions, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 1, `x` is `d[2]`, `y` is 1, `ans` contains `[x + 1, y + 1]` and possibly another `[x + 1, y + 1]` based on the initial conditions.**
