Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with the elements at positions `x` and `y` swapped, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the updated index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `x` is `d[3]`, and `ans` contains either `[[1, 1], [x + 1, y + 1]]` or `[[x + 1, y + 1], [d[2] + 1, 2], [x + 1, y + 1]]`. If `x < n // 2`, then `y` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `y` is 0. The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`).***
