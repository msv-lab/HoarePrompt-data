The code snippet `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` performs the following actions:

- It attempts to pop the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs`. If `'end'` is present in `kwargs`, its value is used for the write operation, and the key-value pair is removed from `kwargs`.
- If `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, the default value `b'\n'` (a newline byte string) is used for the write operation.
- The value of `end` (either from `kwargs` or the default) is written to the file object specified by `file`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a tuple of values of any type.
- `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`.
- `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`.
- `end` is a byte string appended after the last argument.
- `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
- `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.
- Each element of `args` has been converted to a string and written to `file`, separated by `sep` if `args` contains more than one element.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- The `end` value (either from `kwargs` or the default `b'\n'`) has been written to `file`.
- The key `'end'` has been removed from `kwargs` if it was present.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `sep` is the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists, otherwise `b' '`, `file` is the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `end` has been written to `file`, `flush` is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` if it was present.**
