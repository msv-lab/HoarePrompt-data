Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 1. If `a[i] == l[i]` and `abs(d[a[i]] - i) >= n // 2`, then `ans` is [[1, 1]]. If `x < n // 2`, then `y` is `n - 1`; otherwise, `y` is 0. The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`). If `a[i] != l[i]`, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition, and `x` is `d[2]`. If `x < n // 2`, the difference between the index of the element at position `i` in the list `a` and `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and `ans` is a list containing `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[x + 1, y + 1]` (either `[1, n]` or `[n, 1]` and `[1, n]` or `[n, 1]`). If `x` is `d[1]`, the absolute difference between `x` and `i` is less than `n // 2`.***
