The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement would have no effect outside of a loop.

Therefore, none of the variables are affected by the `continue` statement, and the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `l` and the value is the index of that element in `l`, `a` is a sorted list containing integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `x` is either the index of the element 2 in the list `l` or `d[1]` (either `n - 1` or `0`), `y` is 1, `ans` contains either [[1, 1]] or `[x + 1, y + 1]` and `[d[2] + 1, 2]`, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `l` (i.e., `a[0] == l[0]`).**
