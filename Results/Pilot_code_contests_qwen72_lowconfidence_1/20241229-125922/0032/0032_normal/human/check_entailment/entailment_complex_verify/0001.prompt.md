You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX axis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has n positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.

There are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position x, post lamp of power l illuminates the segment [x; x + l]. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.

The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power 1 to power k. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power l cost a_l each.

What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power 3 in position n - 1 (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment [0; n]).

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, m and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.

The second line contains m integer numbers s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... s_m < n) — the blocked positions.

The third line contains k integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the costs of the post lamps.

Output

Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street.

If illumintaing the entire segment [0; n] is impossible, print -1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the entire segment [0; n] cannot be illuminated due to blocked positions, especially when the first position (0) is blocked. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 1 5
0
3 3 3 3 3
```
Expected output: `-1`

The program will incorrectly output `9` instead of `-1`. This is because the program assumes that it can always start placing lamps from position 0, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where position 0 is blocked, making it impossible to illuminate the entire segment.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by two lists: `block` (a list of `m` integers representing blocked positions) and `a` (a list of `k` integers representing the costs of placing post lamps). It then initializes a list `can` of length `n` where each element is 1, except for the positions specified in `block`, which are set to 0. The function computes a list `last_can` of the same length, where each element is the last valid (non-blocked) position up to that point. If the first position is not blocked (`can[0]` is 1), the function calculates the minimum cost to place post lamps such that all non-blocked positions are illuminated. This is done by iterating over each possible lamp cost and determining the minimum number of steps needed to cover all non-blocked positions. The function prints the minimum cost found, or -1 if no valid configuration exists (i.e., if `ans` remains \(10^{13}\)). If the first position is blocked (`can[0]` is 0), the function directly prints -1. The variable `h` is assigned the value 77 but is not used elsewhere in the function.
