Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Input:**
   - The use of `raw_input()` is not appropriate for modern Python (Python 3). In Python 3, the correct function to use is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Initialization and Logic:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large number (`10 ** 13`). This is used to find the minimum cost. However, if no valid solution is found, the program prints `-1` if `ans` remains `10 ** 13`. This part is correct.
   - The logic inside the `if can[0]` block is intended to find the minimum cost by iterating over all possible lamp powers and checking if the entire segment can be illuminated. However, the logic is flawed.

3. **Flawed Logic:**
   - The inner `while` loop is intended to check if the entire segment can be illuminated using a specific lamp power. However, the condition `last_can[x + step] > x` is not sufficient to ensure that the entire segment is illuminated. It should check if the next position can be reached without being blocked.
   - The condition `if x + step >= n` is used to check if the end of the segment is reached. However, this does not account for the possibility that the last position might be blocked, which would make it impossible to illuminate the entire segment.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the entire segment cannot be illuminated due to blocked positions correctly. For example, in the test case where `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 5`, and the blocked position is `0`, the program should return `-1` because the first position is blocked, making it impossible to start illuminating the segment. However, the program might not handle this correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
5 1 5
0
3 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is `-1` because the first position is blocked, making it impossible to start illuminating the segment. However, the program might not correctly handle this case and could return an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
