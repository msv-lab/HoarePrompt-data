You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX axis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has n positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.

There are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position x, post lamp of power l illuminates the segment [x; x + l]. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.

The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power 1 to power k. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power l cost a_l each.

What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power 3 in position n - 1 (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment [0; n]).

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, m and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.

The second line contains m integer numbers s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... s_m < n) — the blocked positions.

The third line contains k integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the costs of the post lamps.

Output

Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street.

If illumintaing the entire segment [0; n] is impossible, print -1.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
