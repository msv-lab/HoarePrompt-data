Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the entire segment [0; n] cannot be illuminated due to blocked positions, especially when the first position (0) is blocked. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 1 5
0
3 3 3 3 3
```
Expected output: `-1`

The program will incorrectly output `9` instead of `-1`. This is because the program assumes that it can always start placing lamps from position 0, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where position 0 is blocked, making it impossible to illuminate the entire segment.
