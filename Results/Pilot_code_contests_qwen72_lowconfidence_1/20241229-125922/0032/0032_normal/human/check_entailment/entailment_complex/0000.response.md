Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling the Case Where the First Position is Blocked**:
   - The program checks if the first position is blocked (`if can[0]`). If it is blocked, the program immediately prints `-1`. However, this is not entirely correct. According to the problem description, if the first position is blocked, it should still try to find a way to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] using the available lamps. For example, if the first position is blocked but the rest of the segment can be illuminated with a single lamp of sufficient power, the program should not return `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Cost**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost by iterating over each possible lamp power and checking if the entire segment can be illuminated. However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of steps needed to cover all non-blocked positions is flawed. Specifically, the inner while loop:
     ```python
     while x + step < n and last_can[x + step] > x:
         cnt += 1
         x = last_can[x + step]
     ```
     This loop does not correctly handle cases where the next valid position is beyond the current step. For example, if the next valid position is at `x + step + 1`, the loop will not correctly account for this and may incorrectly conclude that the segment cannot be illuminated.

3. **Handling the Case Where No Valid Configuration Exists**:
   - The program sets `ans` to `10 ** 13` initially and updates it if a valid configuration is found. However, if no valid configuration exists, the program correctly prints `-1`. This part is correct, but the overall logic leading to this conclusion is flawed due to the issues mentioned above.

4. **Unnecessary Variable**:
   - The variable `h` is assigned the value `77` but is not used anywhere in the function. While this does not affect the correctness of the program, it is unnecessary and should be removed for clarity.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
6 2 3
1 3
1 2 3
```
The expected output is `6`, but the program may incorrectly return `-1` if the first position is blocked.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, particularly when the first position is blocked and when the logic for calculating the minimum number of steps is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
