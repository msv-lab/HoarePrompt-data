Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the last position on the street is blocked, which would make it impossible to illuminate the entire segment [0; n]. Specifically, if the last position `n-1` is blocked, the program does not correctly identify this as an impossible scenario and might still attempt to compute a solution, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 1 5
4
3 3 3 3 3
```
In this case, the last position `4` is blocked, making it impossible to illuminate the entire segment [0; 5). However, the program will still attempt to find a solution and may return an incorrect result instead of `-1`.

This indicates that the program is not handling all edge cases correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
