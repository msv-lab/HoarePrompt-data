You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX axis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has n positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.

There are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position x, post lamp of power l illuminates the segment [x; x + l]. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.

The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power 1 to power k. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power l cost a_l each.

What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power 3 in position n - 1 (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment [0; n]).

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, m and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.

The second line contains m integer numbers s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... s_m < n) — the blocked positions.

The third line contains k integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the costs of the post lamps.

Output

Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street.

If illumintaing the entire segment [0; n] is impossible, print -1.

                x = last_can[x + step]
            if x + step >= n:
                ans = min(ans, cnt * a[i])
    print(-1 if ans == 10 ** 13 else ans)
    h = 77


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the last position on the street is blocked, which would make it impossible to illuminate the entire segment [0; n]. Specifically, if the last position `n-1` is blocked, the program does not correctly identify this as an impossible scenario and might still attempt to compute a solution, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 1 5
4
3 3 3 3 3
```
In this case, the last position `4` is blocked, making it impossible to illuminate the entire segment [0; 5). However, the program will still attempt to find a solution and may return an incorrect result instead of `-1`.

This indicates that the program is not handling all edge cases correctly, and thus it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by two lists: `block` (a list of `m` integers representing blocked positions) and `a` (a list of `k` integers representing the costs of placing post lamps). It then initializes a list `can` of length `n` where each element is 1, except for the positions specified in `block`, which are set to 0. The function computes a list `last_can` of the same length, where each element is the last valid (non-blocked) position up to that point. If the first position is not blocked (`can[0]` is 1), the function calculates the minimum cost to place post lamps such that all non-blocked positions are illuminated. This is done by iterating over each possible lamp cost and determining the minimum number of steps needed to cover all non-blocked positions. The function prints the minimum cost found, or -1 if no valid configuration exists (i.e., if `ans` remains \(10^{13}\)). If the first position is blocked (`can[0]` is 0), the function directly prints -1. The variable `h` is assigned the value 77 but is not used elsewhere in the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
