The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by two lists: `block` (a list of `m` integers representing blocked positions) and `a` (a list of `k` integers representing the costs of placing post lamps). It then initializes a list `can` of length `n` where each element is 1, except for the positions specified in `block`, which are set to 0. The function computes a list `last_can` of the same length, where each element is the last valid (non-blocked) position up to that point. If the first position is not blocked (`can[0]` is 1), the function calculates the minimum cost to place post lamps such that all non-blocked positions are illuminated. This is done by iterating over each possible lamp cost and determining the minimum number of steps needed to cover all non-blocked positions. The function prints the minimum cost found, or -1 if no valid configuration exists (i.e., if `ans` remains \(10^{13}\)). If the first position is blocked (`can[0]` is 0), the function directly prints -1. The variable `h` is assigned the value 77 but is not used elsewhere in the function.
