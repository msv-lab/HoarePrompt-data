You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX axis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps to illuminate it. Street has n positions to install lamps, they correspond to the integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 on the OX axis. However, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.

There are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When placed in position x, post lamp of power l illuminates the segment [x; x + l]. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer number.

The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type from power 1 to power k. Though each customer is only allowed to order post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power l cost a_l each.

What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does not care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power 3 in position n - 1 (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to segment [0; n]).

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, m and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available.

The second line contains m integer numbers s_1, s_2, ..., s_m (0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... s_m < n) — the blocked positions.

The third line contains k integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) — the costs of the post lamps.

Output

Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment [0; n] of the street.

If illumintaing the entire segment [0; n] is impossible, print -1.
