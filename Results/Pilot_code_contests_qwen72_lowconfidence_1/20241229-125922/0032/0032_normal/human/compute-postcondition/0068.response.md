The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was `cnt + 1`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `cnt + 2`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`, `i` is 0, `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 2`, `x` is `last_can[x + step]`**
