The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the total number of positions.
- `m`: An integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ n, representing the number of blocked positions.
- `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of post lamps.
- `s`: A list of m integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions.
- `a`: A list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the costs of the post lamps.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to place the post lamps such that all non-blocked positions are illuminated, given the constraints and the lists provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `a`, and returns the minimum total cost required to place the post lamps to illuminate all non-blocked positions.**
