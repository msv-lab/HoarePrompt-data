Postcondition: ***`x` is the last valid index such that `last_can[x + step] > x` and `x + step < n`, `cnt` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `x + step` or `last_can[x + step]` is less than or equal to `x`. If `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the product of `cnt` and `a[i]`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
