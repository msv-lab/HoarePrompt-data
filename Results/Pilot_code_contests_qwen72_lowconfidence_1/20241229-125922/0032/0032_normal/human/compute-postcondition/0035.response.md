The value of `x` is updated to `last_can[x + step]`. Given the initial state, we know:

- `x` was initially `last_can[2]`.
- `step` is `i + 1`.
- `i` is 1, so `step` is 2.
- `x + step` is `last_can[2] + 2`.

Since `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than `x`, the new value of `x` will be the value of `last_can[last_can[2] + 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than `x + i + 1`, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\), `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0, `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1, `ans` is \(10^{13}\), `can[0]` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `step` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is 3, `x` is `last_can[last_can[2] + 2]`, and `last_can[1]` must be greater than 0, `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than `x`.**
