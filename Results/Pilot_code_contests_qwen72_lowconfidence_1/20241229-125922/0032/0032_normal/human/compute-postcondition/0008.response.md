The code snippet sets the value of `can[x]` to 0, where `x` is the second element of the `block` list. This means that the `x`-th position in the `can` list is now marked as blocked (0), while all other elements remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 and all other elements set to 1, `x` is the second element of `block`.
