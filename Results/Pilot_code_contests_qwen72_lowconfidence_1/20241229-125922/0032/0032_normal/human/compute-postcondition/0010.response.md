The code `can[x] = 0` updates the value of the `can` list at index `x` to 0. Here, `x` is the third element of the `block` list if it exists. The other elements of the `can` list remain unchanged.

- `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their values as they are not modified.
- `s` remains a list of `m` integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions.
- `a` retains its value as the result of the `get()` function.
- `block` remains a non-empty list, and `x` is the third element of `block`.
- The `can` list now has `can[x]` set to 0, and all other elements remain 1 except for the positions in `s` which are already 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 and all other elements set to 1 except those in `s` which are 0, `x` is the third element of `block` (if it exists)**.
