To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **`block` must be a non-empty list**: For the loop to execute, `block` must contain at least one element. If `block` is empty, the loop will not run.

2. **Initialization of `x`**: Before the loop starts, `x` should be the first element of `block`.

Given these requirements, we need to ensure that `block` is non-empty and that `x` is set to the first element of `block`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 â‰¤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` filled with the value 1, `x` is the first element of `block`**
