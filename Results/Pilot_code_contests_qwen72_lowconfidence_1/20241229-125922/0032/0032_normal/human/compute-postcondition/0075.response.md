The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt * a[i])` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the product of `cnt` and `a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is the last valid index such that `last_can[x + step] > x` and `x + step < n`.
- `cnt` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `x + step` or `last_can[x + step]` is less than or equal to `x`.
- The current value of `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The only variable affected by the code snippet is `ans`. The new value of `ans` is the minimum of its current value and the product of `cnt` and `a[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is the last valid index such that `last_can[x + step] > x` and `x + step < n`, `cnt` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `x + step` or `last_can[x + step]` is less than or equal to `x`, the current value of `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is now `min(ans, cnt * a[i])`.**
