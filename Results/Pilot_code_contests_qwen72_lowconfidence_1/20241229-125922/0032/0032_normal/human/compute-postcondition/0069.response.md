The code snippet assigns the value of `last_can[x + step]` to `x`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`
- `i` is 0
- `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0
- `cnt` is `cnt + 2`
- `x` is `last_can[x + step]`

Since `x` is already set to `last_can[x + step]`, the assignment `x = last_can[x + step]` does not change the value of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`, `i` is 0, `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 2`, `x` is `last_can[x + step]`**.
