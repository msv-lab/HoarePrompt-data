Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\), `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0, `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1, `ans` is \(10^{13}\). If `can[0]` is 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum of \(10^{13}\) and the products `cnt * a[i]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `k-1` where the condition `x + step >= n` is satisfied, with `k` being a non-negative integer, `step` being `k + 1`, `cnt` being the number of iterations the inner while loop has executed for the last iteration of the outer for loop, and `x` being the last valid index such that `last_can[x + step] > x` or `x + step >= n` for the last iteration of the outer for loop. If `k` is 0, `ans` remains \(10^{13}\).***
