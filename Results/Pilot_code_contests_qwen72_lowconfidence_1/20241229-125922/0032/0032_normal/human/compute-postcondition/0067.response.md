To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while x + step < n and last_can[x + step] > x:
```

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0
- `cnt` is `cnt + 1`
- `x` is `last_can[x + step]`

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:
1. **Condition 1:** `x + step < n`
   - For this condition to hold, `x + step` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `x` is `last_can[x + step]`, we need to ensure that `last_can[x + step] + step` is still less than `n`.

2. **Condition 2:** `last_can[x + step] > x`
   - This condition requires that the value of `last_can[x + step]` is greater than `x`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **For Condition 1:** We need to ensure that `x + step` is less than `n`. Given that `x` is `last_can[x + step]`, we need to ensure that `last_can[x + step] + step` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`.
- **For Condition 2:** The value of `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than `x`. Since `x` is `last_can[x + step]`, this condition is inherently satisfied as long as `last_can[x + step]` is valid.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`.
- All other states remain the same.

State: **`n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`, `i` is 0, `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, `x` is `last_can[x + step]`**
