Postcondition: ***`x` is the last valid index such that `last_can[x + step] > x` and `x + step < n`, `cnt` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `x + step` or `last_can[x + step]` is less than or equal to `x`. The current value of `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
