The code snippet `ans = 10 ** 13` initializes the variable `ans` with the value \(10^{13}\).

- The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `a`, `block`, `can`, `last_can`, and `last` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `ans` is introduced and set to \(10^{13}\).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\), `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0, `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1, `ans` is \(10^{13}\)**.
