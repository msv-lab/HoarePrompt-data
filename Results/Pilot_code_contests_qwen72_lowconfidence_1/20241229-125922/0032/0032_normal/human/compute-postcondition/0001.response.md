The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` by calling the function `get()`. This function reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer, returning a list of these integers. The first integer in this list is assigned to `n`, the second to `m`, and the third to `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of m integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the costs of the post lamps.**
