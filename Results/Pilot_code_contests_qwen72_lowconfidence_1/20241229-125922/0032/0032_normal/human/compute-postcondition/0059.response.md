Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\), `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0, `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1, `can[0]` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `step` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1, `x` is the last valid index in `last_can` that is reachable from the starting point `0` within the bounds of `n` and the condition `x + step < n and last_can[x + step] > x`, `i` is the number of times the loop executed. If `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt * a[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains \(10^{13}\).***
