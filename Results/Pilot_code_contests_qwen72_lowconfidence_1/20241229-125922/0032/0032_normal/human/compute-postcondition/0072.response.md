The value of `x` is updated to `last_can[x + step]`. Since `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than the previous value of `x`, the new value of `x` is greater than its previous value. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`, `i` is 0, `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 3`, `x` is `last_can[x + step]` (and `x` is greater than its previous value), `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than the previous value of `x`**
