The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is `cnt + 2`, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes `cnt + 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `last_can[x + step] + step`, `i` is 0, `last_can[i + 1]` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 3`, `x` is `last_can[x + step]`, and `last_can[x + step]` must be greater than the previous value of `x`**
