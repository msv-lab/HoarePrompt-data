The code snippet `block = get()` assigns the result of the `get()` function to the variable `block`. Since the specific implementation of `get()` is not provided, we assume that `get()` returns a value or a collection of values. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of m integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the costs of the post lamps, `block` is the result of the `get()` function.**
