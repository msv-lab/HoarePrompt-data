To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. **Condition 1:** `x + step < n`
2. **Condition 2:** `last_can[x + step] > x`

Given the current state:
- `x` is `last_can[last_can[2] + 2]`.
- `step` is `i + 1`, which is 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than `x + i + 1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Condition 1:** `x + step < n`
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x + step` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `step` is 2, this condition translates to `x + 2 < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `x + 2`.

2. **Condition 2:** `last_can[x + step] > x`
   - This condition ensures that the value at `last_can[x + step]` is greater than `x`.
   - Given that `x` is `last_can[last_can[2] + 2]`, we need to ensure that `last_can[x + 2]` is greater than `x`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than `x + 2`**: This ensures that the first condition of the loop (`x + step < n`) is satisfied.
- **`last_can[x + 2]` must be greater than `x`**: This ensures that the second condition of the loop (`last_can[x + step] > x`) is satisfied.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than `x + 2`, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\), `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0, `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1, `ans` is \(10^{13}\), `can[0]` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `step` is `i + 1`, `cnt` is 3, `x` is `last_can[last_can[2] + 2]`, and `last_can[1]` must be greater than 0, `last_can[x + 2]` must be greater than `x`.**
