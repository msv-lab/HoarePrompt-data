The code `last = last_can[i]` updates the value of `last` to the value at index `i` of the list `last_can`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1.
- `last_can` is a list of length `n` where:
  - `last_can[0]` is 0 if `can[0]` is 1 or -1 if `can[0]` is 0.
  - `last_can[1]` is 1 if `can[1]` is 1, or set to `last` if `can[1]` is 0.
  - All other elements are 0.

Since `i` is 1, `last` will be updated to `last_can[1]`.

Given the conditions for `last_can[1]`:
- If `can[1]` is 1, `last_can[1]` is 1.
- If `can[1]` is 0, `last_can[1]` is `last`.

Therefore, the value of `last` will be:
- 1 if `can[1]` is 1.
- `last` if `can[1]` is 0 (but since `last` was initially 0 if `0` is not in `block` or -1 if `0` is in `block`, the value of `last` remains unchanged).

Thus, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input.
- `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n.
- `a` is the result of the `get()` function.
- `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list.
- `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1.
- `last_can` is a list of length `n` with `last_can[0]` set to 0 if `can[0]` is 1 or -1 if `can[0]` is 0, `last_can[1]` set to 1 if `can[1]` is 1, or set to `last` if `can[1]` is 0, and all other elements set to 0.
- `last` is 1 if `can[1]` is 1, otherwise `last` remains unchanged (0 if `0` is not in `block` or -1 if `0` is in `block`).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `last_can` is a list of length `n` with `last_can[0]` set to 0 if `can[0]` is 1 or -1 if `can[0]` is 0, `last_can[1]` set to 1 if `can[1]` is 1, or set to `last` if `can[1]` is 0, and all other elements set to 0, `last` is 1 if `can[1]` is 1, otherwise `last` remains unchanged (0 if `0` is not in `block` or -1 if `0` is in `block`).**
