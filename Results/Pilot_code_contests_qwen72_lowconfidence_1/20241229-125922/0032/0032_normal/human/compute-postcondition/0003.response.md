The code snippet `a = get()` assigns the result of the `get()` function to the variable `a`. Given the initial state, `a` was previously a list of `k` integers representing the costs of the post lamps. After executing the code, `a` is now the result of the `get()` function.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 â‰¤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function.**
