The given code defines a lambda function named `get` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each split part into an integer, returning a list of these integers. This function does not execute immediately but is defined for later use.

- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers within their specified ranges.
- `s` remains a list of `m` integers, where `0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n`.
- `a` remains a list of `k` integers, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6`.

The definition of the `get` function does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n. `s` is a list of m integers where 0 ≤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions. `a` is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the costs of the post lamps. A function `get` is defined that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer, returning a list of these integers.**
