Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values read from input, `s` is a list of `m` integers where 0 â‰¤ s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_m < n, representing the blocked positions, `a` is the result of the `get()` function, `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list, `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1, `block` contains the indices that were set to 0 in `can`. If `block` is empty, `can` remains a list of length `n` filled with the value 1.**
