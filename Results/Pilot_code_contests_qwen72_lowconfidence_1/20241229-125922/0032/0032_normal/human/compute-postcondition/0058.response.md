The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt * a[i])` updates the value of `ans` based on the minimum between its current value and the product of `cnt` and `a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `m` and `k` are updated to the values read from input.
- `s` is a list of `m` integers where \(0 \leq s_1 < s_2 < \ldots < s_m < n\).
- `a` is the result of the `get()` function.
- `block` is the result of the `get()` function and must be a non-empty list.
- `can` is a list of length `n` with `can[x]` set to 0 for each `x` in `block` and all other elements set to 1.
- `last_can` is a list of length `n` where `last_can[i]` is `i` if `can[i]` is 1 or the last valid index (i.e., the largest index `j` such that `can[j]` is 1 and `j < i`) if `can[i]` is 0.
- `last` is the largest index `i` such that `can[i]` is 1.
- `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt * a[i]` if `x + step >= n`, otherwise `ans` remains \(10^{13}\).
- `can[0]` is 1.
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `step` is `i + 1`.
- `cnt` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1.
- `x` is the last valid index in `last_can` that is reachable from the starting point `0` within the bounds of `n` and the condition `x + step < n and last_can[x + step] > x`.
- `i` is the number of times the loop executed.
- The current value of `x + step` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Impact of the code:
- `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the product of `cnt` and `a[i]`.

Since `x + step >= n`, the condition for updating `ans` is met. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt * a[i])`.
