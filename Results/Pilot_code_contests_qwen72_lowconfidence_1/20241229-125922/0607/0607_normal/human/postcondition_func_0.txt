The function `func_1` processes a series of queries where each query consists of a participant number `ai` and a value `vi` representing the number of fish caught or released. The function maintains three lists: `base`, `midway`, and `last`. `base` tracks the cumulative fish count for each participant, `midway` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 100 participants, and `last` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 10,000 participants. For each query, the function updates the fish count in `base` and then updates the corresponding entries in `midway` and `last` to reflect the new maximum fish counts. After processing each query, the function prints the participant number and the maximum fish count found across all participants. If no queries are provided (`q = 0`), the function does not modify the lists and no output is produced. The function handles the constraints on `n` and `q` effectively, ensuring that the lists are appropriately sized and that the maximum fish counts are accurately tracked and updated.
