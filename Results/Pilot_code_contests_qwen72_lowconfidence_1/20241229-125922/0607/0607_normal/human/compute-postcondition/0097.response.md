The code snippet updates the variable `index` to the value of `i`.

- `n` and `q` remain specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000.
- `a` remains a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2.
- `v` remains a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.
- `base` remains a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` remains a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` remains a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` remains the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` remains `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` remains the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` remains `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- `i` remains the next element in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
- `value` remains `base[i]`.
- `index` is now set to the value of `i`.
