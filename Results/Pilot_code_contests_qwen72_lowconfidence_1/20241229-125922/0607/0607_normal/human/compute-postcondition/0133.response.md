The value of `index` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\), `a` is `a - 1` and must be such that `a - 1 < n`, `v` is the integer read from input, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1` and must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`, `value` is `base[i]`, `index` is `i`.**
