The code initializes a list named `base` with `n` elements, where each element is set to 0. The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are specific positive integers within given ranges, and the lists `ai` and `vi` contain specific integers within their respective ranges. After executing the code, the only change is the initialization of the `base` list.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.**
