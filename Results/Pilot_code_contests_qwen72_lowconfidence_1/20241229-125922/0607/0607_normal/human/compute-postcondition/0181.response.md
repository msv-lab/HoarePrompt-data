Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\); `base` is a list of length `n` where each element `base[a]` has been updated by adding `v` for each query `(a, v)`; `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` where each element `midway[b // 100]` holds the index within the block of 100 elements starting at `b` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` where each element `last[c // 10000]` holds the index within the block of 10000 elements starting at `c` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `value` is the maximum value in `base` across all indices specified in `last`; `index` is the index in `base` where this maximum value is found, and `index + 1` and `value` are printed for each query. If `q` is 0, then `base`, `midway`, and `last` remain unchanged from their initial state, and no values are printed.**
