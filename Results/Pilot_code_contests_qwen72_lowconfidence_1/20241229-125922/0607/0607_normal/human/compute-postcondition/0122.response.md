To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\).
- `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\).
- `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\).
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- `value` is the maximum value in `base` at the indices specified in `last`.
- `index` is the index in `last` that corresponds to the maximum value in `base`.
- The values of `index + 1` and `value` are printed.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for _ in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates `q` times.
- At the start of each iteration, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- The loop body is omitted, but we need to determine the state changes required for the next iteration.

### State Adjustments:
- Since the loop counter `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not directly affect the state.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `v`, `base`, `midway`, `last`, `b`, `end`, `c`, `cc`, `value`, and `index` are all derived from the initial conditions and the loop body.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` should be incremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the loop counter `_`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\), `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\), `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\), `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`, `value` is the maximum value in `base` at the indices specified in `last`, `index` is the index in `last` that corresponds to the maximum value in `base`**.
