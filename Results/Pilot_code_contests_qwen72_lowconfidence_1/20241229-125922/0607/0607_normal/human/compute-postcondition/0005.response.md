The code snippet reads two integers from a single line of input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `v`. The values of `a` and `v` will depend on the input provided, but they are constrained by the conditions given in the initial state.

- `a` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n.
- `v` will be an integer such that -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.

The initial state remains unchanged for all other variables (`n`, `q`, `base`, `midway`, `last`). The only changes are the assignment of new values to `a` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`**
