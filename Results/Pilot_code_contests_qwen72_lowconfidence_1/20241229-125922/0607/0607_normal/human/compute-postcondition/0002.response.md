The code initializes a new list named `midway` with a length calculated as `n // 100 + 1`, and each element in this list is set to 0.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`**
