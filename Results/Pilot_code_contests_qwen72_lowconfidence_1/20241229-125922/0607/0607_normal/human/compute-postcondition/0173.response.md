The code snippet assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `index`. This does not affect the values of `_`, `a`, `b`, `end`, `c`, `cc`, or `value`. Therefore, the Output State includes all the initial conditions with the addition of the new value for `index`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, `value` is `base[i]`, `index` is `i`**
