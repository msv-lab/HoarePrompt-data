The value of `a` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is known to be within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ n. After decrementing, the new value of `a` is within the range 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`**
