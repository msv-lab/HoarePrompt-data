To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(b, end):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Range**:
   - The loop iterates from `b` to `end - 1`.
   - `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
   - `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be less than `end`.
   - Since `b` is a multiple of 100 and `end` is either `b + 100` or `n`, the loop will execute if `b < n`.

3. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` and `q` are specific positive integers within given ranges.
   - `a` is an integer within the range [0, n-1].
   - `v` is an integer within the range [-100, 100].
   - `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`.
   - `midway` and `last` are lists initialized to specific lengths.
   - `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
   - `index` is set to `b`.
   - `value` is set to `base[b]`.
   - `end` is calculated based on `b` and `n`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `b < end`.
   - Given the definitions of `b` and `end`, the loop will always execute at least once if `b` is a valid multiple of 100 and `b < n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `b` must be a valid multiple of 100 and less than `n`.
- `end` must be correctly calculated as `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `b` is a valid multiple of 100 and less than `n`, and `end` is correctly set.

State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `index` is `b`, `value` is `base[b]`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`**
