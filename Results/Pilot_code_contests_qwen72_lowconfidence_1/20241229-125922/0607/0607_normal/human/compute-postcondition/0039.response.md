Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`. If `value` (which is `base[c]`) is less than `base[i]`, then `midway[b // 100]` is set to `i` and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `midway[b // 100]` remains as `index`. `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `cc + 1` and `cc + 100` must be less than or equal to `len(midway)`.***
