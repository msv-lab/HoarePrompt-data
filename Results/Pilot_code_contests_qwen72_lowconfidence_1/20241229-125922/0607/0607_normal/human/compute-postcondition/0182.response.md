The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately, without executing any further code. This means that no changes occur to any of the variables in the current state. Since the program exits, the state remains exactly as it was before the `exit()` call.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\); `base` is a list of length `n` where each element `base[a]` has been updated by adding `v` for each query `(a, v)`; `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` where each element `midway[b // 100]` holds the index within the block of 100 elements starting at `b` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` where each element `last[c // 10000]` holds the index within the block of 10000 elements starting at `c` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `value` is the maximum value in `base` across all indices specified in `last`; `index` is the index in `base` where this maximum value is found.**
