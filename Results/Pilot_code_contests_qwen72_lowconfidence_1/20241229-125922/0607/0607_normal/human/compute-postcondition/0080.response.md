To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000.
- `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2.
- `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a+1`.
- `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `(a+1) / 100`.
- `i` is `b + 1` if `b + 1 < end` else `end`.
- If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(b, end):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `b` to `end - 1`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - `i` should be `b + 1` if `b + 1 < end` else `end` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `value` and `index` may change based on the condition `value < base[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:
- **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `b + 1` if `b + 1 < end` else `end`.
- **Next Iteration**:
  - `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `b + 2` if `b + 2 < end` else `end`.
  - If `value < base[i]` (where `i` is now `b + 2`), then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `b + 2` if `b + 2 < end` else `end`.
- `value` and `index` are updated based on the condition `value < base[i]`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2, `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a+1`, `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `(a+1) / 100`, `i` is `b + 2` if `b + 2 < end` else `end`. If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` remain unchanged.**
