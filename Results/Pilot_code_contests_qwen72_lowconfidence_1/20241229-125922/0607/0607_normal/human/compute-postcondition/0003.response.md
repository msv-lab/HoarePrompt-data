The code initializes a new list `last` with a length of `n // 10000 + 1`, setting all its elements to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `base`, or `midway`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`.
Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`**
