To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

The for loop statement is:
```python
for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **`midway` List Initialization and Updates:**
   - `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`.
   - `midway[b // 100]` is set to `index`.

2. **`cc` Calculation:**
   - `cc` is calculated as `c // 100`.
   - `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.

3. **Slicing `midway`:**
   - The loop iterates over `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
   - For the loop to execute, the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]` must contain at least one element.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- **`cc` must be within valid bounds:** `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- **`midway` must have at least 100 elements starting from `cc` to `cc + 100` to ensure the loop can iterate.**

### Adjusting the State:
- **`cc` must be valid:** Ensure `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- **`midway` must be properly initialized and updated:** Ensure `midway[b // 100]` is set to `index`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000.
- `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2.
- `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is `c // 100`.
- `index` is equal to `c`.
- `value` is equal to `base[c]`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- Ensure `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- Ensure `midway[b // 100]` is set to `index`.

State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2, `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, `index` is equal to `c`, `value` is equal to `base[c]`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.**
