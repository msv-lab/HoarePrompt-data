To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000.
- `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1.
- `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `index` is the value at `last[0]`.
- `value` is `base[index]`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `a / 100`.
- `i` is the first element of `last`.
- If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in last:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `last`.
2. **Initial State**: At the start of the loop, `i` is the first element of `last`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `last`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `last`.

### Updated State:
- `n` and `q` remain unchanged.
- `a`, `v`, `base`, `midway`, `last`, `b`, `end`, `index`, `value`, `c`, and `cc` remain unchanged.
- `i` is updated to the next element in `last`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `index` is the value at `last[0]`, `value` is `base[index]`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `a / 100`, and `i` is the next element of `last`. If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`.**
