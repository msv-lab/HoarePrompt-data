The value of `index` is updated to the current value of `i`. All other variables (`_`, `a`, `b`, `end`, `c`, `cc`, `value`) remain unchanged. The condition `value < base[i]` does not affect the current assignment of `index`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `last`, `_` is `_ + 1`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 2`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a - 1`, `cc` is `c // 100`, `value` is `base[i]`, `index` is `i`**.
