Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `a / 100`. After the loop, `value` is the maximum value in `base` at the indices specified in `last`, and `index` is the index in `base` where this maximum value is found. If `last` is empty, `value` remains the initial value (`base[index]`) and `index` remains the initial index.**
