The variable `c` is calculated as `a - a % 10000`. This means `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000.
- `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1.
- `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100.
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `index` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist `base[b:end]`.
- `value` is the maximum value in the sublist `base[b:end]`.

After executing the code `c = a - a % 10000`, the variable `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
