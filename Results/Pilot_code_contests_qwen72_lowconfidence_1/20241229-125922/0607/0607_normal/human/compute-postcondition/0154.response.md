To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions and variables involved in the loop's execution. Let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\).
- `a` is `a - 1` and must be such that `a - 1 < n`.
- `v` is the integer read from input.
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `c`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `c`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1` and must be less than `n`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is `c // 100`.
- `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` remain unchanged.
- `midway` must have at least 100 elements starting from `cc`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `midway[cc:cc + 100]`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are at least 100 elements in `midway` starting from `cc`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`cc`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cc` must be adjusted to the next valid index. Since `cc` is `c // 100`, and `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, we need to ensure that `cc` is incremented correctly.
   - **`a`**: `a` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `a` should be `a - 1`.
   - **`b`**: `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1`. As `a` is decremented, `b` will also be adjusted accordingly.
   - **`end`**: `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`. This will be recalculated based on the new value of `b`.
   - **`c`**: `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`. As `a` is decremented, `c` will also be adjusted.
   - **`cc`**: `cc` is `c // 100`. As `c` changes, `cc` will also change.

3. **New State**:
   - `a` is `a - 1`.
   - `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1`.
   - `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
   - `cc` is `c // 100`.
   - `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
   - `midway` must have at least 100 elements starting from the new `cc`.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\), `a` is `a - 1` and must be such that `a - 1 < n`, `v` is the integer read from input, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `c`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `c`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1` and must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`. If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is updated to `base[i]` and `index` is updated to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` remain unchanged. `midway` must have at least 100 elements starting from `cc`.**
