The code snippet `end = b + 100 if b + 100 < n else n` sets the value of `end` based on the condition that if `b + 100` is less than `n`, then `end` is set to `b + 100`. Otherwise, `end` is set to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000
- `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1
- `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`
- `index` is `b`
- `value` is `base[b]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `end` is calculated as follows:
  - If `b + 100` is less than `n`, then `end` is set to `b + 100`.
  - Otherwise, `end` is set to `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `index` is `b`, `value` is `base[b]`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`**
