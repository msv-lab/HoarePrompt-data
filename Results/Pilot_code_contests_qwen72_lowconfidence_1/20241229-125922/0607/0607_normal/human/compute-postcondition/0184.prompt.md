You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000. Each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, representing the participant number and the number of fish caught or released, respectively.
def func_1(readline):
    n, q = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
    base = [0] * n
    midway = [0] * (n // 100 + 1)
    last = [0] * (n // 10000 + 1)
    for _ in range(q):
        a, v = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        
        a -= 1
        
        base[a] += v

        c = a - a % 10000
        
        cc = c // 100
        
        index = c
        
        value = base[c]
        
        for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]

        print(index + 1, value)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\); `base` is a list of length `n` where each element `base[a]` has been updated by adding `v` for each query `(a, v)`; `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` where each element `midway[b // 100]` holds the index within the block of 100 elements starting at `b` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` where each element `last[c // 10000]` holds the index within the block of 10000 elements starting at `c` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `value` is the maximum value in `base` across all indices specified in `last`; `index` is the index in `base` where this maximum value is found, and `index + 1` and `value` are printed for each query. If `q` is 0, then `base`, `midway`, and `last` remain unchanged from their initial state, and no values are printed.
    exit()
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `readline` that provides pairs of integers (participant number `ai` and the number of fish caught or released `vi`). It processes these pairs and returns the final count of fish for each participant after all operations, considering the constraints on `n`, `q`, `ai`, and `vi`.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
