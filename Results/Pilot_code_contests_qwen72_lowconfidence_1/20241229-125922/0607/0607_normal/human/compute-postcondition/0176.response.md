The value of `value` is updated to the value of `base[i]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in `last`, `_` is `_ + 1`, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 2`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a - 1`, `cc` is `c // 100`, `value` is `base[i]`, `index` remains unchanged unless the condition `value < base[i]` was met in the previous iteration.**
