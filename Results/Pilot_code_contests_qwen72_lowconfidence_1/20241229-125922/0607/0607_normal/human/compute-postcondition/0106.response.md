Initial State:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\)
- `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\)
- `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\)
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`
- `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`
- `value` is the maximum value among `base[i]` for all `i` in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]` that is greater than the initial `value`, and `index` is the corresponding index `i` of this maximum value. If no such `i` exists, `value` and `index` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `index` is now `last[0]`

Given Code:
```python
value = base[index]
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. The variable `value` is assigned the value of `base[index]`.
2. The value of `index` is currently `last[0]`.
3. Therefore, `value` is updated to `base[last[0]]`.

Output State:
