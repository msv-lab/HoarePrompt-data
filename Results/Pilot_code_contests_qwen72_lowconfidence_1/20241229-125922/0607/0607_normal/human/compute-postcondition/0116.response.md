To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\).
- `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\).
- `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\).
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- `i` is the next element in the `last` list.
- If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is set to `base[i]` and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` retain their previous values.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in last:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the elements in the `last` list. Each element in `last` is an index into the `base` list.
2. **State Variables**:
   - `i` is the current element in the `last` list.
   - `value` and `index` are updated based on the comparison with `base[i]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` should be set to the next element in the `last` list.
- **`value` and `index`**: These variables may or may not change depending on the condition `value < base[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `q` remain unchanged.
   - `a` and `v` remain unchanged.
   - `base` remains unchanged.
   - `midway` remains unchanged.
   - `last` remains unchanged.
   - `b`, `end`, `c`, and `cc` remain unchanged.
   - `i` is the current element in the `last` list.
   - `value` and `index` are the current values based on the previous iteration.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` should be set to the next element in the `last` list.
   - `value` and `index` should be updated based on the new `i`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is the next element in the `last` list.
- `value` and `index` are updated if `value < base[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\), `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\), `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\), `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`, `i` is the next element in the `last` list. If `value < base[i]`, then `value` is set to `base[i]` and `index` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `value` and `index` retain their previous values.**
