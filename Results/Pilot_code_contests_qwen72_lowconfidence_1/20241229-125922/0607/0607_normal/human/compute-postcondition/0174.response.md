Postcondition: ***_ is incremented by 1, `a` is `a - 1`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a - 1`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`. If `value < base[i]`, `value` is set to `base[i]` and `index` is set to `i`.***
