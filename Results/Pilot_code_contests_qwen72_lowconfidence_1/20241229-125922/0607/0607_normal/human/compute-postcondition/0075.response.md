Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2, `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to the index `i` where `base[i]` is the maximum value found in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a+1`, `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `(a+1) / 100`, `value` is the maximum value in `base` at the indices specified in `last`. If `value` is less than `base[i]`, then `index` is updated to `i`, `value` is updated to `base[i]`, and `index + 1` and `value` are printed. Otherwise, the original `index` and `value` remain unchanged.***
