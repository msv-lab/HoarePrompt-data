The line of code reads two space-separated values from the input and assigns them to `n` and `q` respectively, converting them to integers. This means that `n` and `q` now hold the specific integer values read from the input. The other conditions about the ranges of `n`, `q`, `ai`, and `vi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, representing the participant number and the number of fish caught or released, respectively.**
