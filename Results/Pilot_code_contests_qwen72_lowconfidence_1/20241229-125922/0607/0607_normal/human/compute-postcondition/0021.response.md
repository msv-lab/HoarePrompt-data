To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\).
- `a` is an integer where \(0 \leq a \leq n-1\).
- `v` is an integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\).
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `i` is `b + 1`.
- If `base[b]` is less than `base[i]`, then `index` is updated to `b + 1` and `value` is updated to `base[b + 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `index` and `value` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(b, end):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `b` to `end - 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `end`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `b + 1`.
   - `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Increment `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- **Check `i < end`**: After incrementing `i`, it must still be less than `end` for the loop to continue.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `b + 2`.
- The condition `i < end` must still hold true.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `i` is `b + 2`. If `base[b]` is less than `base[i]`, then `index` is updated to `b + 2` and `value` is updated to `base[b + 2]`. Otherwise, the values of `index` and `value` remain unchanged.**
