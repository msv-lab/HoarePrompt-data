The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `readline`. This parameter is expected to provide input data, which consists of two types of integers: participants' numbers (`ai`) and the number of fish caught or released (`vi`). The constraints are that `n` and `q` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, each `ai` is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each `vi` is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100.

The function processes this input and returns the result based on the operations (catching or releasing fish) associated with each participant. However, the specific output or return type is not explicitly described in the given information. Assuming the function returns a summary of the final counts of fish for each participant after all operations, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `readline` that provides pairs of integers (participant number `ai` and the number of fish caught or released `vi`). It processes these pairs and returns the final count of fish for each participant after all operations, considering the constraints on `n`, `q`, `ai`, and `vi`.**
