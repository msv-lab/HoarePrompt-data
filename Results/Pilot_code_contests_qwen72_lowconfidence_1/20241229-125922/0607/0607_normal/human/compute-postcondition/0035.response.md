Postcondition: ***`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `i` if `base[i]` is greater than `value`, otherwise `midway[b // 100]` remains as `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `index` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `value` is `base[c]`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is the largest multiple of 100 (in terms of count) less than or equal to `a / 100`, `cc` must be between 0 and `len(midway) - 1`, and `cc + 100` must be less than or equal to `len(midway)`.***
