To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\).
- `a` is a specific integer where \(-1 \leq a \leq n-2\).
- `v` is a specific integer where \(-100 \leq v \leq 100\).
- `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively.
- `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`.
- `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`.
- `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`.
- `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`.
- `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`.
- `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`.
- If `value < base[i]`, then `index` is set to `i` and `value` is set to `base[i]`. Otherwise, `index` and `value` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
2. **Index `i`**: The loop variable `i` will take values from `midway[cc]` to `midway[cc + 99]`.
3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `cc` must remain the same for the loop to continue iterating over the same slice.
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustments:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be the next element in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
- **`value` and `index`**: These will be updated based on the condition `if value < base[i]`.

### Final State:
- `i` is the next element in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`.
- `value` and `index` will be updated if the condition `if value < base[i]` is met.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is a specific integer where -1 ≤ a ≤ n-2, `v` is a specific integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a+1]` and `base[a]` updated to `base[a+1] + v` and `base[a] + v` respectively, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)` with `midway[b // 100]` set to `index`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)` with `last[c // 10000]` set to `index`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`, `c` is the largest multiple of 10000 less than or equal to `a`, `cc` is `c // 100`, and `0 <= cc < len(midway) - 99`. `i` is the next element in the slice `midway[cc:cc + 100]`. If `value < base[i]`, then `index` is set to `i` and `value` is set to `base[i]`. Otherwise, `index` and `value` remain unchanged.**
