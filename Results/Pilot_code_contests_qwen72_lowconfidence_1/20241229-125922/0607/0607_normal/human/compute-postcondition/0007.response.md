The value of `base[a]` is incremented by `v`. Since `a` is a specific index in the range 0 to `n-1`, and `v` is a specific integer in the range -100 to 100, the new value of `base[a]` is `base[a] + v`. The other lists `midway` and `last` remain unchanged, as well as the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`**
