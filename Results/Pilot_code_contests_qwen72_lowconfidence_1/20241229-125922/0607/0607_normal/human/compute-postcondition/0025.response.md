Output State: **`n` and `q` are specific positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer where 0 ≤ a ≤ n-1, `v` is an integer where -100 ≤ v ≤ 100, `base` is a list of length `n` with `base[a]` updated to `base[a] + v`, `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 100 + 1)`, `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` initialized to `[0] * (n // 10000 + 1)`, `b` is the largest multiple of 100 less than or equal to `a` and `b` must be less than `n`, `end` is `b + 100` if `b + 100 < n` else `n`. After the loop completes, `index` is the index of the maximum value in the sublist `base[b:end]`, and `value` is the maximum value in the sublist `base[b:end]`.**
