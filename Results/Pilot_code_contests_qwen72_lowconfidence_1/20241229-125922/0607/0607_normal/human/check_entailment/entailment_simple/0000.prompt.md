You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. It seems that catch and release is recommended this time.

Create a program that reads the participant number and the number of fish caught or released in order as one event, and outputs the participant number and the number of animals that have acquired the most smelt immediately after each event. please. If there are multiple participants with the highest number of participants (or if all participants are 0), output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n q
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
aq vq


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000) represents the number of participants and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) represents the number of events. ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) vi (-100 ≤ vi ≤ 100) indicates that participant ai acquired or released vi at the i-th event. For vi, a positive value indicates acquisition, a negative value indicates release, and 0 is never given.

output

For each event, the participant number and the number of participants who have acquired the most smelt at hand are output on one line separated by one blank.

Example

Input

3 5
1 4
2 5
1 3
3 6
2 7


Output

1 4
2 5
1 7
1 7
2 12
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin, exit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 100000. Each ai is an integer where 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, and each vi is an integer where -100 ≤ vi ≤ 100, representing the participant number and the number of fish caught or released, respectively.
def func_1(readline):
    n, q = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
    base = [0] * n
    midway = [0] * (n // 100 + 1)
    last = [0] * (n // 10000 + 1)
    for _ in range(q):
        a, v = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        
        a -= 1
        
        base[a] += v
        
        b = a - a % 100
        
        index = b
        
        value = base[b]
        
        end = b + 100 if b + 100 < n else n
        
        for i in range(b, end):
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        
        midway[b // 100] = index
        
        c = a - a % 10000
        
        cc = c // 100
        
        index = c
        
        value = base[c]
        
        for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        
        last[c // 10000] = index
        
        index = last[0]
        
        value = base[index]
        
        for i in last:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        
        print(index + 1, value)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `q` are specific positive integers where \(1 \leq n \leq 1000000\) and \(1 \leq q \leq 100000\); `base` is a list of length `n` where each element `base[a]` has been updated by adding `v` for each query `(a, v)`; `midway` is a list of length `n // 100 + 1` where each element `midway[b // 100]` holds the index within the block of 100 elements starting at `b` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `last` is a list of length `n // 10000 + 1` where each element `last[c // 10000]` holds the index within the block of 10000 elements starting at `c` where the maximum value in `base` is found; `value` is the maximum value in `base` across all indices specified in `last`; `index` is the index in `base` where this maximum value is found, and `index + 1` and `value` are printed for each query. If `q` is 0, then `base`, `midway`, and `last` remain unchanged from their initial state, and no values are printed.
    exit()

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
