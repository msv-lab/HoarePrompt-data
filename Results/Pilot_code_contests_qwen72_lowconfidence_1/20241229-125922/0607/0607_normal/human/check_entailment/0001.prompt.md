You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. It seems that catch and release is recommended this time.

Create a program that reads the participant number and the number of fish caught or released in order as one event, and outputs the participant number and the number of animals that have acquired the most smelt immediately after each event. please. If there are multiple participants with the highest number of participants (or if all participants are 0), output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n q
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
aq vq


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000) represents the number of participants and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) represents the number of events. ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) vi (-100 ≤ vi ≤ 100) indicates that participant ai acquired or released vi at the i-th event. For vi, a positive value indicates acquisition, a negative value indicates release, and 0 is never given.

output

For each event, the participant number and the number of participants who have acquired the most smelt at hand are output on one line separated by one blank.

Example

Input

Program:

        a -= 1
        base[a] += v
        b = a - a % 100
        index = b
        value = base[b]
        end = b + 100 if b + 100 < n else n
        for i in range(b, end):
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        midway[b // 100] = index
        c = a - a % 10000
        cc = c // 100
        index = c
        value = base[c]
        for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        last[c // 10000] = index
        index = last[0]
        value = base[index]
        for i in last:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        print(index + 1, value)
    exit()

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
