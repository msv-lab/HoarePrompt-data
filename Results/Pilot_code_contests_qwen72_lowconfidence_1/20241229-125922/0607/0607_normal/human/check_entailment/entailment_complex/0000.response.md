Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` and `q` are read from the input, representing the number of participants and the number of events, respectively.
   - `base` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, representing the cumulative fish count for each participant.
   - `midway` and `last` are auxiliary lists used to efficiently track the maximum fish count within blocks of 100 and 10,000 participants, respectively.

2. **Processing Each Event**:
   - For each event, the participant number `a` and the number of fish caught or released `v` are read.
   - The participant number `a` is adjusted to be 0-indexed by subtracting 1.
   - The fish count for participant `a` is updated in the `base` list.
   - The `midway` list is updated to reflect the new maximum fish count within the block of 100 participants starting at the beginning of the block containing `a`.
   - The `last` list is updated to reflect the new maximum fish count within the block of 10,000 participants starting at the beginning of the block containing `a`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Fish Count**:
   - After updating the fish counts, the program finds the participant with the maximum fish count across all participants by checking the `last` list.
   - The participant number and the maximum fish count are printed.

4. **Handling Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints on `n` and `q` effectively. The lists `base`, `midway`, and `last` are appropriately sized to accommodate the maximum possible values of `n` and `q`.
   - The program ensures that the maximum fish count is accurately tracked and updated for each event, even if the number of participants is large.

5. **Output**:
   - For each event, the program prints the participant number and the number of fish they have acquired, which is the maximum among all participants at that point.

Given that the program correctly processes each event, updates the fish counts, and finds the participant with the maximum fish count, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
