Final: **False**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Complexity and Potential Bugs:**
   - The program uses a complex mechanism involving `base`, `midway`, and `last` arrays to keep track of the maximum values and their indices. This approach introduces unnecessary complexity and potential bugs.
   - The way the `midway` and `last` arrays are updated and used is not straightforward and can lead to incorrect results in certain cases, especially with edge cases where block boundaries are not aligned properly or updates are not correctly propagated.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The original assessment mentioned that the program might not correctly update the `midway` and `last` arrays, leading to incorrect results. This is a valid concern, as the program's logic for updating these arrays is intricate and prone to errors.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     3 5
     1 4
     2 5
     1 3
     3 6
     2 7
     ```
     The expected output is:
     ```
     1 4
     2 5
     1 7
     1 7
     2 12
     ```
     However, due to the complex logic and potential misalignment of block boundaries, the program might not correctly update the `midway` and `last` arrays, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Simpler Approach:**
   - A simpler and more reliable approach would be to directly maintain a dictionary to keep track of the current scores and a variable to keep track of the maximum score and its corresponding participant. This would ensure that the program works correctly for all potential cases.

Given the complexity and potential issues with the current implementation, the original assessment of **False** is accurate. The program does not meet the problem description reliably due to its complex and error-prone logic.
