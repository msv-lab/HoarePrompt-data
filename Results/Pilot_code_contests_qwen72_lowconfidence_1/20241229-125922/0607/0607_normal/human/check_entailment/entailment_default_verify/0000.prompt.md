You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. It seems that catch and release is recommended this time.

Create a program that reads the participant number and the number of fish caught or released in order as one event, and outputs the participant number and the number of animals that have acquired the most smelt immediately after each event. please. If there are multiple participants with the highest number of participants (or if all participants are 0), output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n q
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
aq vq


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000) represents the number of participants and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) represents the number of events. ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) vi (-100 ≤ vi ≤ 100) indicates that participant ai acquired or released vi at the i-th event. For vi, a positive value indicates acquisition, a negative value indicates release, and 0 is never given.

output

For each event, the participant number and the number of participants who have acquired the most smelt at hand are output on one line separated by one blank.

                value = base[i]

                value = base[i]

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all participants have the same number of fish, which is zero. According to the problem description, if all participants have the same number of fish, the program should output the participant with the lowest participant number. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this condition and might not return the correct participant in such a scenario. Specifically, the logic for updating the `index` and `value` variables does not ensure that the lowest participant number is selected when all values are zero. This can lead to incorrect outputs in edge cases where all participants start with zero fish and no fish are added or released.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` processes a series of queries where each query consists of a participant number `ai` and a value `vi` representing the number of fish caught or released. The function maintains three lists: `base`, `midway`, and `last`. `base` tracks the cumulative fish count for each participant, `midway` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 100 participants, and `last` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 10,000 participants. For each query, the function updates the fish count in `base` and then updates the corresponding entries in `midway` and `last` to reflect the new maximum fish counts. After processing each query, the function prints the participant number and the maximum fish count found across all participants. If no queries are provided (`q = 0`), the function does not modify the lists and no output is produced. The function handles the constraints on `n` and `q` effectively, ensuring that the lists are appropriately sized and that the maximum fish counts are accurately tracked and updated.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
