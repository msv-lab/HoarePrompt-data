Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses a complex mechanism involving `base`, `midway`, and `last` arrays to keep track of the maximum values and their indices. However, this approach introduces unnecessary complexity and potential bugs. Specifically, the way the `midway` and `last` arrays are updated and used is not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

One potential issue is the handling of the `midway` and `last` arrays. The program assumes that the maximum value within a block (100 or 10000 elements) is always correctly updated and propagated. However, this assumption can fail in edge cases where the block boundaries are not aligned properly or the updates are not correctly propagated.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 5
1 4
2 5
1 3
3 6
2 7
```
The expected output is:
```
1 4
2 5
1 7
1 7
2 12
```
However, due to the complex logic and potential misalignment of block boundaries, the program might not correctly update the `midway` and `last` arrays, leading to incorrect results.

A simpler and more reliable approach would be to directly maintain a dictionary to keep track of the current scores and a variable to keep track of the maximum score and its corresponding participant. This would ensure that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
