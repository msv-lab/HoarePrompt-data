You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A smelt fishing tournament was held at Lake Hibara. It seems that catch and release is recommended this time.

Create a program that reads the participant number and the number of fish caught or released in order as one event, and outputs the participant number and the number of animals that have acquired the most smelt immediately after each event. please. If there are multiple participants with the highest number of participants (or if all participants are 0), output the one with the lowest participant number.



input

The input is given in the following format.


n q
a1 v1
a2 v2
::
aq vq


n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000) represents the number of participants and q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100000) represents the number of events. ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) vi (-100 ≤ vi ≤ 100) indicates that participant ai acquired or released vi at the i-th event. For vi, a positive value indicates acquisition, a negative value indicates release, and 0 is never given.

output

For each event, the participant number and the number of participants who have acquired the most smelt at hand are output on one line separated by one blank.

Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin, exit

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1(readline=stdin.readline):
    (n, q) = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
    base = [0] * n
    midway = [0] * (n // 100 + 1)
    last = [0] * (n // 10000 + 1)
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, v) = (int(s) for s in readline().split())
        a -= 1
        base[a] += v
        b = a - a % 100
        index = b
        value = base[b]
        end = b + 100 if b + 100 < n else n
        for i in range(b, end):
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        midway[b // 100] = index
        c = a - a % 10000
        cc = c // 100
        index = c
        value = base[c]
        for i in midway[cc:cc + 100]:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        last[c // 10000] = index
        index = last[0]
        value = base[index]
        for i in last:
            if value < base[i]:
                value = base[i]
                index = i
        print(index + 1, value)
    exit()


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` processes a series of queries where each query consists of a participant number `ai` and a value `vi` representing the number of fish caught or released. The function maintains three lists: `base`, `midway`, and `last`. `base` tracks the cumulative fish count for each participant, `midway` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 100 participants, and `last` tracks the index of the maximum fish count within blocks of 10,000 participants. For each query, the function updates the fish count in `base` and then updates the corresponding entries in `midway` and `last` to reflect the new maximum fish counts. After processing each query, the function prints the participant number and the maximum fish count found across all participants. If no queries are provided (`q = 0`), the function does not modify the lists and no output is produced. The function handles the constraints on `n` and `q` effectively, ensuring that the lists are appropriately sized and that the maximum fish counts are accurately tracked and updated.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
