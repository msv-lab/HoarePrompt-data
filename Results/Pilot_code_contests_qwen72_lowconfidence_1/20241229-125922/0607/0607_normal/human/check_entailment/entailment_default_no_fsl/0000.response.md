Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to output the participant with the lowest participant number in case of a tie. The program uses a complex structure involving `base`, `midway`, and `last` lists to keep track of the maximum fish counts, but it does not ensure that the participant with the lowest number is chosen in case of a tie.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:
```
3 5
1 4
2 5
1 3
3 6
2 7
```

The expected output should be:
```
1 4
2 5
1 7
1 7
2 12
```

However, the program's current logic may produce incorrect results in certain scenarios. For example, if the fish counts for multiple participants are the same, the program does not guarantee that the participant with the lowest number is chosen. This is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirement of selecting the participant with the lowest number in case of a tie.
