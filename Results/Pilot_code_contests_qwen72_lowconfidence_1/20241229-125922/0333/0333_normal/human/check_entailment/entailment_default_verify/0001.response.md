Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not directly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` generate coefficients, but they do not perform the alternating addition and subtraction operations on the input list as required by the problem description. The program lacks the main logic to handle the input and perform the specified operations to produce the final result. 

For example, given the input:
```
5
3 6 9 12 15
```

The expected output is `36`, but the provided functions do not perform the necessary operations to achieve this result. They generate coefficients that are not used in the context of the problem's requirements. Thus, the program fails to meet the problem's specifications. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
