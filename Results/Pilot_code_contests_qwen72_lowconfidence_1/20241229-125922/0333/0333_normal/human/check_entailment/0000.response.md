Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not directly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be attempting to generate coefficients or sequences that might be used in solving the problem, but they do not directly implement the alternating addition and subtraction process as required.

Here are a few issues with the provided program:

1. **Direct Implementation Missing**: The program does not contain a function that directly takes the initial list of integers, performs the alternating addition and subtraction, and returns the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Purpose Unclear**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not clearly related to the problem of alternating addition and subtraction. They appear to be generating some kind of sequence, but it's not evident how these sequences are used to solve the problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The problem requires the final result to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It's not clear from the provided code whether this operation is being performed correctly or at all.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when the input list has only one element or when the list has an even number of elements. The problem description specifies that the operations should alternate starting with addition, and the program does not explicitly show this behavior.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
