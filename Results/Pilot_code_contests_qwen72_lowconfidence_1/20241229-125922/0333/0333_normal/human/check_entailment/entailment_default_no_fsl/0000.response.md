Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the alternating addition and subtraction as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to generate coefficients that are used to compute the final result, but they do not correctly implement the alternating addition and subtraction pattern required by the problem.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates coefficients using a formula that does not directly correspond to the alternating addition and subtraction pattern. The formula used in `func_1` is not aligned with the problem's requirement to alternate between addition and subtraction.

2. **Handling of Even and Odd Lengths**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to handle different cases based on `n % 4`, but the logic for generating the coefficients is flawed. For example, when `n % 4 == 0`, it generates coefficients in pairs `[e, -e]`, but this does not correctly represent the alternating pattern for all cases.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The main part of the code uses the coefficients generated by `func_2` to compute the final result. However, since the coefficients themselves are incorrect, the final result will also be incorrect.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
3 6 9 12 15
```
According to the problem description, the operations should be:
```
First row:  3  6  9 12 15
Second row:  9  3 21  3
Third row:  6 -18 18
Fourth row: -12  36
Fifth row:  48
```
The final result should be `48 % (10^9 + 7) = 48`.

However, the provided code will produce a different result because the coefficients generated by `func_2` do not correctly represent the alternating addition and subtraction pattern.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the alternating addition and subtraction as required by the problem statement, leading to incorrect results for many inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
