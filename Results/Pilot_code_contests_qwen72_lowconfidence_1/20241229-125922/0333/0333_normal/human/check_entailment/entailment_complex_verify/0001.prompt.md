You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Karen has just arrived at school, and she has a math test today!

<image>

The test is about basic addition and subtraction. Unfortunately, the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds, and had no time to make an actual test. So, they just put one question in the test that is worth all the points.

There are n integers written on a row. Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains. The first operation should be addition.

Note that, if she ended the previous row by adding the integers, she should start the next row by subtracting, and vice versa.

The teachers will simply look at the last integer, and then if it is correct, Karen gets a perfect score, otherwise, she gets a zero for the test.

Karen has studied well for this test, but she is scared that she might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer to be wrong. If the process is followed, what number can she expect to be written on the last row?

Since this number can be quite large, output only the non-negative remainder after dividing it by 109 + 7.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), the number of numbers written on the first row.

The next line contains n integers. Specifically, the i-th one among these is ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), the i-th number on the first row.

Output

Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number on the final row after performing the process above.

Since this number can be quite large, print only the non-negative remainder after dividing it by 109 + 7.

Examples

Input

5
3 6 9 12 15


Output

36


Input

4
3 7 5 2


Output

1000000006

Note

In the first test case, the numbers written on the first row are 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15.

Karen performs the operations as follows:

<image>

The non-negative remainder after dividing the final number by 109 + 7 is still 36, so this is the correct output.

In the second test case, the numbers written on the first row are 3, 7, 5 and 2.

Karen performs the operations as follows:

<image>

The non-negative remainder after dividing the final number by 109 + 7 is 109 + 6, so this is the correct output.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    l = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        l[i + 1] = l[i] * (n - i) * pow(i + 1, p - 2, p) % p
    return l

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, p):
    l = []
    if n % 4 == 0:
        for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
            l += [e, -e]
        return l
    if n % 4 == 1:
        for e in func_1(n // 2, p):
            l += [e, 0]
        l.pop(-1)
        return l
    if n % 4 == 2:
        for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
            l += [e, e]
        return l
    pre_l = []
    for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
        pre_l += [e, e]
    l.append(pre_l[0])
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        l.append(pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1))
    l.append(pre_l[n - 2] * (-1) ** n)
    return l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not directly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be generating some coefficients, but they do not perform the alternating addition and subtraction operations on the input list as required by the problem description. The program lacks the main logic to handle the input and perform the specified operations to produce the final result. Therefore, the program is incorrect. 

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

For input:
```
5
3 6 9 12 15
```

The expected output is `36`, but the provided functions do not perform the necessary operations to achieve this result. They generate coefficients that are not used in the context of the problem's requirements. Thus, the program fails to meet the problem's specifications.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    s = func_2(n, 10 ** 9 + 7)
    t = 0
    l = map(lambda x: int(x), raw_input().split(' '))
    for i in range(n):
        t += s[i] * l[i]
        t %= 10 ** 9 + 7
    print(str(t))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the initial row, and p is a positive integer used as the modulus for the calculations, where p is typically set to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, p):
    l = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        l[i + 1] = l[i] * (n - i) * pow(i + 1, p - 2, p) % p
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as follows: `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`.
    return l
    #The program returns a list `l` of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `p` is a positive integer (typically \(10^9 + 7\)). It returns a list `l` of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning `[1]`. However, the function does not handle the case where `p` is not a prime number, which could lead to incorrect results due to the use of modular inverses (`pow(i, p - 2, p)`). Additionally, the function assumes that `p` is a prime number for the modular inverse to work correctly.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
