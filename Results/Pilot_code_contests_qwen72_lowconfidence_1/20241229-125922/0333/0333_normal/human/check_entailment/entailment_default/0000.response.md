Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `p` is not a prime number correctly. The function `func_1` uses the modular inverse (`pow(i, p - 2, p)`) which is only valid if `p` is a prime number. If `p` is not a prime, the modular inverse may not exist, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, the problem description specifies that the final result should be the non-negative remainder after dividing by \(10^9 + 7\), which is a prime number, but the program does not explicitly check or enforce this condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect for cases where `p` is not a prime number.
