You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Karen has just arrived at school, and she has a math test today!

<image>

The test is about basic addition and subtraction. Unfortunately, the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds, and had no time to make an actual test. So, they just put one question in the test that is worth all the points.

There are n integers written on a row. Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains. The first operation should be addition.

Note that, if she ended the previous row by adding the integers, she should start the next row by subtracting, and vice versa.

The teachers will simply look at the last integer, and then if it is correct, Karen gets a perfect score, otherwise, she gets a zero for the test.

Karen has studied well for this test, but she is scared that she might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer to be wrong. If the process is followed, what number can she expect to be written on the last row?

Since this number can be quite large, output only the non-negative remainder after dividing it by 109 + 7.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), the number of numbers written on the first row.

The next line contains n integers. Specifically, the i-th one among these is ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), the i-th number on the first row.

Output

Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number on the final row after performing the process above.

Since this number can be quite large, print only the non-negative remainder after dividing it by 109 + 7.

Examples

Input

5
3 6 9 12 15


Output

36


Input

4
3 7 5 2


Output

1000000006

Note

In the first test case, the numbers written on the first row are 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15.

Karen performs the operations as follows:

<image>

The non-negative remainder after dividing the final number by 109 + 7 is still 36, so this is the correct output.

In the second test case, the numbers written on the first row are 3, 7, 5 and 2.

Karen performs the operations as follows:

<image>

The non-negative remainder after dividing the final number by 109 + 7 is 109 + 6, so this is the correct output.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements in the initial row, and p is a positive integer used as the modulus for the calculations, where p is typically set to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n, p):
    l = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        l[i + 1] = l[i] * (n - i) * pow(i + 1, p - 2, p) % p
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as follows: `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`.
    return l
    #The program returns a list `l` of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `p` is a positive integer (typically \(10^9 + 7\)). It returns a list `l` of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning `[1]`. However, the function does not handle the case where `p` is not a prime number, which could lead to incorrect results due to the use of modular inverses (`pow(i, p - 2, p)`). Additionally, the function assumes that `p` is a prime number for the modular inverse to work correctly.

I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
