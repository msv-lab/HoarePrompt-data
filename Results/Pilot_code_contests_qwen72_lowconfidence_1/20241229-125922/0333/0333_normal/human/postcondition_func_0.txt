The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `p` is a positive integer (typically \(10^9 + 7\)). It returns a list `l` of length `n + 1` where `l[0]` is 1, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `l[i]` is calculated as `l[i] = ((...((n % p) * (n - 1) * pow(2, p - 2, p) % p) * (n - 2) * pow(3, p - 2, p) % p)...) * (n - (i - 1)) * pow(i, p - 2, p) % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, returning `[1]`. However, the function does not handle the case where `p` is not a prime number, which could lead to incorrect results due to the use of modular inverses (`pow(i, p - 2, p)`). Additionally, the function assumes that `p` is a prime number for the modular inverse to work correctly.
