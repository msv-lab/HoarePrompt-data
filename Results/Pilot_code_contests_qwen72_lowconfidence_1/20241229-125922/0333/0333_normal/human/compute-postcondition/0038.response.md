The code snippet `pre_l += [e, e]` appends two elements, both `e`, to the list `pre_l`. The value of `e` is not specified in the initial state, but the structure of `pre_l` changes from `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e]` to `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e, e, e]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e, e, e]`, where `new_e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e, e, e]`, where `new_e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
