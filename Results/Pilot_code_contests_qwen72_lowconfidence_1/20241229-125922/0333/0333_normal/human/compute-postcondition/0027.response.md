To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
   - `n % 4` is 2
   - `p` is 10^9 + 7
   - `l` is a list containing `[e, e, e, e]`
   - `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` is called with the arguments `n // 2 - 1` and `p`.
   - Since `n % 4` is 2, we can express `n` as `n = 4k + 2` for some integer `k`.
   - Therefore, `n // 2 - 1` simplifies to `(4k + 2) // 2 - 1 = 2k + 1 - 1 = 2k`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(2k, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.
   - The state `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The state `p` remains the same because it is a constant.
   - The state `l` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The state `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `func_1` must still return an iterable with at least one more element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n % 4` is 2, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is a list containing `[e, e, e, e]`, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element**
