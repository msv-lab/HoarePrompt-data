The code snippet `l += [e, e]` appends two elements `e` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `[e, e]`, so after the execution, `l` will contain `[e, e, e, e]`.

The initial state provides:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `n % 4` is 2
- `p` is 10^9 + 7
- `l` is a list containing `[e, e]`
- `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `n % 4` is 2
- `p` is 10^9 + 7
- `l` is a list containing `[e, e, e, e]`
- `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n % 4` is 2, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is a list containing `[e, e, e, e]`, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element**
