To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
   - `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7)
   - `l` is an empty list
   - `n % 4` is equal to 1

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for e in func_1(n // 2, p):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element.
   - The initial state does not provide information about what `func_1` returns, but we need to assume that `func_1` returns an iterable.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `func_1(n // 2, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and `n % 4 == 1`, `n // 2` will be a positive integer.
   - The variable `e` will take the first value from the iterable returned by `func_1`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element. However, since we don't have the implementation of `func_1`, we can only assume that it will return such an iterable based on the given inputs.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, and `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element**.
