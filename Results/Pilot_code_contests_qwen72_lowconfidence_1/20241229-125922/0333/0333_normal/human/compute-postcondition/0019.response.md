The code `l.pop(-1)` removes the last element from the list `l`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1.
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is a list of `2m` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

After executing `l.pop(-1)`, the last element of `l` is removed. Since `l` is initially a list of pairs `[e, 0]`, removing the last element means that `l` now has one fewer pair. Specifically, `l` will have `2m - 2` elements, and the last element `[e, 0]` will be removed.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1.
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is a list of `2m - 2` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list of `2m - 2` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.**
