To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4.
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is `[e, -e]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer and divisible by 4.
   - `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
   - `l` is `[e, -e]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
   - The variable `e` takes on each value from this iterable.

3. **State After One Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `e` has taken the first value from the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
   - The next iteration will use the second value from the iterable.

4. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to reflect that the iterable `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` has at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.
- The variable `e` will take the second value from the iterable.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e]` where `e` is the second element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**.
