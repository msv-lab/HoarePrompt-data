To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and requirements based on the given information:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 1
- The current value of `n % 4` is 2

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The loop iterates over the values returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer and `n % 4 == 2`.
   - `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
   - `l` is an empty list.

2. **Function Argument**:
   - `n // 2 - 1` must be a valid argument for `func_1`.
   - Since `n % 4 == 2`, we can express `n` as `n = 4k + 2` for some integer `k`.
   - Therefore, `n // 2 = (4k + 2) // 2 = 2k + 1`.
   - Thus, `n // 2 - 1 = 2k`.

3. **Function Behavior**:
   - `func_1(2k, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure that `func_1(2k, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element.
   - Since `n` is already constrained to be a positive integer and `n % 4 == 2`, no further adjustments to `n` or `p` are needed.
   - The list `l` being empty does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it should remain empty unless modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `func_1(2k, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element. Given the constraints, the state remains as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n % 4` is 2, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is an empty list, and `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element.**
