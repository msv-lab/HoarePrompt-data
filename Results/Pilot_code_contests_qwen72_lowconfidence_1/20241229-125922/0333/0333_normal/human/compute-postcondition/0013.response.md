The code snippet `l += [e, 0]` appends the elements `e` and `0` to the list `l`. The variable `e` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be an element from the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`. Since `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element, `e` represents the first element of this iterable.

Therefore, the list `l` now contains two elements: the first element `e` from the iterable and `0`.

The values of `n`, `p`, and the condition `n % 4 == 1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`**.
