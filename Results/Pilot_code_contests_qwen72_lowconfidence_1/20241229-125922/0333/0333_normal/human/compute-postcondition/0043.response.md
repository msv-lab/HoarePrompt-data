To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l` and the new element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`.
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2.
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n - 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be incremented to 2.
- The other states (`n`, `p`, `l`, `pre_l`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop condition itself.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l` and the new element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 2**
