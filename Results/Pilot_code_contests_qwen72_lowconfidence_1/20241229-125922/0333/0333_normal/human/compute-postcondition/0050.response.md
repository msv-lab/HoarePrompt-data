The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value, specifically 10^9 + 7. The function returns different lists based on the conditions specified:

- **Case_1**: If `n` is divisible by 4, the function returns a list `l` containing pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. The length of `l` is twice the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

- **Case_2**: If `n` is not divisible by 4, the function returns a list `l` of `2m - 2` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

- **Case_3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function returns a list `l` containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the number of elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. If `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

- **Case_4**: If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns the list `l` containing `n` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]`, each subsequent element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`, and the last element is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1)`. The length of the list `l` is `n`, and the list is generated based on the provided formula using the initial values from `pre_l`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7). It returns a list `l` based on the following cases:**

- **Case_1**: If `n` is divisible by 4, it returns a list containing pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
- **Case_2**: If `n` is not divisible by 4, it returns a list of `2m - 2` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements is `[e, 0]`.
- **Case_3**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it returns a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the number of elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
- **Case_4**: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns a list `l` containing `n` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]`, each subsequent element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`, and the last element is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1)`.
