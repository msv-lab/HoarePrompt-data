The list `l` initially contains two elements: `[next_e, 0]`. The code snippet `l += [e, 0]` appends the list `[e, 0]` to `l`. Therefore, `l` now contains four elements: `[next_e, 0, e, 0]`.

The values of `n`, `p`, and the condition that `n % 4 == 1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is `[next_e, 0, e, 0]` where `next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`**
