The code snippet `pre_l += [e, e]` appends two elements, both `e`, to the list `pre_l`. Since the initial state specifies that `pre_l` is an empty list, after executing the code, `pre_l` will contain `[e, e]`.

Other variables (`n`, `p`, `l`) and conditions (`n % 4` is not equal to 2) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[e, e]`**
