The code snippet appends a new element to the list `l`. This new element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l` and the new element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`
- `i` is 2

The calculation for the new element to be appended to `l` is:
- `pre_l[i]` is `pre_l[2]`
- `pre_l[i - 1]` is `pre_l[1]`
- `(-1) ** (i + 1)` is `(-1) ** 3` which is `-1`

So, the new element to be appended is `pre_l[2] + pre_l[1] * (-1)`, which simplifies to `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`.

Thus, the new state of the list `l` is `l` with an additional element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`.

The variable `i` remains 2, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, the element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, and the new element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 2**
