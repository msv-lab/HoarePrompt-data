The code snippet appends a new element to the list `l`. This new element is calculated as `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1) ** n`.

- `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000.
- `p` remains a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- The list `l` initially contains `n - 1` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]` and the subsequent elements follow the pattern `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`.
- After appending the new element, `l` now contains `n` elements.

The new element added to `l` is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1) ** n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is `pre_l[0]` and the subsequent elements are `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`, and the last element is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1) ** n`.**
