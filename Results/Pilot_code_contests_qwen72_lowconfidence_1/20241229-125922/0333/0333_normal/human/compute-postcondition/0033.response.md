To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over elements returned by the function `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. For the loop to execute, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element.

Let's break down the given state and the loop:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is an empty list

### Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The loop depends on the result of `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
2. **Iterable Condition**: For the loop to execute, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element.
3. **Input to `func_1`**:
   - `n // 2 - 1` must be a non-negative integer for `func_1` to potentially return a non-empty iterable.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `n // 2` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, `n // 2 - 1` will be non-negative if `n >= 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is at least 2 so that `n // 2 - 1` is non-negative.
- The state of `l` and `pre_l` being empty lists does not affect the execution of the loop directly.
- The condition `n % 4 != 2` is already given and does not need adjustment.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is an empty list**
