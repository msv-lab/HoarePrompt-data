To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is `[e, e, e, e]`, where `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**: This function generates a sequence of values. The loop iterates over these values.
2. **`e`**: The current value from the sequence generated by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
3. **`pre_l`**: The list `pre_l` is initialized as `[e, e, e, e]`, where `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `pre_l` is `[e, e, e, e]`, where `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
- **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the generator `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must yield another value.
- **Adjustments**:
  - `e` will be updated to the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
  - `pre_l` will be updated to reflect the new value of `e`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` remains the same (10^9 + 7)
- `l` remains an empty list
- `n % 4` is still not equal to 2
- `pre_l` will be updated to `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e]`, where `new_e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[new_e, new_e, new_e, new_e]`, where `new_e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
