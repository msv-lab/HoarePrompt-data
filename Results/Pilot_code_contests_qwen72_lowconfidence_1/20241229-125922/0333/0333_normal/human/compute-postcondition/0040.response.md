The code snippet `l.append(pre_l[0])` adds the first element of `pre_l` to the list `l`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`

After executing the code snippet:

- The first element of `pre_l` is added to `l`
- `l` now contains one element, which is the first element of `pre_l`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.**
