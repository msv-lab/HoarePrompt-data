To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over elements returned by the function `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. For the loop to execute, this function must return an iterable with at least one element.

Let's break down the state and the loop:

1. **State before the loop:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
   - `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7)
   - `l` is an empty list
   - `n` is divisible by 4

2. **Loop condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element.

3. **Adjustments needed:**
   - The function `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return a non-empty iterable.
   - Since `n` is divisible by 4, `n // 2 - 1` will be a non-negative integer. This ensures that the function call is valid.

Given these points, the state needs to ensure that `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns a non-empty iterable. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `func_1` must return at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element**
