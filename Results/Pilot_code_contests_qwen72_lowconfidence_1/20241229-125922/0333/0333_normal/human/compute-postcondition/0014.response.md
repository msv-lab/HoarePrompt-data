To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. **`func_1(n // 2, p)`**: This function returns an iterable. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `e` will be updated to the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.
   - `l` will be updated to `[next_e, 0]` where `next_e` is the next element in the iterable.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4` is equal to 1.
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `e` should be the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.
- `l` should be updated to `[next_e, 0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is `[next_e, 0]` where `next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`**.
