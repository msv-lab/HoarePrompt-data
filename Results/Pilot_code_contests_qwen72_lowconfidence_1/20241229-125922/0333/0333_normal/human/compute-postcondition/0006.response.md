To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4.
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is `[e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the second element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Iterable Source**: The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `e` is the current element being processed from the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must be available.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`e`**: The value of `e` needs to be updated to the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
- **`l`**: The list `l` remains unchanged because it is defined based on the current value of `e` from the iterable.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4.
- `p` remains a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` remains `[e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the next element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
