The code snippet appends two elements, `e` and `-e`, to the list `l`. The original list `l` was `[e, -e, e, -e]`, and after appending, the new list `l` becomes `[e, -e, e, -e, e, -e]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e, e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the next element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e, e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the next element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
