To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `n % 4` is 2
- `p` is 10^9 + 7
- `l` is a list containing `[e, e]`
- `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element

### Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n % 4` is 2, so `n` can be written as `n = 4k + 2` for some integer `k`.
   - `n // 2 - 1` simplifies to `(4k + 2) // 2 - 1 = 2k + 1 - 1 = 2k`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` is called with arguments `2k` and `p`.
   - This function must return an iterable with at least one element.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `e` returned by `func_1(2k, p)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(2k, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.

### Adjusted State:
- The state does not change in terms of `n`, `p`, or the list `l` because these are not modified within the loop.
- The only thing that changes is the state of the iterable returned by `func_1(2k, p)`, which must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
The state remains the same except for the assumption that `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n % 4` is 2, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is a list containing `[e, e]`, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element**.
