To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, the element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, and the new element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`.
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2.
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the new value of `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, the element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, and the new element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3**
