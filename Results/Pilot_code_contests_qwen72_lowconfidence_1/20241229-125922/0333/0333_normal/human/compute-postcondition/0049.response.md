Output State: **The program returns the list `l` containing `n` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]`, each subsequent element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`, and the last element is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1)`. The length of the list `l` is `n`, and the list is generated based on the provided formula using the initial values from `pre_l`.**
