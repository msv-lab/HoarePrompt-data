The code snippet `l += [e, -e]` appends two elements to the list `l`: the value of `e` and its negation `-e`. Since `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element, `e` is the first element from this iterable.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element

After executing the code:
- `l` is now `[e, -e]`, where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`
- The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e]` where `e` is the first element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
