To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the loop code provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4.
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    l += [e, -e]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Call**: The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
2. **List Appending**: For each element `e` returned by `func_1`, the loop appends `[e, -e]` to the list `l`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4.
- **`p`**: Remains a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- **`l`**: After the loop finishes, `l` will contain pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. The length of `l` will be twice the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Detailed Output State:
- If `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable of length `m`, then `l` will have a length of `2 * m`.
- Each pair `[e, -e]` in `l` corresponds to an element `e` from the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and the length of `l` is twice the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.**
