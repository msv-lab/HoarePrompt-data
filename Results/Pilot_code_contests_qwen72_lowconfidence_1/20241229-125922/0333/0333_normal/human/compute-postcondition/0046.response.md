The code appends a new element to the list `l`. This new element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so the calculation is:

- `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2] * (-1) ** (3 + 1)`
- `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2] * (-1) ** 4`
- `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2] * 1`
- `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2]`

Therefore, the new element appended to `l` is `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2]`.

The updated state of the variables is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, the element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, the new element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`, and the newly appended element `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2]`
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`
- `i` is 3
- `n - 1` must be greater than 3

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, the element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, the new element `pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]`, and the newly appended element `pre_l[3] + pre_l[2]`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3**
