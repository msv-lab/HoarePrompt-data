To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code and the provided initial and intermediate states step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    l.append(pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1))
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop appends a new element to `l` calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)`.

### Intermediate States:
- After 1 iteration: `l` contains `[pre_l[0], pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]]`
- After 2 iterations: `l` contains `[pre_l[0], pre_l[1] + pre_l[0], pre_l[2] - pre_l[1]]`
- After 3 iterations: `l` contains `[pre_l[0], pre_l[1] + pre_l[0], pre_l[2] - pre_l[1], pre_l[3] + pre_l[2]]`

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute `n - 2` times because it runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`.
- After `n - 2` iterations, `l` will contain `n - 1` elements.
- The elements of `l` will be:
  - The first element is `pre_l[0]`.
  - The subsequent elements are calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `n - 2`.

### Summary of the Final Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is a list containing `n - 1` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]` and the subsequent elements are `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `n - 2`.
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing `n - 1` elements where the first element is `pre_l[0]` and the subsequent elements are `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)` for `i` from 1 to `n - 2`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.**
