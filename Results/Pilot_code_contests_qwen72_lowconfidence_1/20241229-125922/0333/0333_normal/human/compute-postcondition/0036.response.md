The code `pre_l += [e, e]` extends the list `pre_l` by appending two more elements, both of which are `e`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is `[e, e]`
- `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`

After executing the code, the updated state is:

- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is `[e, e, e, e]`
- `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[e, e, e, e]`, `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
