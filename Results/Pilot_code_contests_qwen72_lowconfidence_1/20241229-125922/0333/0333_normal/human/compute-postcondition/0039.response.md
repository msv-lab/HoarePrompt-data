To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is an empty list

### Loop Code:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2 - 1, p):
    pre_l += [e, e]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop iterates over the values returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. For each value `e` returned by `func_1`, the list `pre_l` is extended by `[e, e]`.

2. **Number of Iterations**: The number of iterations depends on the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. Let's denote this length by `m`.

3. **Effect on Variables**:
   - `n`: Remains unchanged.
   - `p`: Remains unchanged.
   - `l`: Remains an empty list.
   - `pre_l`: After `m` iterations, `pre_l` will contain `2 * m` elements, where each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is an empty list
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.**
