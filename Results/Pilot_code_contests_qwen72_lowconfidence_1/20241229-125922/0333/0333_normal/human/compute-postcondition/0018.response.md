To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided loop and the conditions under which it operates:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1.
- `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is an empty list.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2, p):
    l += [e, 0]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Iteration Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `e` returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.
2. **Effect of Each Iteration**: For each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, the list `l` is extended by appending `[e, 0]`.

### Key Points:
- The function `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable. The length of this iterable determines how many times the loop will execute.
- Since `n % 4 == 1`, `n` is of the form `4k + 1` for some integer `k`. Therefore, `n // 2` is an integer of the form `2k`.
- The length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)` is determined by the implementation of `func_1`, but we can assume it returns a sequence of elements based on `n // 2`.

### Final Output State:
- If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable of length `m`, the loop will execute `m` times.
- After `m` iterations, the list `l` will contain `2m` elements, where each pair of elements is `[e, 0]` for each `e` in the iterable.

### Conclusion:
- If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an iterable of length `m`, the final state of the list `l` will be a list of `2m` elements, where every odd-indexed element is an element from the iterable and every even-indexed element is `0`.
- If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, the loop will not execute, and `l` will remain an empty list.

### Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) such that `n % 4` is equal to 1, `p` is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list of `2m` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.**
