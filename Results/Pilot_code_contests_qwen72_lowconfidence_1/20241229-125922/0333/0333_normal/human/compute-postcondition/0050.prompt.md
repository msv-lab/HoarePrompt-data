You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), p is a positive integer representing the modulo value (10^9 + 7).
```
def func_2(n, p):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns a list `l` containing pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. The length of `l` is twice the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, and `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).

Case_2: The program returns a list `l` of `2m - 2` elements where `m` is the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`, and each pair of elements in `l` is `[e, 0]` where `e` is an element from the iterable. If `func_1(n // 2, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

Case_3: The program returns a list `l` containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the number of elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. If `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an empty iterable, `l` remains an empty list.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` containing `n` elements, where the first element is `pre_l[0]`, each subsequent element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1)`, and the last element is `pre_l[n - 2] * (-1)`. The length of the list `l` is `n`, and the list is generated based on the provided formula using the initial values from `pre_l`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
