Output State: **The program returns a list `l` containing pairs `[e, -e]` for each element `e` in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. The length of `l` is twice the length of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, and `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).**
