To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7)
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` will execute if the range `1` to `n - 1` (exclusive) contains at least one value. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n - 1 > 1` implies `n > 2`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 1.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`p`, `l`, `pre_l`, and the condition `n % 4 != 2`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. However, they should remain as they are because they are part of the program's state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is greater than 2. The other conditions remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 1**
