The list `l` initially contains two elements `[e, -e]`, where `e` is the second element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. The code snippet `l += [e, -e]` appends the elements `[e, -e]` to the list `l`.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the list `l` will contain four elements: `[e, -e, e, -e]`.

The other variables (`n`, `p`) and their properties remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and divisible by 4, `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is `[e, -e, e, -e]` where `e` is the second element of the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
