The code appends a new element to the list `l`. This element is calculated as `pre_l[i] + pre_l[i - 1] * (-1) ** (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, let's break down the calculation:

- `i` is 1.
- `pre_l` contains `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
- Each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.

For `i = 1`:
- `pre_l[1]` is the second element of `pre_l`.
- `pre_l[0]` is the first element of `pre_l`.
- `(-1) ** (i + 1) = (-1) ** 2 = 1`.

Thus, the new element appended to `l` is `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0] * 1 = pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
- `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
- `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l` and the new element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`.
- `n % 4` is not equal to 2.
- `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is a list containing the first element of `pre_l` and the new element `pre_l[1] + pre_l[0]`, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is a list containing `2 * m` elements, where `m` is the length of the sequence returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, and each element `e` from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` appears twice in `pre_l`, `i` is 1.**
