To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the sequence generated by `func_1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
   - `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7).
   - `l` is an empty list.
   - `n % 4` is not equal to 2.
   - `pre_l` is `[e, e]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `e` will take the next value from the sequence generated by `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`.
   - The state of `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the given context.

Given that the loop is iterating over the results of `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`, the key factor is whether `func_1` generates another element. Since we don't have the implementation details of `func_1`, we assume it continues to generate elements based on the input parameters.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next state should reflect the next value of `e` being taken from the sequence generated by `func_1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `p` is a positive integer (10^9 + 7), `l` is an empty list, `n % 4` is not equal to 2, `pre_l` is `[e, e]`, `e` is the next value from `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)`**
