The list `l` is extended by appending the elements `[e, 0]`. The initial state specifies that `l` is `[new_next_e, 0, next_e, 0]`, where `new_next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`. After the code executes, the new elements `[e, 0]` are appended to `l`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`, `p` is `10^9 + 7`, `l` is `[new_next_e, 0, next_e, 0, e, 0]` where `new_next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`, `p` is `10^9 + 7`, `l` is `[new_next_e, 0, next_e, 0, e, 0]` where `new_next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`**
