The code snippet `l += [e, e]` modifies the list `l` by appending two elements, both equal to `e`. This operation does not affect the variables `n`, `p`, or the requirement for `func_1` to return an iterable with at least one more element. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(2k, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.
- The state `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
- The state `p` remains the same because it is a constant.
- The state `l` is now `l` with two additional elements, both equal to `e`.
- The state `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.

Output State: **For the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(2k, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element. `n` remains the same. `p` remains the same. `l` is now `l` with two additional elements, both equal to `e`. `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one more element.**
