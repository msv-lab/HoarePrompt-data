To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`.
- `p` is `10^9 + 7`.
- `l` is `[next_e, 0, e, 0]` where `next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for e in func_1(n // 2, p):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Iterable Source**: The loop iterates over the elements returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`.
   - `p` is `10^9 + 7`.
   - `l` is `[next_e, 0, e, 0]` where `next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Next Element in Iterable**:
   - The current value of `e` is the element from the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the iterable must be available.
   - This means `func_1(n // 2, p)` must return at least one more element.

2. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The value of `n` and `p` remain unchanged as they are parameters passed to `func_1`.
   - The list `l` needs to be updated to reflect the next element in the iterable.
   - Specifically, `next_e` will become the new `e` for the next iteration, and the new `next_e` will be the next element in the iterable.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`.
- `p` remains `10^9 + 7`.
- `l` is updated to `[new_next_e, 0, next_e, 0]` where `new_next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n % 4 == 1`, `p` is `10^9 + 7`, `l` is `[new_next_e, 0, next_e, 0]` where `new_next_e` is the next element in the iterable returned by `func_1(n // 2, p)`**
