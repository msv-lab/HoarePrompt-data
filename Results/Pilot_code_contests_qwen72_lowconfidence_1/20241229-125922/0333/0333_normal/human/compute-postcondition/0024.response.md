The code snippet `l += [e, e]` appends two elements, both equal to `e`, to the list `l`. Since `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` returns an iterable with at least one element, and assuming `e` is the first element from this iterable, the list `l` will now contain two instances of `e`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000)
- `n % 4` is 2
- `p` is 10^9 + 7
- `l` is a list containing `[e, e]`
- `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n % 4` is 2, `p` is 10^9 + 7, `l` is a list containing `[e, e]`, `func_1(n // 2 - 1, p)` must return an iterable with at least one element.**
