Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GB' or 'BB' depending on the initial value of `s`. If `b` < `a`, then `c` is 0 and `d` is toggled from its initial value. Otherwise, `c` remains `c + 1` and `d` is unchanged.***
