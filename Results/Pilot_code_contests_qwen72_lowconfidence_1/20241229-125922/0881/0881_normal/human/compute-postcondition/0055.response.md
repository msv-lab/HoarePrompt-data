The `quit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further execution of the code occurs, and no changes are made to the variables after this point.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` depending on the new condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the new condition of `d`, `c` is 0, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition, and `d` is the opposite of its previous value if `a < b`. The program has terminated.**
