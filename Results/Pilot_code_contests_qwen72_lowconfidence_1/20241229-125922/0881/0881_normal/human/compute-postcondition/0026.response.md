The value of `b` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b` was `vals[3]`, so the new value of `b` is `vals[3] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 0, `s` is `'B'`, `d` is `False`.**
