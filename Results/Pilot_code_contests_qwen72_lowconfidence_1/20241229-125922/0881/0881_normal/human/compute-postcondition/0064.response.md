The code snippet `d = not d` changes the value of `d` to its logical opposite. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `d`, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. However, we know that after executing this line, `d` will be the opposite of what it was before.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 3` or `vals[2] - 2` (or possibly updated), `s` is 'GGG' or 'BGG', `c` is 1, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition. If `c == k`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
