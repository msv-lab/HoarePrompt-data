The code snippet sets the variable `d` to `False`. This changes the value of `d` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `False`, and `b` is greater than `a`**
