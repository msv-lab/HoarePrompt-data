The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `c` is 0. After incrementing `c` by 1, the new value of `c` is 1.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `d`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 1, `s` is 'G', the current value of `d` is `True`.**
