Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `s` is '', `d` is the opposite of its initial value (if initially `b` > `a`, then `d` is now `True`; otherwise, `d` is now `False`).**
