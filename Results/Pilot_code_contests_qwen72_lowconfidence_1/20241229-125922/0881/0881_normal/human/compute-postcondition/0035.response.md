The `quit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means no further changes occur to the variables, and the program ends. The values of the variables remain as they were before the `quit()` call, except for the fact that the program's execution stops.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions described, and the program has terminated.**
