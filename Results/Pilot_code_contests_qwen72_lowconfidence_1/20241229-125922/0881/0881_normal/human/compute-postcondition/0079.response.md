The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints and the typical structure of Python functions, we can infer that the function should accept four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are integers with the following constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n.

Given the constraints and the typical behavior of functions, the function likely returns a result based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

However, since the output is not specified in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and the expected constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers. The parameters satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n.**
