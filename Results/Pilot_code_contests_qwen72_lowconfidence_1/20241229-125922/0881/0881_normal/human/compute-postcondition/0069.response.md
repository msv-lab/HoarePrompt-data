The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Let's list the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result:

- `c` was initially 0.
- After executing `c += 1`, the new value of `c` is 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` (or possibly updated), `s` is either 'GGB' or 'BGB', `c` is 1, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition. If `c == k`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
