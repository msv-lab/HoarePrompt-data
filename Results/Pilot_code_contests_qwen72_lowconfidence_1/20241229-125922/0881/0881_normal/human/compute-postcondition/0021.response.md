The value of `d` is toggled from its current value. Since the current value of `d` is `True`, after executing `d = not d`, `d` becomes `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 1, `s` is 'G', the current value of `d` is `False`, and the current value of `a` is less than the current value of `b`**
