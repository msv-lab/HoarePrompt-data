The code snippet `s += 'B'` appends the character 'B' to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty string (`''`). After executing the code, `s` becomes `'B'`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `s` is `'B'`, `d` is `False`.**
