The code snippet `a -= 1` decrements the value of `a` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `a` is `vals[2]`. After decrementing `a` by 1, the new value of `a` is `vals[2] - 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `c`, `s`, and `d`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2] - 1`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `s` is 'G', the current value of `d` is `True`.**
