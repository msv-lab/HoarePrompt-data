The code snippet `s += 'G'` appends the character 'G' to the string `s`. The initial value of `s` is an empty string (`''`), so after appending 'G', `s` becomes `'G'`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `s` is 'G', the current value of `d` is `True`.**
