The value of `a` is updated to `vals[2]`. The other conditions remain unchanged. Since `a` was previously defined as part of the condition `a + b = vals[0]`, this relationship may no longer hold true depending on the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, and `k` is `vals[1]`**
