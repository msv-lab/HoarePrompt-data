To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step, considering the initial state and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `n` is `vals[0]`
- 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105
- `a` is `vals[2]`
- 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`
- `k` is `vals[1]`
- `b` is `vals[3]`
- `c` is 0
- `s` is ''
- If `b` > `a`, then `d` is `False`. Otherwise, `d` remains `True`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    if c == k:
        d = not d
        c = 0
    if d:
        s += 'G'
        a -= 1
        c += 1
        if a < b:
            d = not d
            c = 0
    else:
        s += 'B'
        b -= 1
        c += 1
        if b < a:
            d = not d
            c = 0
    if a < 0 or b < 0:
        print('NO')
        quit()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the total number of iterations.
   - `k` is the threshold for resetting `c` and toggling `d`.
   - `a` and `b` are the initial counts of 'G' and 'B' respectively.
   - `c` is a counter that resets every `k` iterations.
   - `s` is the string being built.
   - `d` determines whether to append 'G' or 'B' to `s`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - `c` increments with each iteration and resets to 0 when it reaches `k`, toggling `d`.
   - Depending on the value of `d`, either 'G' or 'B' is appended to `s`.
   - `a` and `b` are decremented accordingly.
   - If `a` or `b` becomes negative, the program terminates with 'NO'.

3. **Final State**:
   - After `n` iterations, `s` will be a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'B'.
   - `a` and `b` will be the remaining counts of 'G' and 'B' respectively.
   - `c` will be the number of iterations since the last reset, ranging from 0 to `k-1`.
   - `d` will be the final state of the toggle, which depends on the initial values and the number of iterations.
   - If the loop completes without `a` or `b` becoming negative, `s` will be a valid sequence.

### Output State:
- `n` is `vals[0]` (unchanged).
- `k` is `vals[1]` (unchanged).
- `a` is the remaining count of 'G' after `n` iterations, which is `vals[2] - (number of 'G' in s)`.
- `b` is the remaining count of 'B' after `n` iterations, which is `vals[3] - (number of 'B' in s)`.
- `c` is the number of iterations since the last reset, ranging from 0 to `k-1`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'B'.
- `d` is the final state of the toggle, which depends on the initial values and the number of iterations.
- If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated with 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `a` is `vals[2] - (number of 'G' in s)`, `b` is `vals[3] - (number of 'B' in s)`, `c` is between 0 and `k-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'B', `d` is the final state of the toggle, and if `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated with 'NO'.**
