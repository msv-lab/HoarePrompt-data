The `quit()` function immediately terminates the program execution. No further changes occur to any variables, and no additional code is executed after this point. Therefore, the output state retains all the preconditions that were valid before the `quit()` call.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 3` or `vals[2] - 2` (or possibly updated). If `d` is true, `s` is 'GGG' or 'BGG', and if `a < b`, `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is 1. If `d` is false, `s` is 'GGB' or 'BGB', and `c` is 1. In both cases, if `b < a` or `a < b`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition. If `c == k`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
