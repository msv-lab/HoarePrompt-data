The code snippet `s += 'G'` appends the character 'G' to the string `s`. Given the initial state, the value of `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG'. After appending 'G', the value of `s` will be 'GGG' if it was 'GG', or 'BGG' if it was 'BG'.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `c`) and conditions (`a < 0 or b < 0`, `c == k`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` (or possibly updated), `s` is 'GGG' or 'BGG', `c` is 0, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition. If `c == k`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
