The code `s += 'G'` appends the character 'G' to the string `s`.

- `s` is originally either 'G' or 'B'.
- After the operation, `s` will be 'GG' if it was originally 'G', or 'BG' if it was originally 'B'.

All other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `d`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the condition of `d`. If `c == k`, `d` is now the opposite of its previous value, and `c` is set to 0. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.**
