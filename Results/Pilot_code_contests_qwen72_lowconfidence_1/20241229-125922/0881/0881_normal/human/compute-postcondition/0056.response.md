Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` depending on the new condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the new condition of `d`, `c` is 0, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition, and `d` is the opposite of its previous value if `a < b`. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `c`, and `d` as specified.***
