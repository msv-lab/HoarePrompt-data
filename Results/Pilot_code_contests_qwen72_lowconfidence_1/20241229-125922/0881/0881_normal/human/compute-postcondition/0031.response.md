Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`. If `b` < `a`, `c` is 0, `s` is `'B'`, and `d` is `True`. Otherwise, `c` remains 1, `s` remains `'B'`, and `d` remains `False`.***
