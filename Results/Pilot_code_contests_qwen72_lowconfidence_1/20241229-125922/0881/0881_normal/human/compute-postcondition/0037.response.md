To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105.
- `k` is `vals[1]`.
- `b` is `vals[3]`.
- `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`.
- `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition of `d`.
- `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`.
- `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions described.
- If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
- **Check `n`**: `n` remains `vals[0]` and must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `s`, `d`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions described. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.**
