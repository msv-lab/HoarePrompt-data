The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `d`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `d` is `True`**
