The code snippet `d = not d` toggles the boolean value of the variable `d`. Since the initial state specifies that `d` is `False`, after executing this code, `d` will become `True`.

Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged from the initial state, except for the updated value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `c` is 1, `s` is `'B'`, `d` is `True`. Additionally, the current value of `b` is less than `a`.**
