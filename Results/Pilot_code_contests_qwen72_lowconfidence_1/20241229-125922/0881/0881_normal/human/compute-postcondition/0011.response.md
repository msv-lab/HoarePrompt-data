To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is `vals[0]`
- 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105
- `a` is `vals[2]`
- 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`
- `k` is `vals[1]`
- `b` is `vals[3]`
- `c` is 0
- `s` is ''
- If `b` > `a`, then `d` is `False`. Otherwise, `d` remains `True`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0, `s` is '', If `b` > `a`, then `d` is `False`. Otherwise, `d` remains `True`.**
