The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of the new value for `c`.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]`, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `a` is `vals[2]`, 0 ≤ `b` ≤ `vals[0]`, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `c` is 0**
