The value of `c` is set to 0, which does not change from its initial state. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` (or possibly updated), `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' (depending on the new condition of `d`), `c` is 0, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition, and `d` is the opposite of its previous value.**
