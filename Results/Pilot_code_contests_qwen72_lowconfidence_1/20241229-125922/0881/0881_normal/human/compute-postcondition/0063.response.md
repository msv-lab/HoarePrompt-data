The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial state provides that `c` is 0. After incrementing `c` by 1, the new value of `c` will be 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]` (or possibly updated), `a` is either `vals[2] - 3` or `vals[2] - 2` (or possibly updated), `s` is 'GGG' or 'BGG', `c` is 1, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition. If `c == k`, `d` is the opposite of its previous value. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
