Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`, `d` is either `True` or `False` depending on the conditions described. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.***
