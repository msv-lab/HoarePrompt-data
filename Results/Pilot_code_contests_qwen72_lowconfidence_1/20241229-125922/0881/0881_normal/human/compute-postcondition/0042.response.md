The value of `a` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the condition of `d`. If `c == k`, `d` is now the opposite of its previous value, and `c` is set to 0. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.**
