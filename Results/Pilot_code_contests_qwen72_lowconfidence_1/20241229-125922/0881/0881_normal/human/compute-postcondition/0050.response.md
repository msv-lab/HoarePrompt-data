The value of `d` is toggled from its current state (if it was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3] - 1`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GB' or 'BB' depending on the initial value of `s`, `c` is `c + 1`, `d` is toggled from its initial value.**
