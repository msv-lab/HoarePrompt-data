The value of `d` is toggled (changed from `True` to `False` or from `False` to `True`). The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`, `d` is now the opposite of its previous value.**
