The code snippet `s += 'B'` appends the character 'B' to the string `s`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged.

- `s` was initially either 'G' or 'B', depending on the condition of `d`.
- After appending 'B', `s` will be either 'GB' or 'BB'.

The output state reflects this change in `s` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GB' or 'BB' depending on the initial value of `s`, `c` is as it was, `d` is as it was. If `c == k`, `d` is now the opposite of its previous value, and `c` is set to 0. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.**
