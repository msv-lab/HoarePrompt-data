Postcondition: ***`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 1` or `vals[2]` depending on the condition of `d`, `s` is either 'G' or 'B' depending on the condition of `d`. If `c == k`, `d` is now the opposite of its previous value, and `c` is set to 0. If `a < 0 or b < 0`, the program has terminated.***
