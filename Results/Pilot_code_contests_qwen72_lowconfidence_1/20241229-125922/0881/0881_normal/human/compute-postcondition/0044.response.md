The code snippet `d = not d` toggles the boolean value of `d`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Here’s the detailed output state:

- `n` remains `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `k` remains `vals[1]`.
- `b` remains `vals[3]`.
- `a` remains either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` depending on the condition of `d`.
- `s` remains either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the condition of `d`.
- `c` remains `c + 1`.
- The termination condition `a < 0 or b < 0` remains unchanged.
- `d` is now the opposite of its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is `vals[0]` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, 1 ≤ k ≤ `vals[0]` ≤ 105, `k` is `vals[1]`, `b` is `vals[3]`, `a` is either `vals[2] - 2` or `vals[2] - 1` depending on the new condition of `d`, `s` is either 'GG' or 'BG' depending on the new condition of `d`, `c` is `c + 1`, `a < 0 or b < 0` is the termination condition, `d` is the opposite of its previous value.**
