The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in a list called `vals`. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not directly modified by this code, so their conditions remain unchanged. However, the new list `vals` is created.

Output State: **n, k, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n, and a + b = n; `vals` is a list of integers read from input.**
