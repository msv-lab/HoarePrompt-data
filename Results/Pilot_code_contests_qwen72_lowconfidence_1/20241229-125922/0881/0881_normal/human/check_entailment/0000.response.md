Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when `k` is equal to `n` and one of the tea types is zero. For example, consider the input `4 4 4 0`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to drink 4 cups of tea with only green tea bags if `k` is also 4 because it would mean drinking the same type of tea 4 times in a row, which is not allowed. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and outputs `GGGG`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
