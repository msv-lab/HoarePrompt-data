You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innokentiy likes tea very much and today he wants to drink exactly n cups of tea. He would be happy to drink more but he had exactly n tea bags, a of them are green and b are black.

Innokentiy doesn't like to drink the same tea (green or black) more than k times in a row. Your task is to determine the order of brewing tea bags so that Innokentiy will be able to drink n cups of tea, without drinking the same tea more than k times in a row, or to inform that it is impossible. Each tea bag has to be used exactly once.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, a and b (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of cups of tea Innokentiy wants to drink, the maximum number of cups of same tea he can drink in a row, the number of tea bags of green and black tea. It is guaranteed that a + b = n.

Output

If it is impossible to drink n cups of tea, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, print the string of the length n, which consists of characters 'G' and 'B'. If some character equals 'G', then the corresponding cup of tea should be green. If some character equals 'B', then the corresponding cup of tea should be black.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    k = vals[1]
    a = vals[2]

    c = 0
    d = True

        d = False
    s = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if c == k:
            d = not d
            c = 0
        if d:
            s += 'G'
            a -= 1
            c += 1
            if a < b:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        else:
            s += 'B'
            b -= 1
            c += 1
            if b < a:
                d = not d
                c = 0
        if a < 0 or b < 0:
            print('NO')
            quit()
    print(s)

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case when `k` is equal to `n` and one of the tea types is zero. For example, consider the input `4 4 4 0`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to drink 4 cups of tea with only green tea bags if `k` is also 4 because it would mean drinking the same type of tea 4 times in a row, which is not allowed. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and outputs `GGGG`, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads four integers `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from user input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105`, `0 ≤ a, b ≤ n`, and `a + b = n`. It then constructs a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'B'. The function ensures that no more than `k` consecutive 'G' or 'B' characters appear in `s`. If at any point the construction of the string fails (i.e., `a` or `b` becomes negative), the function prints 'NO' and terminates. If the string is successfully constructed, it prints the string `s`. After the function concludes, the state is as follows: `n` is the original value read from input, `k` is the original value read from input, `a` is the original value minus the number of 'G' characters in `s`, `b` is the original value minus the number of 'B' characters in `s`, `c` is between 0 and `k-1`, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'B' characters. If the function prints 'NO', it terminates early without further processing.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
