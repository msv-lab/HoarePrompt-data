Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the step size in the for loop (`2 - n % 2`) is problematic. This step size means that the loop increments by 1 if `n` is even and by 2 if `n` is odd. However, according to the problem, we need to flip the signs of exactly `n` elements in each operation. The current implementation does not ensure that exactly `n` elements are flipped in each iteration, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
Input:
3
-1 -1 -1 1 1
```
The expected output should be 3, because we can flip the signs of the first three elements to get:
```
1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the current code will not necessarily flip exactly 3 elements in each iteration, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the loop should iterate over all possible ways to flip exactly `n` elements and calculate the maximum sum accordingly. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, making the program incorrect.
