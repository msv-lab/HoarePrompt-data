Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw that makes it incorrect for some cases. Specifically, the step size in the loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2 - n % 2)` is not correctly handling the requirement to flip the signs of exactly `n` elements in each operation. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
-1 -2 -3 4 5
```
The correct output should be `15`, which can be achieved by flipping the signs of the first three elements (`-1`, `-2`, `-3`) to make them positive. However, the provided code might not correctly handle this case due to the incorrect step size in the loop.

The step size `2 - n % 2` is intended to ensure that the loop iterates over valid indices, but it does not guarantee that the program will correctly consider all possible ways to flip the signs of exactly `n` elements. This can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.

To fix this, the program should correctly iterate over all possible ways to flip the signs of exactly `n` elements and compute the maximum sum accordingly.
