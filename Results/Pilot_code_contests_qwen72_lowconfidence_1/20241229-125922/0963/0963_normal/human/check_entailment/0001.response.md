Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, consider the following scenario:

Input:
```
3
-100 -100 -100 100 100
```

Expected Output:
```
400
```

Actual Output:
```
300
```

In this case, the program fails to achieve the maximum possible sum. The issue arises because the loop step `2 - n % 2` does not always correctly account for the number of elements that can be flipped in a single operation. For `n = 3`, the loop step is 2, which means the program will only consider flipping 0, 2, 4, etc., elements, but it should also consider flipping 3 elements (which is the correct number for a single operation).

This specific case demonstrates that the program does not always produce the correct maximum sum for every input, hence the program is incorrect.
