The function `func` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of (2·n - 1) integers from the user input. It then sorts the list and calculates the maximum possible value of the sum of the elements in the list, where the sign of the first `i` elements is flipped (i.e., multiplied by -1), and `i` ranges from 0 to (2·n - 1) in steps defined by `2 - n % 2`. The function prints the maximum value found. After execution, `n` remains the same, the list `a` is sorted, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, and the maximum value `res` is printed. Note that the function only performs these actions if it is being executed as the main module. If the function is imported and called from another module, it does nothing.
