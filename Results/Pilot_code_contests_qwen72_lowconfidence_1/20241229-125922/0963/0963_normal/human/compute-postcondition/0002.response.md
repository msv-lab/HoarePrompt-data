The code snippet `n = int(raw_input())` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. This replaces the initial value of `n` with the new input value. The conditions for `n` being an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 remain valid only if the input satisfies these constraints. The other parts of the initial state (`array`, `INT_MIN`, and the program running as the main module) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the array is a list of (2·n - 1) integers where each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, and the program is running as the main module.**
