To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers, each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value.
   - `INT_MIN` is -1000000007.
   - `res` is `sum(a)`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The program is running as the main module.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2 - n % 2):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the For Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - The step size is `2 - n % 2`.

4. **Step Size Analysis:**
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so the step size is `2 - 0 = 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so the step size is `2 - 1 = 1`.

5. **Next Iteration Calculation:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by the step size.
   - If `n` is even, `i` will be 2.
   - If `n` is odd, `i` will be 1.

6. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i < 2 * n`.

7. **Adjusted State:**
   - If `n` is even, `i` will be 2, and the loop will execute again if `2 < 2 * n`.
   - If `n` is odd, `i` will be 1, and the loop will execute again if `1 < 2 * n`.

Since `n` is greater than 0, both conditions (`2 < 2 * n` and `1 < 2 * n`) will always be true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers, each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, `res` is `sum(a)`, `i` is 1 if `n` is odd or 2 if `n` is even**.
