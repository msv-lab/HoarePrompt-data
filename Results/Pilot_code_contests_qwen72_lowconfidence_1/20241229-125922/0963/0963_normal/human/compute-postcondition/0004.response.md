The value of `res` is assigned the value of `INT_MIN`, which is -1000000007. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of (2Â·n - 1) integers, each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, `res` is -1000000007, and the program is running as the main module.**
