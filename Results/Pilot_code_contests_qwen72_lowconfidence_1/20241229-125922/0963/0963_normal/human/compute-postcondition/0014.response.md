The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters within its definition but is expected to operate under the constraints that an integer `n` is provided externally such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and an array is also provided which is a list of (2·n - 1) integers where each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value. The function's output is not specified in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, based on common practices in programming, the function likely processes this array in some manner related to the parameter `n`.

Since the output is not explicitly defined, I will assume the most probable scenario: the function might return a modified version of the array, a specific value calculated from the array, or a boolean indicating a condition about the array.

Given the lack of specific output details, the functionality description will be generalized:

Functionality: **The function operates under the assumption that an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and an array of (2·n - 1) integers (each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value) are provided. It processes this array and returns a result based on the input array and the integer `n`. The exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
