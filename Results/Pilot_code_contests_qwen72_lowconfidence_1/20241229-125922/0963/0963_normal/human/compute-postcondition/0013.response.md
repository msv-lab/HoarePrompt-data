Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the array `a` is a sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers where each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value. `INT_MIN` is -1000000007. If the program is being executed as the main module, `res` is printed, and `i` is set to `2 * n - (2 - n % 2)`.***
