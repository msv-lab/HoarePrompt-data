Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of (2·n - 1) integers from the user input. It then sorts the list and calculates the maximum possible value of the sum of the elements in the list, where the sign of the first `i` elements is flipped (i.e., multiplied by -1), and `i` ranges from 0 to (2·n - 1) in steps defined by `2 - n % 2`. The function prints the maximum value found. After execution, `n` remains the same, the list `a` is sorted, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, and the maximum value `res` is printed. Note that the function only performs these actions if it is being executed as the main module. If the function is imported and called from another module, it does nothing. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Input Validation:** The function assumes valid input without any checks. If `n` is outside the range [2, 100] or if the list length is not (2·n - 1), the behavior is undefined.
- **Module Execution:** The function only performs its intended operations if executed as the main module. If imported and called from another module, it does nothing, which might be unexpected for users.
- **Step Calculation:** The step in the for loop (`2 - n % 2`) can lead to incorrect behavior if `n` is odd, as it will cause the loop to skip some indices. This could result in suboptimal or incorrect results.
