The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and sorts the resulting list. This sorted list is stored in the variable `a`.

- `n` remains an input integer.
- `array` is a list of (2·n - 1) integers, and this list is now sorted and stored in `a`.
- `INT_MIN` remains -1000000007.
- The program is still running as the main module.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers, each element does not exceed 1000 in absolute value, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, and the program is running as the main module.**
