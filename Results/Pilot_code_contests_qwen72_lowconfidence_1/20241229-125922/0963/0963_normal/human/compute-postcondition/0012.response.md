The code snippet `print(res)` outputs the value of `res`. The value of `res` is the maximum value of the sum calculated from the list `a` using the formula `sum([(-x) for x in a[:i]] + a[i:])` for all `i` in the specified range. The variables `n`, `a`, `INT_MIN`, and `i` are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer, `a` is the initial sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, `res` is printed, `i` is `2 * n - (2 - n % 2)`.
Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the initial sorted list of (2·n - 1) integers, `INT_MIN` is -1000000007, `res` is printed, `i` is `2 * n - (2 - n % 2)`**
