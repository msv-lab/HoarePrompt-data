The function processes a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". It calculates the number of valid sequences that can be formed by interpreting these characters, where each sequence ends in a specific pattern, and the counts are taken modulo 1000000007. The function prints the total count of valid sequences ending in "0", "1" (used), or "*". The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly. If the input string `s` is empty, the function will print 0.
