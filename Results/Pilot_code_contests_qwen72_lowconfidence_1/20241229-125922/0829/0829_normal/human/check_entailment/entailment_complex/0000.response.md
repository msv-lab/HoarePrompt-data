Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Initialization and State Management**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `None` at the beginning of the function. However, the initialization of the state variables (`zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, `mine`) is done inside the loop, which means that the first iteration of the loop will set these values. This is incorrect because the initial state should be set before the loop starts.

2. **Handling the Initial State**:
   - The initial state should be set outside the loop. The initial state should be:
     ```python
     zero = 1
     one_used = 0
     one_unused = 1
     two = 0
     mine = 1
     t = (zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)
     ```

3. **State Update Logic**:
   - The state update logic inside the loop is incorrect. For example, the update for `zero` and `one_unused` should be:
     ```python
     zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
     one_unused = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
     ```
   - However, the update for `one_used` and `two` should be:
     ```python
     one_used = t[2]
     two = t[3]
     ```

4. **Final Output**:
   - The final output should be the sum of all valid states, modulo `big_prime`. The current implementation incorrectly prints:
     ```python
     print((t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime)
     ```
   - It should be:
     ```python
     print((t[0] + t[1] + t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % big_prime)
     ```

5. **Handling the First Character**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the first character of the input string. The initial state should be set before the loop starts, and the loop should update the state based on the current character.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func():
    line = input().strip()
    big_prime = 1000000007
    
    # Initial state
    zero = 1
    one_used = 0
    one_unused = 1
    two = 0
    mine = 1
    t = (zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)
    
    for c in line:
        zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
        one_used = t[2]
        one_unused = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
        two = t[3]
        mine = (t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % big_prime
        
        if c == '0':
            t = zero, 0, 0, 0, 0
        elif c == '1':
            t = 0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0
        elif c == '2':
            t = 0, 0, 0, two, 0
        elif c == '*':
            t = 0, 0, 0, 0, mine
        elif c == '?':
            t = zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine
    
    # Final output
    print((t[0] + t[1] + t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % big_prime)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly handle the state transitions and initial state setup, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is **incorrect** according to the problem description.
