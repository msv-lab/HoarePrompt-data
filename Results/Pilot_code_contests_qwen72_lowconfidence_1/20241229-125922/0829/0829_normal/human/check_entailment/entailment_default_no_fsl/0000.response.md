Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to correctly manage the state transitions and the constraints of the problem. Here are a few issues:

1. **State Management**: The code uses a tuple `t` to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending in different states. However, the state transitions are not correctly managed, especially for the cases where the input character is '1' or '2'. For example, the transition for '1' should ensure that the previous cell must be either a bomb ('*') or a '0', but the current code does not enforce this constraint correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the input string is "1", the correct output should be 0 because a single '1' cannot be part of a valid Minesweeper 1D field. However, the current code will not produce the correct output for this case.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The code correctly applies the modulo operation to the results, but the state transitions themselves are incorrect, leading to incorrect final results.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Case "1"**: The code will incorrectly output a non-zero value, while the correct output should be 0.
- **Case "**12"**: The code will not correctly handle the sequence, leading to an incorrect output. The correct output should be 0 because the sequence "**12" cannot be a valid Minesweeper 1D field.

To fix these issues, the state transitions need to be carefully designed to ensure that the constraints of the problem are met. For example, when encountering a '1', the previous cell must be either a '*' or a '0'. Similarly, when encountering a '2', the previous two cells must both be '*'.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
