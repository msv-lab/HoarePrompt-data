You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Game "Minesweeper 1D" is played on a line of squares, the line's height is 1 square, the line's width is n squares. Some of the squares contain bombs. If a square doesn't contain a bomb, then it contains a number from 0 to 2 — the total number of bombs in adjacent squares.

For example, the correct field to play looks like that: 001*2***101*. The cells that are marked with "*" contain bombs. Note that on the correct field the numbers represent the number of bombs in adjacent cells. For example, field 2* is not correct, because cell with value 2 must have two adjacent cells with bombs.

Valera wants to make a correct field to play "Minesweeper 1D". He has already painted a squared field with width of n cells, put several bombs on the field and wrote numbers into some cells. Now he wonders how many ways to fill the remaining cells with bombs and numbers are there if we should get a correct field in the end.

Input

The first line contains sequence of characters without spaces s1s2... sn (1 ≤ n ≤ 106), containing only characters "*", "?" and digits "0", "1" or "2". If character si equals "*", then the i-th cell of the field contains a bomb. If character si equals "?", then Valera hasn't yet decided what to put in the i-th cell. Character si, that is equal to a digit, represents the digit written in the i-th square.

Output

Print a single integer — the number of ways Valera can fill the empty cells and get a correct field.

As the answer can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

Note

Program:
```
def func():
    t = None
    line = raw_input()
    big_prime = 1000000007
    for c in line:
        if t is None:
            zero = 1
            one_used = 0
            one_unused = 1
            two = 0
            mine = 1
        else:
            zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
            one_used = t[4]
            one_unused = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
            two = t[4]
            mine = (t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % big_prime
        if c == '0':
            t = (zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)
        if c == '1':
            t = (0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0)
        if c == '2':
            t = (0, 0, 0, two, 0)
        if c == '*':
            t = (0, 0, 0, 0, mine)
        if c == '?':
            t = (zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)
    print(t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has an issue in the way it initializes and updates the state variables `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine`. Specifically, the initialization and update logic for these variables do not correctly handle the constraints of the Minesweeper 1D game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
?*?
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- For the input `?*?`, there are exactly 2 valid configurations:
  - `0*0`: The first and third cells are both safe and contain 0 bombs.
  - `1*1`: The first and third cells are both safe and each have one adjacent bomb (the middle cell).

However, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program is not correctly handling the constraints for the number of adjacent bombs.

The issue lies in the way the state transitions are handled, particularly in the updates for `one_used` and `one_unused`. The logic for updating these states does not correctly account for the adjacency rules of the game, leading to incorrect counts of valid configurations.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". It calculates the number of valid sequences that can be formed by interpreting these characters, where each sequence ends in a specific pattern, and the counts are taken modulo 1000000007. The function prints the total count of valid sequences ending in "0", "1" (used), or "*". The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly. If the input string `s` is empty, the function will print 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
