Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the final output. The line `print(t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime` should be `print((t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime)` to ensure that the sum is correctly taken modulo `1000000007`. This is a critical error because the result of the addition might exceed the value of `big_prime`, and without the parentheses, the modulo operation would be applied to the wrong expression, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the state transitions and the initial conditions seem to be correctly set up to handle the problem's constraints, but the incorrect placement of the modulo operation invalidates the correctness of the solution for large inputs. For example, if the input is a long string of '?', the sum `t[0] + t[1] + t[4]` could be very large, and the program would produce an incorrect result due to the misplaced modulo operation.
