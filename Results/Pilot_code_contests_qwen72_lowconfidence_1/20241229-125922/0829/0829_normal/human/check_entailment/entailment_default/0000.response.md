Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to correctly calculate the number of valid sequences for certain inputs. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect State Transitions**: The state transitions in the code are not correctly set up to handle all possible configurations of the input string. For example, the transition logic for `one_used` and `one_unused` is not correctly maintaining the count of valid sequences.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the input string is "1?", the correct output should be 1 (since the only valid configuration is "1*"), but the code will produce an incorrect result.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The code incorrectly applies the modulo operation in some places, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the final result should be `(t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime`, but the code has an extra pair of parentheses that could affect the result.

4. **Initial State Setup**: The initial state setup (`zero = 1`, `one_used = 0`, `one_unused = 1`, `two = 0`, `mine = 1`) is not consistent with the problem's requirements. The initial values should be set up to reflect the correct starting conditions for the dynamic programming states.

5. **State Variables**: The state variables `t` are not correctly updated in all cases, leading to incorrect counts of valid sequences.

To ensure the program is correct, it needs to be thoroughly reviewed and the state transitions and initial conditions need to be correctly set up to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
