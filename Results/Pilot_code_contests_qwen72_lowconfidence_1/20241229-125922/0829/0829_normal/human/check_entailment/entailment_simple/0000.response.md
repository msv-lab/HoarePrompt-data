Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the "Minesweeper 1D" problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Initialization of `t`**:
   - The initialization of `t` is done inside the loop, which means it resets `t` at each iteration. This is incorrect because `t` should maintain state across iterations to keep track of the counts of valid sequences ending in different patterns.

2. **Handling of Different Characters**:
   - The program uses a tuple `t` to store the counts of valid sequences ending in specific patterns. However, the way it updates `t` for different characters ('0', '1', '2', '*', '?') is not consistent with the problem requirements. For example, the update for `c == '1'` and `c == '2'` is not correctly handling the constraints of the Minesweeper game.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is calculated as `(t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime`, but this does not account for all possible valid sequences. The problem requires counting all valid ways to fill the remaining cells, which should include all valid sequences ending in "0", "1", "2", and "*".

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Maintain a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending in different states.
- Update the DP table based on the current character and the previous states.
- Ensure that the transitions between states are consistent with the rules of the Minesweeper game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def minesweeper_1d():
    line = input().strip()
    big_prime = 1000000007
    
    # Initialize DP arrays
    dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  # dp[0]: 0, dp[1]: 1 used, dp[2]: 1 unused, dp[3]: 2, dp[4]: *
    
    for c in line:
        new_dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        
        if c == '0':
            new_dp[0] = dp[0] + dp[2]  # 0 can follow 0 or 1 unused
            new_dp[2] = dp[0] + dp[2]  # 1 unused can follow 0 or 1 unused
            new_dp[4] = dp[4]  # * can follow *
        
        elif c == '1':
            new_dp[1] = dp[4]  # 1 used can follow *
            new_dp[2] = dp[0] + dp[2]  # 1 unused can follow 0 or 1 unused
        
        elif c == '2':
            new_dp[3] = dp[4]  # 2 can follow *
        
        elif c == '*':
            new_dp[4] = (dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4]) % big_prime  # * can follow 0, 1 unused, or *
        
        elif c == '?':
            new_dp[0] = (dp[0] + dp[2]) % big_prime  # ? can be 0
            new_dp[1] = dp[4]  # ? can be 1 used
            new_dp[2] = (dp[0] + dp[2]) % big_prime  # ? can be 1 unused
            new_dp[3] = dp[4]  # ? can be 2
            new_dp[4] = (dp[0] + dp[2] + dp[4]) % big_prime  # ? can be *
        
        dp = new_dp
    
    # Sum up all valid sequences
    result = (dp[0] + dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[3] + dp[4]) % big_prime
    print(result)

minesweeper_1d()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

- **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` to handle the initial state.
- **State Transitions**:
  - For `c == '0'`: A '0' can only follow a '0' or a '1' that is unused.
  - For `c == '1'`: A '1' can only follow a '*' (since it must be followed by a bomb).
  - For `c == '2'`: A '2' can only follow a '*' (since it must be followed by two bombs).
  - For `c == '*'`: A '*' can follow any valid state.
  - For `c == '?'`: A '?' can be filled with any valid character ('0', '1', '2', or '*').
- **Final Output**: The sum of all valid sequences is calculated and printed modulo `1000000007`.

This corrected program ensures that all valid sequences are counted correctly according to the problem description.
