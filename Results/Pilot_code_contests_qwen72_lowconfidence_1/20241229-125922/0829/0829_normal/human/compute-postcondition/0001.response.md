The code reads a line from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `line`. The initial state specifies that the input is a string `s` of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and `s` consists of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". The variable `t` remains `None`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is `None`; `line` is the input string `s`.**
