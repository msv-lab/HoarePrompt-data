The given code snippet assigns the tuple `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)` to the variable `t`. This operation does not depend on the value of `c` or any other conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the third character in `line`.
- The initial values of `t`, `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` are not specified, but their potential changes are described based on the value of `c`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` is set to `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`.
- The values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the third character in `line`; `t` is `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`; `zero` is unchanged; `one_used` is unchanged; `one_unused` is unchanged; `two` is unchanged; `mine` is unchanged.**
