Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`. If `c` is '?', `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`. If `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, mine)`. If `c` is '2', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`. If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', the values of `t`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.***
