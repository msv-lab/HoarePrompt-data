Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)` if `c` is '0', otherwise `t` remains unchanged; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is '1'; if `t` was `None` before, then `zero` is 1; `one_used` is 0; `one_unused` is 1; `two` is 0; `mine` is 1; if `t` was not `None` before, then `zero` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`; `one_used` is `t[4]`; `one_unused` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`; `two` is `t[4]`; `mine` is `(t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % 1000000007`.***
