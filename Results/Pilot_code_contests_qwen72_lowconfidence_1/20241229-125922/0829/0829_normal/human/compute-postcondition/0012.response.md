The code snippet `one_used = t[4]` assigns the value of the fifth element of the tuple `t` to the variable `one_used`. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is not `None`; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line`; `zero` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`; `one_used` is `t[4]`**.
