Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the first character in `line` and is equal to '?'.
- The tuple `t` is assigned the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine`.

Since `c` is '?', which is not '*', the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, `mine`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is equal to '?'; `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`; `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.**
