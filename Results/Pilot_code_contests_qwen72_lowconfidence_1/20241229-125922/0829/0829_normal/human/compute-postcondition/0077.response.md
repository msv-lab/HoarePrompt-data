The code prints the sum of `t[0]`, `t[1]`, and `t[4]`, modulo `big_prime`. The values of `t[0]`, `t[1]`, and `t[4]` are added together, and the result is taken modulo `big_prime`. The values of `t` and `big_prime` remain unchanged. The value of `line` and `s` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `t` is a tuple where each element represents the count of valid sequences ending in a specific pattern, modulo `big_prime`; the value `(t[0] + t[1] + t[4]) % big_prime` is printed.**
