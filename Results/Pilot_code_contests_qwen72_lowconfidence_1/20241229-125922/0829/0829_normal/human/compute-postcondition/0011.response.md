The code snippet `zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime` affects the variable `zero`. The value of `zero` is calculated as the sum of the first and second elements of `t` modulo `big_prime`.

- `t[0]` and `t[1]` are elements from the sequence `t`.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- The calculation `(t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime` ensures that the result is within the range [0, 1000000006].

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `line`, `c`, `big_prime`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is not `None`; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line`; `zero` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`**.
