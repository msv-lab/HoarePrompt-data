The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The string `s` consists of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". 

Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, I cannot provide a complete description of the functionality without making assumptions. However, based on the given input constraints, the function likely processes the string `s` in some way, possibly interpreting the special characters "*" and "?" and the digits "0", "1", or "2" according to some rules.

If you can provide more details about the expected output, I can refine the description of the function's functionality.

For now, I'll assume the function returns some processed form of the string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". The function returns a processed form of the string `s` based on the interpretation of its characters.**
