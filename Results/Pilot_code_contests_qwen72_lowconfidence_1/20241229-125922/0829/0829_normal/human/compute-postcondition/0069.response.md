Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the third character in `line`. If `c` is '1', `t` is set to `(0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0)`. If `c` is '0' and `t` was `None`, `t` is set to `(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged. If `c` is '0' and `t` was not `None`, `zero` is set to `0`, `one_unused` is set to `(t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime`, `two` is set to `one_used`, and `mine` is set to `(t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % big_prime`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '1', the values of `t`, `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.***
