Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the first character in `line` and is '2'.
- If `c` is '1', then `t` is updated to `(0, 0, 1, 0, 0)`, `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, `mine` is 1, and `zero` is 1.
- If `c` is not '1' and `t` was `None` before, then `zero` is 1, `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, `mine` is 1, and `t` remains unchanged.
- If `c` is not '1' and `t` was not `None` before, then `zero` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`, `one_used` is `t[4]`, `one_unused` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`, `two` is `t[4]`, `mine` is `(t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % 1000000007`, and `t` remains unchanged.
- If `c` is '0', `t` is updated to `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.
- Since `c` is '2', the current value of `c` is '2'.

Code Snippet:
```python
t = 0, 0, 0, two, 0
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `c` is '2'.
2. Since `c` is not '1', we need to check the conditions for when `c` is not '1'.
3. The condition for when `c` is not '1' and `t` was `None` before does not apply because `t` is being updated in the code snippet.
4. The condition for when `c` is not '1' and `t` was not `None` before also does not apply because `t` is being updated in the code snippet.
5. The code snippet updates `t` to `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`.
6. The value of `two` is not explicitly given, but since `c` is '2', and based on the initial conditions, `two` would be 0 if `t` was `None` or `t[4]` if `t` was not `None`.

Therefore, the updated value of `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.

Output State:
**`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is '2'; `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`; `zero` is 1; `one_used` is 0; `one_unused` is 1; `two` is 0; `mine` is 1.**
