The given code snippet is:
```python
t = 0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. The tuple `t` is being assigned new values.
2. The first element of `t` is set to 0.
3. The second element of `t` is set to the current value of `one_used`.
4. The third element of `t` is set to the current value of `one_unused`.
5. The fourth element of `t` is set to 0.
6. The fifth element of `t` is set to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the second character in `line`.
- If `c` is '0', `t` is `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.
- If `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block if `t` was initially `None`, or `one_used` is 1, `one_unused` is 0, `two` is 1, and `mine` is 1 if `t` was not `None`.
- If `c` is '?', `t` is `(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)` and `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, and `mine` is 1 if `t` was initially `None`, or `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, `one_used` is `mine`, `one_unused` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`, `two` is `mine`, and `mine` is `3 * mine % big_prime` if `t` was not `None`.

The code snippet does not affect the values of `s`, `line`, `big_prime`, `c`, `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, or `mine` directly. It only updates the tuple `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`; `t` is `(0, one_used, one_unused, 0, 0)`**.
