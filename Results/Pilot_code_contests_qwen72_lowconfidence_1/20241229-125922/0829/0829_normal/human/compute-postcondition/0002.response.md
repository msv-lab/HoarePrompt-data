The code snippet introduces a new variable `big_prime` and assigns it the value `1000000007`. This does not affect the existing variables `s`, `t`, and `line`. The state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is `None`; `line` is the input string `s`; `big_prime` is 1000000007.**
