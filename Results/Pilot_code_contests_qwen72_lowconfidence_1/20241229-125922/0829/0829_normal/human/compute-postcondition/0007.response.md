The code snippet `one_unused = 1` introduces a new variable `one_unused` and assigns it the value 1. This does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `t` is `None`; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line`; `zero` is 1; `one_used` is 0; `one_unused` is 1.**
