Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is equal to '*'. If `c` is '2', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)`, `zero` is 1, `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, and `mine` is 1. If `c` is not '2', the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, `mine`, and `t` remain as they were before the if-else block.***
