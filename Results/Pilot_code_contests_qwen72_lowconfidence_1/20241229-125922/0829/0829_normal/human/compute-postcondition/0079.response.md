Functionality: ** The function processes a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2". It calculates the number of valid sequences that can be formed by interpreting these characters, where each sequence ends in a specific pattern, and the counts are taken modulo 1000000007. The function prints the total count of valid sequences ending in "0", "1" (used), or "*". The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly. If the input string `s` is empty, the function will print 0. **

### Key Points:
- **Input:** A string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) containing characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- **Output:** The function prints the total count of valid sequences ending in "0", "1" (used), or "*" modulo 1000000007.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the input string `s` is empty, the function will print 0.
  - The function handles the characters "0", "1", "2", "*", and "?" according to the specified rules.
  - The function uses a tuple `t` to keep track of the counts of valid sequences ending in specific patterns, updating it based on the current character in the string.
- **Missing Functionality:**
  - The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., characters other than "*", "?", "0", "1", or "2").
  - The function does not return a value; it only prints the result.
