Initial State: `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`. If `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, and the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block. If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, and the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.

The code snippet:
```
zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `zero` is updated to `(t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime`.

Let's consider the two cases for `c`:

### Case 1: `c` is '*'
- `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`
- `zero` is updated to `(0 + 0) % big_prime`, which simplifies to `0`.

### Case 2: `c` is '?'
- `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`
- `zero` is updated to `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.

Output State:
- If `c` is '*', then `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is '?', then `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.

The other variables (`one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, `mine`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`. If `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)` and `zero` is `0`. If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)` and `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`. The values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.**
