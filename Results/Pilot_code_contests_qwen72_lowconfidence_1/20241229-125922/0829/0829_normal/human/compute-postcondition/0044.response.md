The code snippet assigns the tuple `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)` to the variable `t`. This operation changes the value of `t` from its initial state to this new tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the second character in `line`.
- If `t` is `None`, then:
  - If `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)` and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.
  - If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)` and `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, and `mine` is 1.
- If `t` is not `None`, then:
  - If `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, `one_used` is 1, `one_unused` is 0, `two` is 1, and `mine` is 1.
  - If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, `one_used` is `mine`, `one_unused` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`, `two` is `mine`, and `mine` is `3 * mine % big_prime`.

The code snippet:
```python
t = zero, 0, 0, 0, 0
```

Impact:
- `t` is now `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.

The output state remains consistent with the initial state except for the updated value of `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`; `t` is `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`.**
