The initial state provides that `c` is the first character in `line` and is equal to `'*'`. The code snippet assigns a tuple to `t` with the last element being `mine`.

Since `c` is not `'2'`, the values of `zero`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, `mine`, and `t` remain as they were before the if-else block. However, the assignment `t = 0, 0, 0, 0, mine` changes the value of `t` from its previous state to `(0, 0, 0, 0, mine)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is equal to '*'; `zero` is 1; `one_used` is 0; `one_unused` is 1; `two` is 0; `mine` is 1; `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`**
