The given code snippet assigns the value of `t[4]` to the variable `one_used`. Let's analyze the impact of this assignment on the program state:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the third character in `line`.
- If `c` is '?', `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.
- If `c` is '*', `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is '2', `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', `zero` remains unchanged.

The code snippet `one_used = t[4]` updates the value of `one_used` to the value at index 4 of the list `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the third character in `line`.
- `one_used` is now `t[4]`.
- If `c` is '?', `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.
- If `c` is '*', `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is '2', `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', `zero` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the third character in `line`; `one_used` is `t[4]`; if `c` is '?', `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`; if `c` is '*', `zero` is `0`; if `c` is '2', `zero` is `0`; if `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', `zero` remains unchanged.**
