The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `mine`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Here is the detailed output state:

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the second character in `line`.
- If `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.
- If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block.
- `one_used` is 0.
- `one_unused` is 1.
- `two` is 0.
- `mine` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`; if `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block; if `c` is '?', then `t` is `(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)`, and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block; `one_used` is 0; `one_unused` is 1; `two` is 0; `mine` is 1.**
