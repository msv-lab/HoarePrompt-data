Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`. If `t` is `None`, then if `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)` and the values of `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain as they were before the if-else block. If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)` and `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, and `mine` is 1. If `t` is not `None`, then if `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, `one_used` is 1, `one_unused` is 0, `two` is 1, and `mine` is 1. If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, `one_used` is `mine`, `one_unused` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`, `two` is `mine`, and `mine` is `3 * mine % big_prime`.***
