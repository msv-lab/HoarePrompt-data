Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the first character in `line` and is '2'. If `c` is '1', then `t` is updated to `(0, 0, 1, 0, 0)`, `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, `mine` is 1, and `zero` is 1. If `c` is not '1' and `t` was `None` before, then `zero` is 1, `one_used` is 0, `one_unused` is 1, `two` is 0, `mine` is 1, and `t` remains unchanged. If `c` is not '1' and `t` was not `None` before, then `zero` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`, `one_used` is `t[4]`, `one_unused` is `(t[0] + t[1]) % 1000000007`, `two` is `t[4]`, `mine` is `(t[2] + t[3] + t[4]) % 1000000007`, and `t` remains unchanged. If `c` is '0', `t` is updated to `(zero, 0, 0, 0, 0)`. Since `c` is '2', the current value of `c` is '2'.***
