The value of `one_used` is updated to `t[4]`. Based on the initial conditions, the value of `t` depends on the second character `c` in the `line`:

- If `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)`, and `one_used` is set to `t[4]`, which is `1`.
- If `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`, and `one_used` is set to `t[4]`, which is `mine`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the second character in `line`; if `c` is '*', then `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)` and `one_used` is `1`; if `c` is '?', then `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)` and `one_used` is `mine`; `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime` if `c` is '?', otherwise `zero` is `0`.**
