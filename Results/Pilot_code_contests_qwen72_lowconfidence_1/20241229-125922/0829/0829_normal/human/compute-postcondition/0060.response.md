The given code snippet updates the value of `zero` based on the tuple `t` and the constant `big_prime`.

- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2".
- `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty.
- `big_prime` is 1000000007.
- `c` is the third character in `line`.
- If `c` is '?', `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`.
- If `c` is '*', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, mine)`.
- If `c` is '2', `t` is `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`.
- If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', the values of `t`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.

The code snippet:
```python
zero = (t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime
```

### Impact of the Code:
- `zero` is updated to the sum of the first and second elements of the tuple `t`, modulo `big_prime`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Determine the value of `c` from the third character of `line`.
2. Based on the value of `c`, determine the tuple `t`.
3. Calculate the new value of `zero` using the formula `(t[0] + t[1]) % big_prime`.

### Possible Cases:
1. **If `c` is '?'**:
   - `t` is `(zero, one_used, one_unused, two, mine)`.
   - `zero` becomes `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.

2. **If `c` is '*'**:
   - `t` is `(0, 0, 0, 0, mine)`.
   - `zero` becomes `(0 + 0) % big_prime = 0`.

3. **If `c` is '2'**:
   - `t` is `(0, 0, 0, two, 0)`.
   - `zero` becomes `(0 + 0) % big_prime = 0`.

4. **If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?'**:
   - The values of `t`, `one_used`, `one_unused`, `two`, and `mine` remain unchanged.
   - `zero` remains unchanged.

### Output State:
- If `c` is '?': `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`.
- If `c` is '*': `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is '2': `zero` is `0`.
- If `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?': `zero` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of characters "*", "?", and digits "0", "1", or "2"; `line` is the input string `s` and must be non-empty; `big_prime` is 1000000007; `c` is the third character in `line`; if `c` is '?', `zero` is `(zero + one_used) % big_prime`; if `c` is '*', `zero` is `0`; if `c` is '2', `zero` is `0`; if `c` is neither '*', '2', nor '?', `zero` remains unchanged.**
