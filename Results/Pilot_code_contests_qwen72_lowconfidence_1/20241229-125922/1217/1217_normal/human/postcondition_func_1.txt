The function `func_2` is designed to traverse a tree structure, starting from a given vertex `n`. It marks the vertex `n` as visited and updates the `gcdinfo` dictionary based on the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) calculations involving the values stored in `a` and the parent's `gcdinfo`. The function recursively visits all neighbors of the current vertex `n` in the tree. Here are the key points about its functionality:
