The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, where at least one of them is not zero. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function immediately returns `a`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b` until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD. The function correctly handles the edge case where either `a` or `b` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is returned even if one of the inputs is zero.
