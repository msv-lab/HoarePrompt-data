The code sets the value of `visited[n]` to `True`. This indicates that the vertex `n` has now been visited. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and parent is an integer representing the parent vertex of n or -1 if n is the root. The vertex n has been visited (`visited[n] = True`).**
