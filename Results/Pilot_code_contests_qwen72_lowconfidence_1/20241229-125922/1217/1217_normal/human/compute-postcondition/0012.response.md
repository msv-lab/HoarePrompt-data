The code `gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]` updates the `ifr2` attribute of `gcdinfo[n]` to the value of `a[n]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n`, `visited[n] = True`, `parent` is not -1, `newgcd` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd = newgcd`, the current value of `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = a[n]`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, `gcdinfo[n].tor2 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]`.**
