The code snippet updates the `ifr1` attribute of the `gcdinfo[n]` object to the value of `ifr1` from the `gcdinfo[parent]` object. This impacts only the `ifr1` attribute of `gcdinfo[n]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n`, `visited[n] = True`, `parent` is not -1, `newgcd` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd = newgcd`, `newgcd` is greater than or equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, `newgcd1` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])` otherwise `newgcd1 = 1`, if `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true, `newgcd2 = func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])` otherwise `newgcd2 = 1`, the current value of `newgcd1` is greater than the current value of `newgcd2`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = gcdinfo[parent].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`**
