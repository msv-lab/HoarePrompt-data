Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n`, `visited[n] = True`, `parent` is not -1, `newgcd` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`, `gcdinfo[n].gcd = newgcd`, and `newgcd` is greater than or equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, `newgcd1` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`. Otherwise, `newgcd1 = 1`. Additionally, `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is false.***
