The function call `func_2(neigh, n)` does not provide enough information about the function's behavior to determine its exact impact on the state of the program. However, based on the initial state and the given code snippet, we can infer the following:

- The function `func_2` is called with two arguments: `neigh` (which is assumed to be a neighbor of vertex `n` in the graph) and `n` (the current vertex).
- The function call itself does not modify the state of the program directly (assuming `func_2` does not return a value that affects the state).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root.
- `visited[n] = True`.
- `graph[n]` must contain at least one neighbor.
- `newgcd` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])` if `parent` is not -1, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`.
- If `newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = a[n]` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.
- If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]`.
- Otherwise, if `newgcd >= gcdinfo[parent].gcd`:
  - If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, `newgcd1` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`; otherwise, `newgcd1 = 1`.
  - If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true, `newgcd2` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`; otherwise, `newgcd2 = 1`.
  - If `newgcd1 > newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = gcdinfo[parent].tor1` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`.
  - If `newgcd1 <= newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`.
- If `parent` is -1, no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]` or any other variables.

Since the function `func_2` is called, and assuming it does not return a value or modify any global state, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_2` has been called.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root, `visited[n] = True`, `graph[n]` must contain at least one neighbor, `newgcd` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])` if `parent` is not -1, and `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`. If `newgcd < gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = a[n]` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].gcd`. If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2 = a[n]`. Otherwise, if `newgcd >= gcdinfo[parent].gcd`: If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is true, `newgcd1` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr1, a[n])`; otherwise, `newgcd1 = 1`. If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` is true, `newgcd2` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].ifr2, a[n])`; otherwise, `newgcd2 = 1`. If `newgcd1 > newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1 = gcdinfo[parent].tor1` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1 = gcdinfo[parent].ifr1`. If `newgcd1 <= newgcd2`, then `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].tor2` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2`. If `parent` is -1, no changes are made to `gcdinfo[n]` or any other variables. `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called.**
