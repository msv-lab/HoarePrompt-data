The code snippet assigns the result of the function call `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])` to the variable `newgcd`. Here's the updated state:

- `n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree.
- `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n`.
- The vertex `n` has been visited (`visited[n] = True`).
- `parent` is not -1, indicating that `n` is not the root of the tree.
- `newgcd` is now equal to the result of `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n`, `visited[n] = True`, `parent` is not -1, `newgcd` is equal to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])`.**
