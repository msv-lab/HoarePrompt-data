The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `parent`. `n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root. After executing the function body, the function does not return any value (returns `None`). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters, `n` and `parent`, where `n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root, and the function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `parent`, where `n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, and `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root, and does not return any value.**
