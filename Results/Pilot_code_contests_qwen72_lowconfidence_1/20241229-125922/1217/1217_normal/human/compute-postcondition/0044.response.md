Functionality: ** The function `func_2` is designed to traverse a tree structure, starting from a given vertex `n`. It marks the vertex `n` as visited and updates the `gcdinfo` dictionary based on the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) calculations involving the values stored in `a` and the parent's `gcdinfo`. The function recursively visits all neighbors of the current vertex `n` in the tree. Here are the key points about its functionality:

1. **Parameters**:
   - `n`: A non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree.
   - `parent`: An integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The function does not return any value (returns `None`).

3. **Function Behavior**:
   - If the vertex `n` has already been visited (`visited[n]` is `True`), the function returns immediately.
   - Otherwise, it marks the vertex `n` as visited (`visited[n] = True`).
   - If `parent` is not -1 (i.e., `n` is not the root):
     - It calculates a new GCD (`newgcd`) between the current vertex's value `a[n]` and the parent's GCD (`gcdinfo[parent].gcd`).
     - It updates `gcdinfo[n].gcd` to `newgcd`.
     - Depending on the relationship between `newgcd` and `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`, it updates additional fields in `gcdinfo[n]`:
       - If `newgcd` is less than `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`:
         - `gcdinfo[n].tor1` is set to `a[n]`.
         - `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` is set to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`.
         - If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` is 0, `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` is set to `a[n]`.
       - If `newgcd` is greater than or equal to `gcdinfo[parent].gcd`:
         - It calculates two additional GCDs (`newgcd1` and `newgcd2`) using the parent's `ifr1` and `ifr2` values.
         - It updates `gcdinfo[n].tor1` and `gcdinfo[n].ifr1` based on which of `newgcd1` or `newgcd2` is greater.
   - The function then recursively calls itself for each neighbor of `n` in the graph.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the function completes, the vertex `n` and all its descendants in the tree (if any) are marked as visited.
   - The `gcdinfo` dictionary is updated with the GCD information for the vertex `n` and its descendants.
   - The function does not modify the `graph` or `a` lists directly, but it relies on them for its operations.
   - The function ensures that the GCD information is propagated correctly through the tree, considering the relationships between parent and child nodes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is the root (i.e., `parent` is -1), the function only marks `n` as visited and does not update `gcdinfo[n]` with any parent-related values.
   - If `n` has no neighbors, the function simply marks `n` as visited and updates `gcdinfo[n]` if `parent` is not -1.
   - If `gcdinfo[parent].ifr1` or `gcdinfo[parent].ifr2` are 0, the corresponding GCD calculations (`newgcd1` or `newgcd2`) are set to 1.

In summary, `func_2` is a recursive function that traverses a tree, updating GCD information for each vertex and its descendants. **
