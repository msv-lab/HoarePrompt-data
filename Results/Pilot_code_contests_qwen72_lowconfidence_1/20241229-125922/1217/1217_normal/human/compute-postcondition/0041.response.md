The function `func_2(neigh, n)` is called with the parameters `neigh` and `n`. Based on the initial state, this function call does not change the values of `n`, `parent`, `visited[n]`, `graph[n]`, `newgcd`, or any attributes of `gcdinfo[n]`. However, the exact changes or side effects caused by `func_2(neigh, n)` are not specified in the initial state, so we assume that it performs some operations but does not alter the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged from the initial state:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of `n` or -1 if `n` is the root, `visited[n] = True`, `graph[n]` must contain at least one more neighbor, `newgcd` is set to `func_1(gcdinfo[parent].gcd, a[n])` if `parent` is not -1, `gcdinfo[n].gcd` is updated to `newgcd`, `gcdinfo[n].tor1`, `gcdinfo[n].ifr1`, and `gcdinfo[n].ifr2` are updated based on the conditions described, `func_2(neigh, n)` has been called for the current `neigh`.**
