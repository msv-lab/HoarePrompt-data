Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This discrepancy would cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Handling of the GCD Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the GCD for each vertex correctly using the `func_1` function, which is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm.
   - However, the logic for updating the `gcdinfo` structure is overly complex and may not always produce the correct results. Specifically, the conditions for updating `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2` are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirement to find the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

3. **Initialization and Propagation**:
   - The initialization of the root node (`gcdinfo[0].gcd = a[0]`) is correct.
   - The propagation of the GCD values through the tree using the `func_2` function is intended to update the `gcdinfo` structure for each vertex. However, the logic for handling the cases where the GCD changes or remains the same is not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The final output is constructed correctly by iterating over the `gcdinfo` structure and calling the `get` method, which returns the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

### Specific Issues:
- **Complexity and Clarity**: The logic for updating the `gcdinfo` structure is overly complex and difficult to follow. It involves multiple nested conditions and updates that may not always result in the correct maximum beauty for each vertex.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not clearly handle edge cases, such as when the GCD of a path is 1, or when the GCD of a path is already maximized and cannot be increased by changing a single vertex value to 0.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
3
6 2 3
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output is:
```
6 6 6
```
However, the program's logic for updating the `gcdinfo` structure might not always produce this result due to the complexity and potential misalignment with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to its complex and potentially flawed logic for updating the `gcdinfo` structure. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
