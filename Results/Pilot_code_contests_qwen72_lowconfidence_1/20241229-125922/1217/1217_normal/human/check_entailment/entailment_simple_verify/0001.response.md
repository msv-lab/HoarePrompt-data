Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The annotated version shows that the necessary data structures (`visited`, `gcdinfo`, and `graph`) are properly initialized before the recursive function `func_2` is called. Specifically:
   - `visited` is initialized to `[False] * n`.
   - `gcdinfo` is initialized to a list of `Info` objects.
   - `graph` is initialized to a list of empty lists, and edges are added to it based on the input.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations confirm that it works as expected.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function is responsible for traversing the tree and computing the GCD values for each vertex. The annotations provide a detailed state of the program at various points, confirming that:
   - The function correctly updates the `gcdinfo` for each vertex based on its parent.
   - It handles the cases where the GCD of the current vertex and its parent is less than or greater than the parent's GCD.
   - It correctly propagates the GCD information to all children of the current vertex.

4. **Output**: After the traversal, the program constructs the output string by calling the `get` method on each `Info` object in `gcdinfo`, which returns the maximum possible beauty for each vertex. The annotations confirm that this step is performed correctly.

Given the detailed annotations and the fact that the program initializes all necessary data structures and correctly computes the required values, the program appears to meet the problem description and handle all potential cases as required. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** was incorrect, and the program should be deemed **True**.
