Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet is incomplete and lacks several critical components required to solve the problem correctly:

1. **Initialization of Variables**: The variables `visited`, `gcdinfo`, and `graph` are used but not initialized. This will lead to runtime errors when the program tries to access these uninitialized variables.

2. **Data Structures for GCD Information**: The `gcdinfo` structure is not defined. It is referenced in the code, but its structure (e.g., whether it is a list of dictionaries or another data structure) is not specified.

3. **Graph Construction**: The graph is not constructed from the input edges. The `graph` variable is used to traverse the tree, but it is never populated with the edges provided in the input.

4. **Handling the Root Node**: The root node (vertex 1) is not handled separately, which is crucial for initializing the GCD information for the rest of the tree.

5. **Output Generation**: The program does not generate the required output. It does not print the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

Given these issues, the program will fail to produce the correct output for any valid input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
