Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where changing a node's value to 0 results in a different maximum beauty. Specifically, the program calculates the GCD of the path from the root to each node but does not consider the scenario where changing a node's value to 0 can increase the maximum possible beauty of other nodes.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
6 2 3 4
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
The expected output should be:
```
6 6 6 6
```
However, the program will output:
```
6 2 3 4
```
This is because the program does not account for the possibility of changing the value of a node to 0, which can potentially increase the GCD for other nodes. For instance, if we change the value of node 2 to 0, the GCD for node 4 would be 6 (the GCD of 6, 0, and 4).

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
