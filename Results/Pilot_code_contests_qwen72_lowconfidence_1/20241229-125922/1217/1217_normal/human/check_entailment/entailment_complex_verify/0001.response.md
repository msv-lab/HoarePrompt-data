Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, let's evaluate the correctness of the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Input**: A tree with \( n \) vertices, where each vertex \( i \) has an integer \( a_i \). The tree is represented by edges between vertices.
- **Output**: For each vertex, the maximum possible beauty (GCD of all numbers on the path from the root to the vertex, possibly after changing one vertex value to 0).

### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Reasoning**: The program does not handle the initialization of the `visited`, `gcdinfo`, and `graph` data structures, which are crucial for the function `func_2` to work correctly. Without these initializations, the program will likely fail with errors such as undefined variables or accessing uninitialized data structures. Additionally, the structure of `gcdinfo` is not defined, and it is unclear how it is supposed to store the necessary information for the algorithm to work.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = int(raw_input())`: Reads the number of vertices.
   - `a = map(int, raw_input().split())`: Reads the values of the vertices.
   - `graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]`: Initializes the adjacency list for the graph.
   - `for i in xrange(n - 1):`: Reads the edges and constructs the graph.
   - `class Info:`: Defines a class to store GCD-related information.
   - `visited = [False] * n`: Initializes the visited array.
   - `gcdinfo = [Info() for _ in range(n)]`: Initializes the `gcdinfo` array with instances of the `Info` class.
   - `gcdinfo[0].gcd = a[0]`: Sets the GCD of the root vertex.
   - `gcdinfo[0].tor1 = a[0]`: Sets the first possible GCD change for the root vertex.
   - `gcdinfo[0].ifr1 = 0`: Initializes the first possible GCD change to 0 for the root vertex.

2. **DFS Traversal (`func_2`)**:
   - Marks the current vertex as visited.
   - If the vertex has a parent, calculates the new GCD and updates the `gcdinfo` accordingly.
   - Recursively visits all neighbors of the current vertex.

3. **Output**:
   - Constructs the output string by calling the `get` method of each `Info` object in `gcdinfo`.

### Key Points:
- **Initialization**: The annotated code properly initializes the `visited`, `gcdinfo`, and `graph` data structures.
- **DFS Traversal**: The `func_2` function correctly traverses the tree and updates the `gcdinfo` based on the GCD calculations.
- **Output Construction**: The output is constructed by calling the `get` method of each `Info` object, which returns the maximum possible beauty for each vertex.

### Conclusion:
The annotated code addresses the issues mentioned in the original assessment. It initializes all necessary data structures and correctly implements the DFS traversal to calculate the maximum possible beauty for each vertex. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
