Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Handling of Zero Values**: The problem states that Ilya can change the number in one arbitrary vertex to 0. However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where setting a vertex value to 0 would maximize the beauty of other vertices. The `gcdinfo` structure and the logic in `func_2` do not account for this possibility. For example, if setting a vertex value to 0 could increase the GCD of the path to another vertex, the current code does not consider this scenario.

2. **Incorrect GCD Calculation Logic**: The logic for updating the `gcdinfo` structure in `func_2` is complex and potentially flawed. Specifically, the conditions and assignments for `tor1`, `ifr1`, `tor2`, and `ifr2` are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the beauty of each vertex. The logic for updating these values does not seem to correctly handle all edge cases, especially when the GCD changes due to the presence of a zero value.

3. **Output Validation**: The final output is constructed by iterating over the `gcdinfo` array and calling the `get` method. However, the `get` method only returns the maximum of `gcd`, `ifr1`, and `ifr2`, which may not always reflect the maximum possible beauty if a zero value could be used to increase the GCD.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- Consider a tree with vertices 1, 2, and 3, where the values are 6, 2, and 3 respectively, and edges (1, 2) and (1, 3).
- The correct output should be 6, 6, 6 because setting the value of vertex 2 or 3 to 0 would maximize the beauty of all vertices to 6.
- However, the provided code does not handle the case of setting a vertex value to 0, so it may produce an incorrect output.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
