Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the initialization of the `visited`, `gcdinfo`, and `graph` data structures, which are crucial for the function `func_2` to work correctly. Without these initializations, the program will likely fail with errors such as undefined variables or accessing uninitialized data structures. Additionally, the structure of `gcdinfo` is not defined, and it is unclear how it is supposed to store the necessary information for the algorithm to work. These issues mean that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
