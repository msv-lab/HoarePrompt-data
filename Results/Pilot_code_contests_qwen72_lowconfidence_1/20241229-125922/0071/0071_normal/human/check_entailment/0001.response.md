Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where `k < n + 1` but still allows for a valid solution. The program only checks if `k >= n + 1` and prints `-1` if this condition is not met. However, there can be valid solutions even when `k < n + 1`, as long as the paths can be constructed without exceeding the number of allowed roads.

For example, consider the following input:
```
7 10
2 4 7 3
```
Here, `k = 10`, which is less than `n + 1 = 8`. According to the program, it would print `-1` because `k < n + 1`. However, it is possible to construct valid paths that use fewer than 10 roads. For instance:
```
2 7 1 3 6 5 4
7 1 5 4 6 2 3
```
This solution uses exactly 10 roads, which is within the allowed limit of `k`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this edge case properly.
