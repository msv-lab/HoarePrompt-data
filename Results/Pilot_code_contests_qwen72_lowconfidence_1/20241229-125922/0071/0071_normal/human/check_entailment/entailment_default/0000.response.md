Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - When `n == 4`, the code directly prints `-1`. However, this is not always correct. For example, if `n = 4`, `k = 5`, and the cities are `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, `d = 4`, it is possible to construct valid paths:
     ```
     1 3 4 2
     3 1 2 4
     ```
     This configuration uses exactly 5 roads, which is within the limit of `k = 5`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The code constructs the `chain` list by appending all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}`. However, it does not ensure that the constructed paths are valid Hamiltonian paths (visiting each city exactly once) and that they satisfy the conditions of starting and ending at the specified cities.
   - The swapping of the last two elements in `p1` and the first two elements in `p2` is not guaranteed to produce valid paths. For example, if the `chain` list is `[a, c, 1, 2, b, d]`, swapping the last two elements might result in a path that does not end at `b` or start at `c`.

3. **Road Count Validation**:
   - The code checks if `k >= n + 1` before constructing the paths. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the constructed paths will use at most `k` roads. The actual number of roads used by the paths should be validated against `k`.

To summarize, the code fails to handle certain edge cases and does not guarantee the construction of valid paths that meet all the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
