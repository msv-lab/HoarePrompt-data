Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program provided meets the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two lines of input: the first line contains `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
   - These inputs are used to construct the paths as required.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the special case where `n` is 4. According to the problem, if `n` is 4, it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, and the program prints `-1`.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - When `n` is not 4 and `k` is at least `n + 1`, the program constructs a valid path that meets the requirements:
     - It starts with `a` and `c`.
     - It then appends all other cities (from 1 to `n`) that are not `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` in ascending order.
     - It appends `b` and `d` at the end.
   - This ensures that both paths are of length `n` and start and end at the specified cities (`a` to `b` and `c` to `d`).

4. **Path Swapping**:
   - The program creates two paths, `p1` and `p2`, by swapping the last two elements of the constructed path for `p1` and the first two elements for `p2`.
   - This ensures that the paths are different and still meet the requirement of being a valid sequence of `n` distinct cities.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the two paths as space-separated strings.
   - If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because it is impossible to construct the paths with the given constraints.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 4.
- For larger `n` and sufficient `k`, it constructs valid paths that meet the problem's requirements.
- The paths are constructed such that they use at most `2n - 2` roads, which is within the allowed limit `k`.
- The program ensures that the paths are distinct and cover all cities exactly once, starting and ending at the specified cities.

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
