You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bearland has n cities, numbered 1 through n. Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.

Bear Limak was once in a city a and he wanted to go to a city b. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally: 

  * There is no road between a and b. 
  * There exists a sequence (path) of n distinct cities v1, v2, ..., vn that v1 = a, vn = b and there is a road between vi and vi + 1 for <image>. 



On the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city c and a city d. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of n distinct cities u1, u2, ..., un that u1 = c, un = d and there is a road between ui and ui + 1 for <image>.

Also, Limak thinks that there are at most k roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.

Given n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v1, ..., vn) and (u1, ..., un) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.

The second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n).

Output

Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v1, v2, ..., vn where v1 = a and vn = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u1, u2, ..., un where u1 = c and un = d.

Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v1, v2), (v2, v3), ..., (vn - 1, vn), (u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (un - 1, un). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.

Examples

Input

7 11
2 4 7 3


Output

2 7 1 3 6 5 4
7 1 5 4 6 2 3


Input

1000 999
10 20 30 40


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2, a, b, c, and d are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    if (n == 4) :
        print('-1')
    else :
        if (k >= n + 1) :
            chain = [a, c]
            for i in range(1, n + 1):
                if i not in [a, b, c, d]:
                    chain.append(i)
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, and `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik]` where `i1, i2, ..., ik` are the integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}` and are appended in ascending order.
            chain.append(b)
            chain.append(d)
            p1 = list(chain)
            p1[-1], p1[-2] = p1[-2], p1[-1]
            print(' '.join(map(str, p1)))
            p2 = list(chain)
            p2[0], p2[1] = p2[1], p2[0]
            print(' '.join(map(str, p2)))
        else :
            print('-1')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, and `n` is not equal to 4. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the list `p2` is updated such that its first element is `c` and its second element is `a`, and the string `' '.join(map(str, p2))` has been printed. If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the value `-1` has been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are integers read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d. `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input. If `n` is 4, the conditions remain as specified. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the list `p2` is updated such that its first element is `c` and its second element is `a`, and the string `' '.join(map(str, p2))` has been printed. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is less than `n + 1`, the value `-1` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input from standard input. The first line contains two integers, `n` and `k`, and the second line contains four integers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function checks if `n` is 4. If so, it prints `-1`. If `n` is not 4, it further checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`. If this condition is true, it constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, then appends all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}`, followed by `b` and `d`. It then creates two lists, `p1` and `p2`, by modifying `chain`. Specifically, `p1` swaps the last two elements of `chain`, and `p2` swaps the first two elements of `chain`. Both `p1` and `p2` are printed as space-separated strings. If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the function prints `-1`. In all cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that the appropriate output has been printed to the standard output based on the input values.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
