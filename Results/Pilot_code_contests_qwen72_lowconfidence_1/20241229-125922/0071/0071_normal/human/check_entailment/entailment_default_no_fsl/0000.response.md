Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly handle the case when `n == 4` and `k` is sufficiently large (i.e., `k >= 5`). According to the problem description, it should be possible to find paths for `n == 4` if `k >= 5`, but the program incorrectly prints `-1` for all cases when `n == 4`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 5
1 2 3 4
```
The program will output `-1`, which is incorrect because it is possible to find paths that satisfy the conditions with 5 roads. A valid solution could be:
```
1 3 4 2
3 1 2 4
```
This solution uses exactly 5 roads: (1, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 4).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this specific case properly.
