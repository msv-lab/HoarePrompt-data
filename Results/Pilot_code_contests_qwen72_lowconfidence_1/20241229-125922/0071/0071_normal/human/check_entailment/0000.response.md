Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case when `n` is 4. According to the problem statement, for `n = 4`, it should be impossible to find two distinct paths that satisfy the conditions because there are only 4 cities, and the constraints make it impossible to form the required paths without violating the conditions. However, the program incorrectly prints `-1` for all cases when `n = 4`, regardless of the value of `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 6`, which means there could potentially be enough roads to form the required paths. However, the program will output `-1` for this input, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `k < n + 1` correctly. The problem states that there should be at most `2n - 2` roads, and the program should check if `k` is sufficient to form the required paths. The current implementation only checks if `k >= n + 1`, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that the paths can be formed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 2 3 4
```
Here, `n = 5` and `k = 5`, which means there are only 5 roads available. The program will output a solution, but it may not be possible to form the required paths with only 5 roads, making the output incorrect.
