You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Bearland has n cities, numbered 1 through n. Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.

Bear Limak was once in a city a and he wanted to go to a city b. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally: 

  * There is no road between a and b. 
  * There exists a sequence (path) of n distinct cities v1, v2, ..., vn that v1 = a, vn = b and there is a road between vi and vi + 1 for <image>. 



On the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city c and a city d. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of n distinct cities u1, u2, ..., un that u1 = c, un = d and there is a road between ui and ui + 1 for <image>.

Also, Limak thinks that there are at most k roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.

Given n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v1, ..., vn) and (u1, ..., un) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.

The second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n).

Output

Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v1, v2, ..., vn where v1 = a and vn = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u1, u2, ..., un where u1 = c and un = d.

Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v1, v2), (v2, v3), ..., (vn - 1, vn), (u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (un - 1, un). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.

Examples

Input

7 11
2 4 7 3


Output

2 7 1 3 6 5 4
7 1 5 4 6 2 3


Input

1000 999
10 20 30 40


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.
