The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the integers read from the input, which are split and mapped to integers. The conditions that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, remain valid. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.**
