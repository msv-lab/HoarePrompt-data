The code snippet `print('-1')` outputs `-1` to the console. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the action of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, and `k` is less than `n + 1`. The value `-1` has been printed.**
