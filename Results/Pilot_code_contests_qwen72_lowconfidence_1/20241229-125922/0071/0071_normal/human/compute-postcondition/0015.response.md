To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 2.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- `c` is the third integer read from the input.
- `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `i` is 2.
- If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `chain` is `[a, c, 2]`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute if `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 3.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `chain`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 2.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- `c` is the third integer read from the input.
- `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `i` is 3.
- If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `chain` is `[a, c, 2]`.

State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 2, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `i` is 3, If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1, 2]`. Otherwise, `chain` is `[a, c, 2]`.**
