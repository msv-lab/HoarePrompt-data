The code snippet `p1[-1], p1[-2] = p1[-2], p1[-1]` swaps the last two elements of the list `p1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- `c` is the third integer read from the input.
- `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]` where `i1, i2, ..., ik` are the integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}` and are appended in ascending order.
- `p1` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The last element of `p1` (which was `d`) is swapped with the second-to-last element (which was `b`).
- The new last element of `p1` is `b`.
- The new second-to-last element of `p1` is `d`.

Therefore, the updated `p1` list is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, d, b]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`, `p1` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, d, b]`**.
