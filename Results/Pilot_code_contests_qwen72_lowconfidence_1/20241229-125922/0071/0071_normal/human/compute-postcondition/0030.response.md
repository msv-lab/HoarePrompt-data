Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d. `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input. If `n` is 4, the conditions remain as specified. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the list `p2` is updated such that its first element is `c` and its second element is `a`, and the string `' '.join(map(str, p2))` has been printed. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is less than `n + 1`, the value `-1` has been printed.***
