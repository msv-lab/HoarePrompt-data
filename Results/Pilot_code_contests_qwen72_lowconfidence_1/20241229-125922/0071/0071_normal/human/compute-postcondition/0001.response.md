The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from standard input using the `input` function (which is now `sys.stdin.readline`), splits the line into two parts, and converts these parts into integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and the constraint on `input` remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer read from standard input, k is an integer read from standard input, a, b, c, and d are distinct integers such that 1 â‰¤ a, b, c, d â‰¤ n and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`**.
