To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 1.
   - `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
   - `a` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `b` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `c` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
   - `n` is not equal to 4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `chain` is `[a, c]` if `i` is one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

Given the current state where `i` is 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must be at least 2.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true, so `n` must be at least 2.
- The value of `chain` will depend on whether `i` (which is now 2) is one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.

If `i` (2) is one of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` remains `[a, c]`. Otherwise, `chain` becomes `[a, c, 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 2, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `i` is 2, and `chain` is `[a, c]` if `i` is one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`.**
