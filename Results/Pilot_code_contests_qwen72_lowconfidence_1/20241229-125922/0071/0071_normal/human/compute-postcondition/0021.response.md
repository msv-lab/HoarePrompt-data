The code `p1 = list(chain)` creates a new list `p1` that is a copy of the list `chain`. The state of the program after this operation will include the new variable `p1` with its value being the same as the value of `chain`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d.
- `a` is the first integer read from the input.
- `b` is the second integer read from the input.
- `c` is the third integer read from the input.
- `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]` where `i1, i2, ..., ik` are the integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}` and are appended in ascending order.

After executing `p1 = list(chain)`, the new state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]` where `i1, i2, ..., ik` are the integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}` and are appended in ascending order, `p1` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`**.
