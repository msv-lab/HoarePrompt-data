To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will execute if the range `1` to `n + 1` contains at least one value. This means `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `k` is an integer read from standard input.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n.
   - There is no direct road between `a` and `b`, and no direct road between `c` and `d`.
   - `a` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `b` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `c` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.
   - `n` is not equal to 4.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `chain` is `[a, c]`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.
   - The initial state already specifies that `n` is an integer read from standard input, but it does not explicitly state that `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

Given these points, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 1. The other conditions remain as they are because they do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 1, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `chain` is `[a, c]`, `i` is 1**.
