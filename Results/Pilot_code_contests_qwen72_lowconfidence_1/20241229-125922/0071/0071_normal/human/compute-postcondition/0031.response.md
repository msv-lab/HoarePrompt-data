The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the given signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `n`: An integer where 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000.
- `k`: An integer where n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: Distinct integers where 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between `a` and `b`, and no direct road between `c` and `d`.

However, since the function signature does not list these parameters, we must assume that they are either defined within the function or passed in some other way (e.g., through global variables or a different method).

Given the output section is empty, we need to infer the expected return value based on the context. Typically, in problems involving roads and connections, the function might return a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met, or it might return a specific value or structure based on the input.

Since the exact output is not specified, we will describe the functionality based on the most likely scenario:

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (where `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2, and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n with no direct road between `a` and `b`, and no direct road between `c` and `d`). The function returns a value or structure based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not specified in the problem statement.**
