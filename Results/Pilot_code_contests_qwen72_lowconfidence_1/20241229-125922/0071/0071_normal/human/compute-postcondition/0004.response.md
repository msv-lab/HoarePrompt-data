The provided code snippet prints `-1` and does not modify any of the variables. The initial state includes the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since the code only performs a print operation, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 4, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 4, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input.**
