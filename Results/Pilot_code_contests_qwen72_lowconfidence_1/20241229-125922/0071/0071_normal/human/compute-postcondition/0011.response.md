Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from standard input and must be at least 1, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 â‰¤ a, b, c, d â‰¤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `i` is 1, and `chain` is `[a, c]` if `i` is one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `i` is not one of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`.***
