Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 â‰¤ a, b, c, d â‰¤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, and `n` is not equal to 4. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the list `p2` is updated such that its first element is `c` and its second element is `a`, and the string `' '.join(map(str, p2))` has been printed. If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the value `-1` has been printed.***
