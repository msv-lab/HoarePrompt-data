The code snippet assigns the value of `chain` to `p2`. Since `chain` is already defined as `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`, `p2` will now be a copy of this list. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n, and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `a` is the first integer read from the input, `b` is the second integer read from the input, `c` is the third integer read from the input, `d` is the fourth integer read from the input, `n` is not equal to 4, `chain` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`, `p1` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, d, b]`, `p2` is `[a, c, i1, i2, ..., ik, b, d]`, the string `' '.join(map(str, p1))` has been printed.**
