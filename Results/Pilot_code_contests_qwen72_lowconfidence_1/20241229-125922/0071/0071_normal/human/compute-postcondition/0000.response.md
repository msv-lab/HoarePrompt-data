The line `input = sys.stdin.readline` assigns the method `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This changes the behavior of `input` from its default (which reads input from the user) to reading a line from standard input.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) and their constraints remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2, a, b, c, and d are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n and there is no direct road between a and b, and no direct road between c and d, `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`**.
