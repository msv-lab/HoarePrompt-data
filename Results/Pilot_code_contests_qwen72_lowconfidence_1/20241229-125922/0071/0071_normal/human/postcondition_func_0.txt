The function reads two lines of input from standard input. The first line contains two integers, `n` and `k`, and the second line contains four integers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function checks if `n` is 4. If so, it prints `-1`. If `n` is not 4, it further checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`. If this condition is true, it constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, then appends all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `{a, b, c, d}`, followed by `b` and `d`. It then creates two lists, `p1` and `p2`, by modifying `chain`. Specifically, `p1` swaps the last two elements of `chain`, and `p2` swaps the first two elements of `chain`. Both `p1` and `p2` are printed as space-separated strings. If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the function prints `-1`. In all cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that the appropriate output has been printed to the standard output based on the input values.
