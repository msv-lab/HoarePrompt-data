Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the scenario where the starting and ending airports belong to different companies. The program uses a binary search approach to find the minimum cost, but it does not correctly account for the direct path between the starting and ending airports when they belong to different companies.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1 4
1010
```
According to the problem description, the minimum cost should be 1, as Vladik can fly from airport 1 to airport 2 (cost 1) and then from airport 2 to airport 4 (cost 0). However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost in this case, leading to an incorrect output.

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and thus it is incorrect.
