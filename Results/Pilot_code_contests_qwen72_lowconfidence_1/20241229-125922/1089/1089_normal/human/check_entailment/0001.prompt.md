You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vladik is a competitive programmer. This year he is going to win the International Olympiad in Informatics. But it is not as easy as it sounds: the question Vladik face now is to find the cheapest way to get to the olympiad.

Vladik knows n airports. All the airports are located on a straight line. Each airport has unique id from 1 to n, Vladik's house is situated next to the airport with id a, and the place of the olympiad is situated next to the airport with id b. It is possible that Vladik's house and the place of the olympiad are located near the same airport. 

To get to the olympiad, Vladik can fly between any pair of airports any number of times, but he has to start his route at the airport a and finish it at the airport b.

Each airport belongs to one of two companies. The cost of flight from the airport i to the airport j is zero if both airports belong to the same company, and |i - j| if they belong to different companies.

Print the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of airports, the id of the airport from which Vladik starts his route and the id of the airport which he has to reach. 

The second line contains a string with length n, which consists only of characters 0 and 1. If the i-th character in this string is 0, then i-th airport belongs to first company, otherwise it belongs to the second.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum cost Vladik has to pay to get to the olympiad.

Examples

Input

4 1 4
1010


Output

1

Input

5 5 2
10110


Output

0

Note

In the first example Vladik can fly to the airport 2 at first and pay |1 - 2| = 1 (because the airports belong to different companies), and then fly from the airport 2 to the airport 4 for free (because the airports belong to the same company). So the cost of the whole flight is equal to 1. It's impossible to get to the olympiad for free, so the answer is equal to 1. 

In the second example Vladik can fly directly from the airport 5 to the airport 2, because they belong to the same company.
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func():
    (n, s, f) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    numbers = list(map(int, list(stdin.readline().strip())))
    cnt = [0 for i in range(n)]
    s -= 1
    f -= 1
    (s, f) = (min(s, f), max(s, f))
    if numbers[0] == numbers[s]:
        cnt[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[s]:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
    ans = f - s
    if numbers[s] != numbers[f]:
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] > cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        l = -1
        r = n
        while r > l + 1:
            m = (r + l) // 2
            if cnt[m] >= cnt[f]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        if r != n:
            ans = min(ans, f - r)
    else:
        ans = 0
    stdout.write(str(ans))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
