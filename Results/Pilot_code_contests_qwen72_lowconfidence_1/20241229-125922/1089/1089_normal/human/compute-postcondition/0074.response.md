Functionality: ** The function reads two lines from standard input. The first line contains three integers: `n`, `s`, and `f`. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function processes the string `s` to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from position `s` to position `f` under certain conditions. Specifically, it calculates a cumulative count of positions in the string `s` that match the character at position `s` up to each index. If the characters at positions `s` and `f` are different, it uses binary search to find the minimum distance to a position where the cumulative count exceeds the count at position `f`. If the characters at positions `s` and `f` are the same, the result is 0. The function writes the result to standard output. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the result is 0 if the characters at `s` and `f` are the same, or the distance between `s` and `f` otherwise. **
