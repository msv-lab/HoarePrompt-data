To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input integer -1.
- `f` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
- `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the corresponding character from `f` converted to an integer.
- `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0.
- If the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`, then `cnt[0]` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `numbers` should be a list of integers derived from the string `f`.
   - `cnt` should be a list of length `n` initialized to 0.
   - The condition for `cnt[0]` being 1 depends on the first element of `numbers` and the element at index `s` of `numbers`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` should be 1.
- `numbers` should be a list of integers derived from the string `f`.
- `cnt` should be a list of length `n` initialized to 0.
- The condition for `cnt[0]` being 1 should be checked based on the first element of `numbers` and the element at index `s` of `numbers`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the string `f`, `cnt` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, if the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`, then `cnt[0]` is 1**.
