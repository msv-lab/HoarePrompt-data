The code snippet `cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1] + 1` updates the value of `cnt[i]` based on the value of `cnt[i - 1]` and adds 1 to it.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2 (since `i` is 2 and the loop condition is `i < n`).

Let's assume `cnt` is a list that has at least `i` elements, and `cnt[1]` has some value (let's denote this value as `v`). 

The code will execute as follows:
- `cnt[2]` is set to `cnt[1] + 1`.
- Since `cnt[1]` is `v`, `cnt[2]` will be `v + 1`.

The rest of the state remains the same, except for the updated value of `cnt[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `cnt[2]` is `v + 1`, where `v` is the value of `cnt[1]`**.
