The code snippet updates the value of `cnt[i]` by setting it to `cnt[i - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3
- If `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, then `cnt[2]` is `v + 1`, where `v` is the value of `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cnt[2]` is equal to `cnt[1]`

We need to determine the new value of `cnt[i]` (which is `cnt[3]` since `i` is 3).

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Identify the affected variable:** The variable `cnt[3]` is being updated.
2. **Determine the value of `cnt[i - 1]`:** Since `i` is 3, `cnt[i - 1]` is `cnt[2]`.
3. **Update the value of `cnt[3]`:** The new value of `cnt[3]` is `cnt[2] + 1`.

Given the initial state, `cnt[2]` can be either:
- `v + 1` if `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`
- `cnt[1]` otherwise

However, the exact value of `cnt[1]` is not provided, so we will use the general form.

### Output State:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3
- If `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, then `cnt[2]` is `v + 1`, where `v` is the value of `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cnt[2]` is equal to `cnt[1]`
- `cnt[3]` is `cnt[2] + 1`

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, if `numbers[i] == numbers[s]`, then `cnt[2]` is `v + 1`, where `v` is the value of `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cnt[2]` is equal to `cnt[1]`; `cnt[3]` is `cnt[2] + 1`**
