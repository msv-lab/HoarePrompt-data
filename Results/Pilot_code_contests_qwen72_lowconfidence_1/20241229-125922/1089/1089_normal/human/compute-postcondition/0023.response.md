Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer -1, `f` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the corresponding character from `f` converted to an integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the cumulative count of elements in `numbers` from index 0 to the current index `i` that are equal to `numbers[s]`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1), `cnt` remains `[1]` if `numbers[0]` equals `numbers[s]`, otherwise `cnt` remains `[0]`. For `n > 1`, the final state of `cnt` is such that each element `cnt[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the cumulative count of elements from `numbers[0]` to `numbers[i]` that are equal to `numbers[s]`.**
