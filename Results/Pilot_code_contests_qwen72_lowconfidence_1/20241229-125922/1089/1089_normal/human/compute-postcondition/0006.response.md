Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer -1, `f` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the corresponding character from `f` converted to an integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, and the first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`.***
