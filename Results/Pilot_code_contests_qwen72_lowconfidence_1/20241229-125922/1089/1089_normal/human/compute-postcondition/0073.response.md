The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. 

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a` and `b` are integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt. For the purpose of this description, I will assume that the function processes the string `s` using the indices `a` and `b` and returns a result based on some operation (since the exact operation is not specified, this part remains general).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept four parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s`, and return a result based on the processing of `s` using `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s`. It returns a result based on the processing of the string `s` using the indices `a` and `b`.**
