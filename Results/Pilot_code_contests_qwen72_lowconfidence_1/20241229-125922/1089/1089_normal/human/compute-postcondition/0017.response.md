The provided code snippet updates the value of `cnt[i]` to be equal to the value of `cnt[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 2 (so the loop condition is satisfied).
- The rest of the state remains the same.

The code snippet:
```python
cnt[i] = cnt[i - 1]
```

Impact:
- `cnt[2]` is updated to the value of `cnt[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `cnt[2]` is equal to `cnt[1]`, the rest of the state remains the same.**
