Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is -1, `f` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the corresponding character from `f` converted to an integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the cumulative count of elements in `numbers` from index 0 to the current index `i` that are equal to `numbers[s]`, the current value of `numbers[s]` is different from `numbers[f]`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `cnt[m] > cnt[f]`, then `r` is `(n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` is `(n - 1) // 2`.***
