Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `s` is an input integer -1, `f` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ a, b â‰¤ n, `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer is the corresponding character from `f` converted to an integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n` where each element represents the cumulative count of elements in `numbers` from index 0 to the current index `i` that are equal to `numbers[s]`, the current value of `numbers[s]` is different from `numbers[f]`, `l` is -1, `r` is `n`, `m` is `(n - 1) // 2`. If `cnt[m]` is greater than `cnt[f]`, `r` is updated to `m`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `m`.***
