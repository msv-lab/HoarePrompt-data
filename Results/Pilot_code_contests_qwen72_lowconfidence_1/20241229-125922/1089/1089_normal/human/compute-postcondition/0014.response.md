Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers derived from the string `f`, and `cnt` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0. If `numbers[i]` is equal to `numbers[s]`, then `cnt[1]` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt[1]` is 0. The first element of `numbers` is equal to the element at index `s` of `numbers`.***
