Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the dimensions \( H \) and \( W \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid \( a \) where \( a_{ij} \) represents the number of coins in cell \((i, j)\).

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - The program iterates through each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell contains an odd number of coins, it performs an operation to move one coin to an adjacent cell to make the current cell's count even.
   - The operations are recorded in the `result` list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If a cell is in the last column but not the last row, the program moves a coin to the cell directly below.
   - If a cell is in the last row and last column, the program does not perform any operation because there are no adjacent cells to move the coin to.

4. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program prints the number of operations performed.
   - It then prints the details of each operation in the required format.

### Key Points:

- **Correct Handling of Even and Odd Cells:**
  - The program correctly identifies cells with an odd number of coins and performs the necessary operations to make them even.
  - It ensures that each operation is valid by only moving coins to adjacent cells.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where a cell is in the last column or the last row appropriately.
  - If a cell is in the last row and last column, it does not attempt to move a coin, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the required format exactly, printing the number of operations followed by the details of each operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
