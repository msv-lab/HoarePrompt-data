Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the last cell in the last row (i.e., the bottom-right corner cell) has an odd number of coins. According to the problem description, if a cell has an odd number of coins, it should be possible to move one coin to an adjacent cell to make the number of coins even. However, the code does not check this specific case, and thus, it may leave the last cell with an odd number of coins, which violates the requirement to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 2
2 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
1 1 1 2
2 2 2 1
```

However, the provided code will only output:
```
1
1 1 1 2
```

This leaves the bottom-right cell (2, 2) with an odd number of coins, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for every potential case.
