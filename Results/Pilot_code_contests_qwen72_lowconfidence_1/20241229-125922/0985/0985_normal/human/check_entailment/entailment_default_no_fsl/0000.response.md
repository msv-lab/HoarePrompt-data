Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when the last cell in the last row is odd. According to the problem description, the operation should ensure that the maximum number of cells contain an even number of coins. However, the current implementation skips the last cell in the last row if it is odd, as there is no adjacent cell to move the coin to. This results in a suboptimal solution where the number of cells with an even number of coins is not maximized.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1 1
1
```
The output should be:
```
0
```
However, the program will not perform any operations and will leave the cell with an odd number of coins, which is not optimal.

Another example:
```
2 2
1 1
1 1
```
The optimal solution would involve moving coins to ensure all cells have an even number of coins:
```
2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
```
However, the program will only perform one operation and leave the last cell with an odd number of coins, which is not optimal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
