Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the last cell (i.e., the bottom-right corner cell) has an odd number of coins. According to the problem description, the operation cannot be performed on a cell that has already been chosen. However, the current implementation does not address this scenario, leading to an incorrect solution.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 2
1 1
1 1
```

The expected output would be to move coins to make as many cells as possible have an even number of coins. However, the program does not provide a valid sequence of moves for this input, as it cannot move the coin from the last cell (2,2) because it has no adjacent cells to move to. This results in an incorrect solution.
