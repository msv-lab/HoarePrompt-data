Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the grid has only one row and one column (i.e., H = 1 and W = 1). In such a scenario, the program attempts to move coins to a non-existent adjacent cell, which violates the problem constraints. Specifically, the condition `elif j + 1 == W and i + 1 < H` fails when there is only one cell, leading to no operation being performed, even though the problem requires maximizing the number of cells with an even number of coins. For example, if the input is:

```
1 1
1
```

The program will not perform any operation, leaving the cell with an odd number of coins, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
