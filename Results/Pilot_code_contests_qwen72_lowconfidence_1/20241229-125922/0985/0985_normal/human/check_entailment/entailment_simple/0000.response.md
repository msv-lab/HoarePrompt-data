Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Even Numbers**: The program attempts to make all numbers in the grid even by moving coins. However, it only handles the case where a cell contains an odd number of coins by moving one coin to an adjacent cell. It does not consider the possibility of making an already even number of coins in a cell. This is not a major issue as the goal is to maximize the number of cells with even coins, and moving an odd number to an even number helps achieve this.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the last column of a row has an odd number of coins by moving a coin to the next row. However, it fails to handle the case where the last cell in the entire grid (bottom-right corner) has an odd number of coins. In this case, there is no adjacent cell to move the coin to, which would result in an incorrect output.

3. **Output Format**: The program's output format is mostly correct, but it uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, which is specific to Python 2. The problem description implies that the program should work with Python 3, so using `input()` would be more appropriate.

4. **Final State Verification**: The program does not verify that the final state of the grid has the maximum number of cells with even coins. While the logic seems to aim for this, it is not guaranteed to always produce the optimal solution, especially in edge cases.

### Example of a Failing Case:
Consider the following input:
```
2 2
1 1
1 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
```
However, the given program will only output:
```
2
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 2
```
But it fails to handle the case where the last cell (2, 2) still has an odd number of coins, which cannot be moved anywhere.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly the edge case where the last cell in the grid has an odd number of coins. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
