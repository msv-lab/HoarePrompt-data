You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is a grid of square cells with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. The cell at the i-th row and the j-th column will be denoted as Cell (i, j).

In Cell (i, j), a_{ij} coins are placed.

You can perform the following operation any number of times:

Operation: Choose a cell that was not chosen before and contains one or more coins, then move one of those coins to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell.

Maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq H, W \leq 500
* 0 \leq a_{ij} \leq 9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


H W
a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1W}
a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2W}
:
a_{H1} a_{H2} ... a_{HW}


Output

Print a sequence of operations that maximizes the number of cells containing an even number of coins, in the following format:


N
y_1 x_1 y_1' x_1'
y_2 x_2 y_2' x_2'
:
y_N x_N y_N' x_N'


That is, in the first line, print an integer N between 0 and H \times W (inclusive), representing the number of operations.

In the (i+1)-th line (1 \leq i \leq N), print four integers y_i, x_i, y_i' and x_i' (1 \leq y_i, y_i' \leq H and 1 \leq x_i, x_i' \leq W), representing the i-th operation. These four integers represents the operation of moving one of the coins placed in Cell (y_i, x_i) to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell, (y_i', x_i').

Note that if the specified operation violates the specification in the problem statement or the output format is invalid, it will result in Wrong Answer.
