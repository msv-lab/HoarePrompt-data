Postcondition: ***`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions, `j` is 1. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1` and `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] + 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` or `result`.***
