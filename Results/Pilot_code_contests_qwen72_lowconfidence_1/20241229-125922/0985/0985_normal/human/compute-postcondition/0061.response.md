The code appends a list to `result` which contains the values `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500. Therefore, the list appended to `result` is `[2, 1, 3, 1]`.

The values of `H`, `i`, `W`, `a`, `j`, and the condition `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`, `j` is 0, `j + 1 == W`, `i + 1 < H`.**
