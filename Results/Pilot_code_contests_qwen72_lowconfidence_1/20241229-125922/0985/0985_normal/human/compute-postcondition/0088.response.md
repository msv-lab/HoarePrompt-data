Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even, `j` is 2. If `a[1][2]` is even, the state remains unchanged. If `a[1][2]` is odd, and if `j + 1 < W`, `a[1][2]` is decremented by 1, `a[1][3]` is incremented by 1, and `result` includes the additional operation `[2, 3, 2, 4]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[1][2]` is decremented by 1, `a[2][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` includes the additional operation `[2, 3, 3, 3]`.***
