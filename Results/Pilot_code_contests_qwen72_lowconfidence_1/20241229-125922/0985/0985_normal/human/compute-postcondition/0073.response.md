The value of `a[i][j]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the element at position `a[1][1]` is reduced by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` includes `[2, 2, 3, 2]`, `j` is 1, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] - 1`.**
