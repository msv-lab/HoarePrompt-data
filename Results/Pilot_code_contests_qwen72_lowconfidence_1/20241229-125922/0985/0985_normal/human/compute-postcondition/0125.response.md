The value of `a[i + 1][j]` is incremented by 1. Given `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the element `a[3][2]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 2, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[2][2]` is decreased by 1, `a[3][2]` is increased by 1, `j` is 2, `result` contains the additional list `[3, 3, 4, 3]`**
