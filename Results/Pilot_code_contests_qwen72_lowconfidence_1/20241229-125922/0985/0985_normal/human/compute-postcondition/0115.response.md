Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 < W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `j` is 1, and `W` must be greater than 1. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, the specific operations within the if block are executed.***
