The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2]` to the `result` list. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are both 1, so the list `[2, 2, 2, 3]` is appended to `result`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` now contains the original operations plus `[2, 2, 2, 3]`, and `j` is 1.**
