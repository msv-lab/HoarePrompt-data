The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2]` to the `result` list. Given the initial values of `i` and `j`, we can calculate the new list being appended.

- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3 and `j + 2` is 4.

Therefore, the list `[3, 3, 3, 4]` is appended to `result`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `result` now contains the additional element `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.**
