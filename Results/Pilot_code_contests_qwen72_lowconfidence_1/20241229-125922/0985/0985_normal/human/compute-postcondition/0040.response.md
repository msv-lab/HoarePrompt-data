The code appends a new list to `result`. The new list is constructed as follows: the first element is `i + 1` (which is `0 + 1 = 1`), the second element is `j + 1` (which is `2 + 1 = 3`), the third element is `i + 1` again (which is `1`), and the fourth element is `j + 2` (which is `2 + 2 = 4`). Therefore, the list `[1, 3, 1, 4]` is appended to `result`.

The values of `H`, `i`, `W`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `result` list.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 1, 4]]`**
