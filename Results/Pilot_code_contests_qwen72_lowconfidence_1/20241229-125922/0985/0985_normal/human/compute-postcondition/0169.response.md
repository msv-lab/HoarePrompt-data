The code snippet `print(result[i][j]),` prints the element located at the position `result[2][0]` (since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0). The values of `i`, `j`, and the structure of `result` remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 1 element, `j` is 0, and `j` is not equal to the length of `result[2]` minus 1**
