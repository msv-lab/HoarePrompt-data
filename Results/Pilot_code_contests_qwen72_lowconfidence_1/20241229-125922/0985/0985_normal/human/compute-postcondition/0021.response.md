The code snippet `result.append([i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1])` appends a new list to `result`. The elements of this new list are calculated based on the current values of `i` and `j`. Given the initial conditions:

- `i` is 0
- `j + 1` is equal to `W`
- `i + 1` is less than `H`

The appended list will be `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]`, which translates to `[1, W, 2, W]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the program is:
- `H` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[i][j] % 2 != 0`
- `j + 1` is equal to `W`
- `i + 1` is less than `H`
- `result` is now a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]`

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[i][j] % 2 != 0`, `j + 1` is equal to `W`, `i + 1` is less than `H`, `result` is a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]`**
