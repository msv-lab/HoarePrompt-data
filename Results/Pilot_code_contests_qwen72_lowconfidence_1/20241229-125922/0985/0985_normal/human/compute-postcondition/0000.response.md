The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `H` and `W`. Since the initial state specifies that `H` and `W` are integers within the range 1 to 500, the new values of `H` and `W` will also be within this range. The rest of the initial state, which specifies the constraints on `a_{ij}`, remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500 (values read from input), `a_{ij}` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W.**
