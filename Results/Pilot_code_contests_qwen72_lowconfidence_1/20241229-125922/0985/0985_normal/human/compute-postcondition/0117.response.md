Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 < W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers. If `a[1][1]` is even, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) remain even, and `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even. If `a[1][1]` is odd, `a[1][1]` is decremented by 1, and if `j + 1 < W`, then `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1, making it an odd number, and `result` now includes `[3, 2, 3, 3]`. If `j + 1 == W`, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) remain even except for `a[1][1]`, which is decremented by 1, and `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even. In both cases, `j` is 1, and `W` must be greater than 1.***
