The code appends a list to `result`. This list is calculated using the current values of `i` and `j`. Specifically, the list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]` is appended to `result`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2

The new list to be appended is:
- `[2 + 1, 2 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1]` which simplifies to `[3, 3, 4, 3]`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `H` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `W` must be greater than 2
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `j` is 2
- `result` now contains the additional list `[3, 3, 4, 3]`

Output State: **`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `result` contains the additional list `[3, 3, 4, 3]`**
