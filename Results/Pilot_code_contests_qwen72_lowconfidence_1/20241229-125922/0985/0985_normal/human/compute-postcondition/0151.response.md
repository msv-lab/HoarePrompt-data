The code `print(result[i][j])` prints the value located at `result[1][j]`, where `j` is the length of `result[1]` minus 1. This means it prints the last element of the list `result[1]`. The variables `i`, `result`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, `result[1]` has at least one element, `j` is equal to the length of `result[1]` minus 1**
