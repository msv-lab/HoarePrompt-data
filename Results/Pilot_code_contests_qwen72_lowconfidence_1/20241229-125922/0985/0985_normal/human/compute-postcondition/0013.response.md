The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, in the context provided, no loop is explicitly shown, so we assume this `continue` is part of a larger loop structure that is not visible in the given snippet. As such, the `continue` statement itself does not alter the values of any variables directly.

Given the initial state:
- `H` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `result` is an empty list
- The current value of `a[i][j]` is even

The `continue` statement only affects the flow control within a loop, causing the next iteration of the loop to start immediately. Since no loop is shown, and the `continue` statement does not change any variable values, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is an empty list, and the current value of `a[i][j]` is even.**
