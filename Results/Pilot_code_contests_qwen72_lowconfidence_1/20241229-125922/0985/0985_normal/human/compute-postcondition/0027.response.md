To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the loop structure:

### Given:
- `H` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `result` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(W):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Conditions:
- If `a[i][j]` is even, the state remains unchanged.
- If `a[i][j]` is odd and `j + 1` is less than `W`, then `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`.
- If `a[i][j]` is odd, `j + 1` equals `W`, and `i + 1` is less than `H`, then `a[i + 1][j]` is an odd number, and `result` is `[1, W, 2, W]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `H` > 0
   - `i` = 0
   - `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
   - `a` is a list of `H` lists, each with `W` integers
   - `result` is an empty list

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `W - 1`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < W`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `a[i][j]` is even, no changes are made, and `j` is incremented.
   - If `a[i][j]` is odd and `j + 1` is less than `W`, `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented, and `result` is updated.
   - If `a[i][j]` is odd, `j + 1` equals `W`, and `i + 1` is less than `H`, `a[i + 1][j]` is incremented, and `result` is updated.

### Final State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue if `j < W`.

### Adjusted State:
- `H` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `result` is an empty list or contains the updated values based on the conditions.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `1`.

State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is an empty list or contains the updated values based on the conditions, `j` is 1**.
