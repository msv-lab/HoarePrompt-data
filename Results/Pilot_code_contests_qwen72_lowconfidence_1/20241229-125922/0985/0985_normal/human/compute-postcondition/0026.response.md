Postcondition: ***`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, and `result` is an empty list. If `a[i][j]` is even, the state remains unchanged. If `a[i][j]` is odd and `j + 1` is less than `W`, then `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`. If `a[i][j]` is odd, `j + 1` equals `W`, and `i + 1` is less than `H`, then `a[i + 1][j]` is an odd number, and `result` is `[1, W, 2, W]`.***
