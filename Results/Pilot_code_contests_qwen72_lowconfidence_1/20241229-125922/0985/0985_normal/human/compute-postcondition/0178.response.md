Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 3 elements, and the value at `result[2][1]` has been printed. If `j` is equal to `len(result[i]) - 1`, the value at `result[2][2]` has also been printed. Otherwise, the values at `result[2][1]` and `result[2][2]` have been printed.***
