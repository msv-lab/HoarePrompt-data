Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even, and `j` is 0. If `a[i][j]` is even, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `a[i][j]` is odd, `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1. If `j + 1 < W`, `a[1][1]` is increased by 1 and `result` includes the new operation `[2, 1, 2, 2]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `result` includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]` and `a[2][0]` is increased by 1.***
