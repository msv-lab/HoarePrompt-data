The value of `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1, so `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[1][1]` is decreased by 1, `a[1][2]` is increased by 1, `result` now contains the original operations plus `[2, 2, 2, 3]`, and `j` is 1.**
