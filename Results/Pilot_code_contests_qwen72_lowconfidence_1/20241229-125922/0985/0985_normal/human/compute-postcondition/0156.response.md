The code snippet `print(result[i][j])` prints the element located at the position `result[i][j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 but must be less than `len(result[1])`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 before this line, `j` must be at least 1 and less than `len(result[1])`.

The value of `result[1][j]` is printed, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `result[1]`. However, we know that `j` has been incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, and `result[1]` has at least one element. `j` is incremented by 1 and is now 1 or more, but still less than `len(result[1])`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, and `result[1]` has at least one element. `j` is incremented by 1 and is now 1 or more, but still less than `len(result[1])`.**
