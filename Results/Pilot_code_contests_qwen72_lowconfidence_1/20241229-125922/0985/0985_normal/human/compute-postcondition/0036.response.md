Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, and `j` is 1. If `j + 1 < W`, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1`, `a[0][2]` is `a[0][2] + 1`, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1`, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] + 1`, and `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `result`.***
