Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, and `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even. If `j + 1 < W`, `a[1][1]` is decreased by 1, `a[1][2]` is increased by 1, `result` now contains the original operations plus `[2, 2, 2, 3]`, and `j` remains 1. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `result` includes `[2, 2, 3, 2]`, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] - 1`, and `a[2][1]` is `a[2][1] + 1`.***
