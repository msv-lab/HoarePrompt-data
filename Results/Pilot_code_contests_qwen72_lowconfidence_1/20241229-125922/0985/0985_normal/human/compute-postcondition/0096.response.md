The line of code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2]` to the `result` list. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `j` is 0, so `j + 1` is 1 and `j + 2` is 2.

Therefore, the list `[3, 1, 3, 2]` is appended to `result`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged, but the new element is added to `result`. The output state reflects this change:

Output State: **`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `result` now contains the original series of operations plus `[3, 1, 3, 2]`, `j` is 0, `W` must be greater than 0, the element `a[i][j]` is odd, and `j + 1` is less than `W`.**
