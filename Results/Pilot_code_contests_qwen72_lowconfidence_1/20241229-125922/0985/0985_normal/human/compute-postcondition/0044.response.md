The code snippet `a[i][j] = a[i][j] - 1` decrements the value of `a[0][2]` by 1, because `i` is 0 and `j` is 2.

Given the initial state:
- `H` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `j` is 2
- `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1 (this remains unchanged)
- `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1 (this will now be decremented by 1)
- `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`

After executing the code:
- `a[0][2]` is decremented by 1, so its new value is the original value of `a[0][2]` minus 1.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is the original value of `a[0][2]` minus 1, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`**
