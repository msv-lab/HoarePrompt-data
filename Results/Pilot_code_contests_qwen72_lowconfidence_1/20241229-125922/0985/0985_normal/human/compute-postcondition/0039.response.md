The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement has no effect on the state of the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`**
