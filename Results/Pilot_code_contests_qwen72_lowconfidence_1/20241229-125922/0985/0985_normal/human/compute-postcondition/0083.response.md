The code appends a new list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]` to the `result` list. Given the initial values of `i` and `j`, the new list appended is `[2, 3, 3, 3]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains a series of operations including `[2, 3, 3, 3]` to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even, `j` is 2**.
