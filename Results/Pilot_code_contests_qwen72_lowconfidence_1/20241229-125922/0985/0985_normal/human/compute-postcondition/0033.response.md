The value of `a[i][j]` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the element at position `[0][1]` in the list `a` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions, `j` is 1, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1`.**
