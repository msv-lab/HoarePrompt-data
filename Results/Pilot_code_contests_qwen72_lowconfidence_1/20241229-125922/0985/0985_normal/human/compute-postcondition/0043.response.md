The code snippet appends a new list to the `result` list. The new list contains the values `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so the new list being appended is `[1, 3, 2, 3]`.

Therefore, the `result` list, which initially was `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, now becomes `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`**
