To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions specified in the loop.

### Given State:
- `H` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `j` is 1.
- If `a[0][1]` is even, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
- Otherwise, if `j + 1 < W`, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`.
- If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[1][1]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions.
- If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `result`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(W):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**:
   - `H` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
   - `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `a[0][1]` is either even or odd (we need to consider both cases).

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Conditions to Check**:
   - If `a[0][1]` is even, the current iteration is skipped, and the state remains the same except for `j`.
   - If `a[0][1]` is odd:
     - If `j + 1 < W` (which is true since `j` is 1 and `W` is at least 2), then `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`.
     - If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H` (not applicable here since `j + 1` is 2 and `W` is at least 2), then `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[1][1]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions.
     - If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `result`.

### Adjusted State:
Since `j` is 1 and will be incremented to 2, and assuming `a[0][1]` is odd (since we need to consider the most general case where the loop continues):

- `j` will be 2.
- `a[0][1]` will be decremented by 1.
- `a[0][2]` will be incremented by 1.
- `result` will be `[1, 2, 1, 3]`.

### Final State:
State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`**.
