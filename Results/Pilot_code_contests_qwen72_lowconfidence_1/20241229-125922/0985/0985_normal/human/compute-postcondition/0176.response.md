The code snippet `print(result[i][j])` will print the value located at the index `[2][2]` in the `result` list since `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. The value at `result[2][1]` has already been printed, so this is a separate print operation.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, the value at `result[2][1]` has been printed, and the value at `result[2][2]` has been printed.**
