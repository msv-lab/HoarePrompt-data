The code `a[i + 1][j] = a[i + 1][j] + 1` increments the value at `a[i + 1][j]` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `H` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`
- `j` is 0
- `j + 1 == W`
- `i + 1 < H`
- `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `i + 1` is 2 (since `i` is 1)
- `j` is 0
- The value at `a[2][0]` is incremented by 1.

Since `a[1][0]` was previously decreased by 1, and now `a[2][0]` is increased by 1, the final state of these specific elements is updated accordingly.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `H` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`
- `j` is 0
- `j + 1 == W`
- `i + 1 < H`
- `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1
- `a[2][0]` is increased by 1

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`, `j` is 0, `j + 1 == W`, `i + 1 < H`, `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1, `a[2][0]` is increased by 1**
