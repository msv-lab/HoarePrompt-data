The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]` to the `result` list. Given the initial state, we can determine the specific values of `i` and `j`:

- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 1.

Thus, the list appended to `result` will be `[2 + 1, 1 + 1, 2 + 2, 1 + 1]`, which simplifies to `[3, 2, 4, 2]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 < W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `j` is 1, and `W` must be greater than 1, `result` includes `[3, 2, 4, 2]`.**
