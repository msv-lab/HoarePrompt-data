The code `print(result[i][j])` prints the value located at the index `[i][j]` of the `result` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the code will print the value at `result[2][1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the structure of `result` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and the value at `result[2][1]` has been printed.**
