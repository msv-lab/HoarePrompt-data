The code snippet `a[i + 1][j] = a[i + 1][j] + 1` increments the value at `a[i + 1][j]` by 1. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `a[i + 1][j]` translates to `a[1][2]`.

Thus, the value at `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged:
- `H` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `j` is 2.
- `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1.
- `a[0][2]` is the original value of `a[0][2]` minus 1.
- `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is the original value of `a[0][2]` minus 1, `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`.**
