According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `H`. For the loop to execute, `H` must be at least 1. The other variables (`W`, `a_{ij}`, `a`, `result`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they are part of the initial state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `H` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a_{ij}` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W, `a` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
