The value of `a[i][j]` is decremented by 1. Since `a[i][j] % 2 != 0` initially, `a[i][j]` was an odd number. After decrementing by 1, `a[i][j]` becomes an even number. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`, `a[i][j]` is an even number, and `j + 1` is less than `W`.**
