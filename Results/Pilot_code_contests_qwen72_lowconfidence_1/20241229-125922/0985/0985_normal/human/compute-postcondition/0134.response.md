Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, where all elements in `a` are even, `result` is a list with at least one element, and the length of `result` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `result[0]` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `j` is equal to the length of `result[0]` minus 1***
