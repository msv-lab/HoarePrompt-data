To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `i` is 1
- `result` has at least 2 elements
- `result[1]` has at least one element
- `j` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `len(result[1])`
- If `j` equals `len(result[i]) - 1`, then `j` is now 1 or more, but still less than `len(result[1])`. Otherwise, the value of `result[1][j]` is printed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(result[i])):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `len(result[i]) - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` is now `1` (since it was `0` at the start of the previous iteration).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(result[1])`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 1
- `result` still has at least 2 elements
- `result[1]` still has at least one element
- `j` is now 1, and it must be less than `len(result[1])` for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, `result[1]` has at least two elements, `j` is 1**
