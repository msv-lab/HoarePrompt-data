Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers. If `j + 1` equals `W` and `i + 1` is less than `H`, then `a[i][j]` is now even, `a[i + 1][j]` is now odd, and `result` is a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]`.***
