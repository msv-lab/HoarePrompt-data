The code snippet `a[i + 1][j] = a[i + 1][j] + 1` increments the value of the element located at the position `(i + 1, j)` in the 2D list `a` by 1. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `H` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 0 (unchanged).
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500 (unchanged).
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers (unchanged structure, but one element is modified).
- `a[i][j]` is now even (unchanged).
- `j + 1` is equal to `W` (unchanged, so `j = W - 1`).
- `i + 1` is less than `H` (unchanged, so `i + 1` is within bounds).
- `result` is a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]` (unchanged).

The element `a[i + 1][j]` (which is `a[1][W-1]`) is incremented by 1. Since `a[i + 1][j]` was originally an even number (because `a[i][j]` is even and `i + 1` is the next row), incrementing it by 1 makes it odd.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `H` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `a[i][j]` is now even.
- `j + 1` is equal to `W`.
- `i + 1` is less than `H`.
- `a[i + 1][j]` is now odd.
- `result` is a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]`.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[i][j]` is now even, `j + 1` is equal to `W`, `i + 1` is less than `H`, `a[i + 1][j]` is now odd, `result` is a list containing the element `[1, W, 2, W]`**
