Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, where all elements in `a` are even, `result` is a list with at least one element, and the length of `result` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `result[0]` is a non-empty list, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` is the value from the end of the previous iteration), and `j` is less than the length of `result[0]`. If `j` is equal to the last index of `result[0]`, the last element of `result[0]` has been printed. Otherwise, `j` is not equal to the last index of `result[0]`, and the element `result[0][j]` has been printed. If `j` was equal to the last index of `result[0]` before the execution, the last element of `result[0]` has been printed.***
