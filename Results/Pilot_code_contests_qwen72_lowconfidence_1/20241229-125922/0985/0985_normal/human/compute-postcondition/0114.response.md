**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Initial State**:
   - `H` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `W` is an integer such that 1 < W ≤ 500.
   - `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
   - All elements in the second row (`a[1]`) except `a[1][1]` are even.
   - `a[1][1]` is an odd number.
   - `result` includes `[3, 2, 4, 2]`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `W` must be greater than 1.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The element at `a[i + 1][j]` (third row, second column) is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
   - Given `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3.
   - Therefore, the element at `a[3][1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The element at `a[3][1]` is now `a[3][1] + 1`.
   - The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
**`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 < W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) except `a[1][1]` are even, `a[1][1]` is an odd number, `a[3][1]` is `a[3][1] + 1`, `result` includes `[3, 2, 4, 2]`, `j` is 1, and `W` must be greater than 1.**
