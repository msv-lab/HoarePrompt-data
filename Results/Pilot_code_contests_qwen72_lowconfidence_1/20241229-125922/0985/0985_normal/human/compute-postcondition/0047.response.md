Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is back to its original value, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`. If `j + 1 < W`, then `a[0][3]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 1, 4]]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, then `a[0][2]` is the original value of `a[0][2]` minus 1, `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is updated to `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 2, 3]]`.***
