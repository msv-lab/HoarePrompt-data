Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a 2D array (matrix) of dimensions H x W from user input, where H and W are integers such that 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and each element \(a_{ij}\) is an integer such that 0 ≤ \(a_{ij}\) ≤ 9. It processes the matrix to ensure all elements are even by performing the following operations: If an element is odd, it either increments the adjacent element to the right or below (if possible) and decrements itself to make it even. The function then prints the number of operations performed and the details of each operation. The final state of the program is that the matrix `a` contains only even numbers, and the operations performed are printed to the console. If the matrix is empty (i.e., H or W is 0), no operations are performed, and the function prints 0. **
