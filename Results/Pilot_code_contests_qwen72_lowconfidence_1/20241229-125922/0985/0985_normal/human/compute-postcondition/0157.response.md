The code prints the element located at `result[i][j]`. Given that `i` is 1, and `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(result[1])`, the value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the element at `result[1][j]` is printed. Since the code only prints a value and does not modify `result`, `i`, or explicitly change `j` beyond incrementing it, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, and `result[1]` has at least one element, `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `result[1][j]` is printed.**
