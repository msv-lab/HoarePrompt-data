The code appends a new list to `a`, where the new list contains integers from user input split by spaces. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing three lists of integers, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
