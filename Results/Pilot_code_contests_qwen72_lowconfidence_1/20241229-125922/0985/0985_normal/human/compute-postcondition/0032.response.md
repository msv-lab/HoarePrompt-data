The code snippet `result.append([i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1])` appends a new list to the `result` list. This new list is `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 2, j + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the expression evaluates to `[1, 2, 2, 2]`. Therefore, the `result` list, which was initially empty or contained some values, now includes this new list.

The values of `H`, `i`, `W`, `a`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `result` list.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions, `j` is 1**
