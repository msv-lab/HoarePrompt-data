Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `j` is 0, `W` must be greater than 0, and the element `a[2][0]` is even. If `j + 1` is less than `W`, then `a[2][1]` is incremented by 1, `result` now contains the original series of operations plus `[3, 1, 3, 2]`, and `a[i][j]` is even. If `j + 1` is not less than `W` (i.e., `j + 1` equals `W`), and `i + 1` is less than `H`, then `result` contains `[3, 1, 4, 1]`, `a[2][0]` is even, `a[3][0]` is incremented by 1, and `j` remains 0.***
