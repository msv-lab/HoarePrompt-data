The code snippet `print(result[i][j])` accesses and prints the value located at the position `result[2][j]`. Given that `j` is equal to the length of `result[2]` minus 1, `j` points to the last element in the list `result[2]`. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `result`, `j`, or any other variables, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 1 element, `j` is 0, and `j` is equal to the length of `result[2]` minus 1, the value of `result[2][j]` is printed.**
