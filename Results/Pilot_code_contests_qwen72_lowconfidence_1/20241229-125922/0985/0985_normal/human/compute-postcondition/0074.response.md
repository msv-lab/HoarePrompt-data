The value of `a[i + 1][j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, this means `a[2][1]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `a[1][1]` was `a[1][1] - 1`, but this does not affect `a[2][1]`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` includes `[2, 2, 3, 2]`, `j` is 1, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] - 1`, `a[2][1]` is `a[2][1] + 1`.**
