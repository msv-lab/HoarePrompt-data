- Initial State:
  - `H` is greater than 0
  - `i` is 0
  - `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
  - `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
  - `j` is 2
  - `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1
  - `a[0][2]` is back to its original value
  - `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 1, 4]]`

- Impact of the code:
  - `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented by 1
  - `i` is 0, `j` is 2, so `a[0][3]` is incremented by 1

- Updated State:
  - `a[0][3]` is incremented by 1

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is back to its original value, `a[0][3]` is incremented by 1, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, [1, 3, 1, 4]]`**
