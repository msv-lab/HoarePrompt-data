Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, where all elements in `a` are even, `result` is a list with at least one element, and the length of `result` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is equal to the length of `result[i]` minus 1, then `j` remains as `len(result[i]) - 1`. Otherwise, `j` is less than the length of `result[0]`.***
