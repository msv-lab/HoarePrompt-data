Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers. `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even. For each odd element in `a[0]` at index `j` (where `0 ≤ j < W`), if `j + 1 < W`, then `a[0][j]` is decremented by 1 and `a[0][j + 1]` is incremented by 1, and the operation `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]` is appended to `result`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, then `a[0][j]` is decremented by 1 and `a[1][j]` is incremented by 1, and the operation `[1, W, 2, W]` is appended to `result`. If the loop does not execute, `result` remains an empty list.**
