The code snippet `print(result[i][j])` prints the element located at the position `[i][j]` in the `result` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `j` is the length of `result[0]` minus 1, which means `j` points to the last element of the first list within `result`.

Since `result[0]` is a non-empty list, and `j` is set to the index of its last element, the code will print the last element of the first list in `result`. The values of `H`, `W`, and `a` are not affected by this operation, nor are the lengths of `result` or `result[0]` altered.

Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the action of printing the specified element. Here is the detailed output state:

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, where all elements in `a` are even, `result` is a list with at least one element, and the length of `result` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `result[0]` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `j` is equal to the length of `result[0]` minus 1, the last element of `result[0]` has been printed.**
