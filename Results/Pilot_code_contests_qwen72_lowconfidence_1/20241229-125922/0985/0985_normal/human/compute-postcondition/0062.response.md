The code snippet `a[i][j] = a[i][j] - 1` modifies the element at the position `[i][j]` in the list `a` by decrementing its value by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is the element `a[i][j]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`, `j` is 0, `j + 1 == W`, `i + 1 < H`, `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1.**
