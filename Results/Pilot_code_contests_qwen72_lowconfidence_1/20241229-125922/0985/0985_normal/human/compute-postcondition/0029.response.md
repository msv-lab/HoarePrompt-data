The code snippet `result.append([i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2])` modifies the `result` list by appending a new list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2]`. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are used in this operation:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1

Therefore, the new list appended to `result` is calculated as follows:
- `i + 1` is 0 + 1 = 1
- `j + 1` is 1 + 1 = 2
- `i + 1` is again 1
- `j + 2` is 1 + 2 = 3

So, the list `[1, 2, 1, 3]` is appended to `result`.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is now `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, `j` is 1**
