Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even, `j` is 0, and `a[i][j] % 2 != 0`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `result` now includes the operation `[2, 1, 3, 1]`, `a[1][0]` is decreased by 1, and `a[2][0]` is increased by 1.***
