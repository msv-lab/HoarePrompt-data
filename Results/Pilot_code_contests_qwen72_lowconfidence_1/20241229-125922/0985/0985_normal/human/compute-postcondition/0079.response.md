The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control.

Given the initial state:
- `H` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers
- `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even
- `j` is 2

The `continue` statement only affects the flow control and does not modify the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains a series of operations performed to adjust the elements of `a` such that all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) are even, `j` is 2**
