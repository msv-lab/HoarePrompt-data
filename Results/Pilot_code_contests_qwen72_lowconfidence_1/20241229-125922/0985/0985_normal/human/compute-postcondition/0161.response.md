The code `print(result[i][j])` prints the value located at the index `[i][j]` of the `result` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, so the code will print the value `result[1][1]`. No variables are modified by this code, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, `result[1]` has at least two elements, `j` is 1**
