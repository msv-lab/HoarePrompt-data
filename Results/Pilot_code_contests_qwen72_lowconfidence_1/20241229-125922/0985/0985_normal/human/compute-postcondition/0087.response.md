Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` contains operations to make all elements in the first row (`a[0]`) even. `j` is 2. If `j + 1 < W`, `a[1][2]` is `a[1][2] - 1`, `a[1][3]` is `a[1][3] + 1`, and `result` includes the additional operation `[2, 3, 2, 4]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[1][2]` is `a[1][2] - 1`, `a[2][2]` is `a[2][2] + 1`, and `result` includes the additional operation `[2, 3, 3, 3]`.***
