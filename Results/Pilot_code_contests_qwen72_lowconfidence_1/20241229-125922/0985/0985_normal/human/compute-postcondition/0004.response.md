The code snippet `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and appends the resulting list of integers to the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500
- `a_{ij}` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W
- `a` is an empty list
- `result` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

After executing the code:
- `a` is no longer an empty list; it now contains one element, which is a list of integers read from the input. The length of this list is equal to the number of integers inputted, which should be consistent with the value of `W` (since `W` defines the width of the grid).
- The other variables (`H`, `W`, `result`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing a single list of integers, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
