Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, and `result[1]` has at least one element. `j` is incremented by 1 and remains less than `len(result[1])`. If `j` equals `len(result[i]) - 1`, then `j` is now 1 or more, but still less than `len(result[1])`. Otherwise, the value of `result[1][j]` is printed.***
