The code `print(result[i][j]),` prints the value located at `result[i][j]` without changing any of the variables involved. The values of `i`, `result`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, `result[1]` has at least one element, and `j` is not equal to `len(result[1]) - 1`**
