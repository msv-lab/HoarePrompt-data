The code initializes an empty list `a`. This does not affect the values of `H` and `W`, nor the values of `a_{ij}`. The only change is the initialization of `a`.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500 (values read from input), `a_{ij}` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W, `a` is an empty list.**
