The value of `a[i][j]` is decremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so the element `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1`, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, `j` is 1**
