To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500.
- `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` is a list containing two lists of integers.
- `result` is an empty list.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(H):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `H`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `H`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.
- Ensure that `H` is still greater than the new value of `i` (which is 2).

### Updated State:
- `H` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500.
- `W` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` remains a list containing two lists of integers.
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `i` is now 2.

### Final State:
State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 2**.
