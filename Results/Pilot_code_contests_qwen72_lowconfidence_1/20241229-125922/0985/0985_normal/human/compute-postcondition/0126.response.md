Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is greater than 2, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `j` is 2, and the state of `a[1]` and `result` remains as described in the given state. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, then `a[2][2]` is decreased by 1, `a[3][2]` is increased by 1, and `result` contains the additional list `[3, 3, 4, 3]`.***
