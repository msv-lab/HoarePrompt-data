The code `print(result[i][j])` prints the value located at the index `[2][1]` in the list `result`. This operation does not alter any variables or their values. The output of the print statement is the value of `result[2][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and the value of `result[2][1]` is printed.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 2 elements, `j` is 1, and the value of `result[2][1]` is printed.**
