Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, where all elements in `a` are even. `result` is a list containing operations that were performed to adjust the elements of `a` to ensure all elements are even. Each operation in `result` is a list of four integers representing the indices of the elements that were adjusted. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `H` is 0 or `W` is 0), `result` remains an empty list.**
