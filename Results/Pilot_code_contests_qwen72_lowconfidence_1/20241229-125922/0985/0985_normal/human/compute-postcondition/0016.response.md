The code appends a list `[i + 1, j + 1, i + 1, j + 2]` to the `result` list. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `H` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `W` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` remains a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers.
- `a[i][j] % 2 != 0` remains true.
- `j + 1` is less than `W`.

The only change is in the `result` list, which now contains the list `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`, `a[i][j] % 2 != 0`, and `j + 1` is less than `W`.**
