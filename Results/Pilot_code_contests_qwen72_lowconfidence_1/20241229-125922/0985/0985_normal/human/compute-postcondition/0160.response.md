The code prints the value located at the index `[1][1]` of the `result` list. Since the code only involves printing and does not modify any variables, the values of `i`, `result`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` has at least 2 elements, `result[1]` has at least two elements, `j` is 1**
