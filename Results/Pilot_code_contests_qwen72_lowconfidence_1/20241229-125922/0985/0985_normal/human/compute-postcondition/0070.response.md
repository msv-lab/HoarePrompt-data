The value of `a[i][j]` is decremented by 1. Given that `i` and `j` are both 1, the element `a[1][1]` is decreased by 1. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[1][1]` is decreased by 1, `result` now contains the original operations plus `[2, 2, 2, 3]`, and `j` is 1.**
