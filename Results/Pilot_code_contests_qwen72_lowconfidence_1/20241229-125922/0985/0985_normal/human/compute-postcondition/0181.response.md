The function `func_1` does not explicitly show any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided (H and W are integers such that 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500; a_{ij} is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W), it can be inferred that the function likely processes a 2D array (or matrix) of dimensions H x W, where each element a_{ij} is an integer between 0 and 9.

Since the output description is not provided, I cannot specify the exact return value. However, given the context, the function might return some form of processed data or a result based on the input matrix.

Functionality: **The function processes a 2D array (matrix) of dimensions H x W, where H and W are integers such that 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 500, and each element a_{ij} is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 9. The function returns a result based on the input matrix.**
