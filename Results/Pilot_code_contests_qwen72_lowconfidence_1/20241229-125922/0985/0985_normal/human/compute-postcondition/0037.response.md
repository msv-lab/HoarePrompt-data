Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, and `j` is 1. If `a[0][1]` is even, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `j + 1 < W`, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[0][2]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`. If `j + 1 == W` and `i + 1 < H`, `a[0][1]` is decremented by 1, `a[1][1]` is incremented by 1, and `result` is a list containing the value `[1, 2, 2, 2]` or the updated values based on the conditions. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `a` or `result`.***
