Postcondition: ***`H` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `W` is an integer such that 1 < W â‰¤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers. If `j + 1 < W`, then `a[1][2]` is incremented by 1, making it an odd number since it was previously even, all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) except `a[1][1]` and `a[1][2]` are even, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] - 1`, and `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even and now includes `[3, 2, 3, 3]`. If `j + 1 == W`, then all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even, `a[1][1]` is `a[1][1] - 1`, and `result` contains a series of operations performed to ensure all elements in the second row (`a[1]`) are even. In both cases, `j` is 1, and `W` must be greater than 1.***
