The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. The state of the program remains the same except for the flow control aspect.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is an empty list or contains the updated values based on the conditions, `j` is 1, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
