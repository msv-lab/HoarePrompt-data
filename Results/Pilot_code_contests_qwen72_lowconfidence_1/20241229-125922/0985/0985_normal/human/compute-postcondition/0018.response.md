The code `a[i][j + 1] = a[i][j + 1] + 1` increments the value at `a[i][j + 1]` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `a[i][j + 1]` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`H` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is `[1, j + 1, 1, j + 2]`, `a[i][j]` is an even number, `j + 1` is less than `W`, and `a[i][j + 1]` is `a[i][j + 1] + 1`.**
