The code snippet `a[i][j + 1] = a[i][j + 1] + 1` increments the value of the element in the list `a` located at the position `[i][j + 1]` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so the element being modified is `a[0][2]`. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `a[0][1]` is `a[0][1] - 1`, `a[0][2]` is `a[0][2] + 1`, `result` is `[1, 2, 1, 3]`, `j` is 1**
