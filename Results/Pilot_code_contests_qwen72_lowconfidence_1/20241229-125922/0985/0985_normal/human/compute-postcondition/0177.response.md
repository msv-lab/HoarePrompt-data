The value at `result[i][j]` is printed, where `i` is 2 and `j` is 2. This means the value at `result[2][2]` has been printed. The value at `result[2][1]` had already been printed previously, so now both `result[2][1]` and `result[2][2]` have been printed.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `result` has at least 3 elements, `result[2]` has at least 3 elements, `j` is 2, and the values at `result[2][1]` and `result[2][2]` have been printed.**
