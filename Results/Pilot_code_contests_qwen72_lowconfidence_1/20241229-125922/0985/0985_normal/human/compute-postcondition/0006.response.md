The code snippet appends a new list to `a` where the elements of this new list are the result of converting a space-separated string (input by the user) into integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This modifies the list `a`.

- `H` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500.
- `W` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500.
- `a` was initially a list containing a single list of integers and now contains two lists of integers (the original list and the new list from the input).
- `result` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`H` is an integer such that 1 ≤ H ≤ 500, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing two lists of integers, `result` is an empty list, `i` is 1**.
