To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(W):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute at least once, `W` must be greater than 0. Let's break down the state and see if any adjustments are necessary:

1. **`H` must be greater than 0**: This condition is already given and does not affect the loop directly.
2. **`i` is 0**: This variable is not used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.
3. **`W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500**: For the loop to execute, `W` must be at least 1. Since the condition 1 ≤ W ≤ 500 already ensures that `W` is at least 1, no adjustment is needed.
4. **`a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers**: This condition is already given and does not need to be adjusted.
5. **`result` is an empty list**: This variable is not used in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the only condition that needs to be explicitly stated for the loop to execute is that `W` must be greater than 0. However, since the condition 1 ≤ W ≤ 500 already ensures this, no further adjustment is needed.

Therefore, the state remains as follows:

State: **`H` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `W` is an integer such that 1 ≤ W ≤ 500, `a` is a list containing `H` lists of integers, each list having `W` integers, `result` is an empty list**
