You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There is a country with n citizens. The i-th of them initially has a_{i} money. The government strictly controls the wealth of its citizens. Whenever a citizen makes a purchase or earns some money, they must send a receipt to the social services mentioning the amount of money they currently have.

Sometimes the government makes payouts to the poor: all citizens who have strictly less money than x are paid accordingly so that after the payout they have exactly x money. In this case the citizens don't send a receipt.

You know the initial wealth of every citizen and the log of all events: receipts and payouts. Restore the amount of money each citizen has after all events.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the numer of citizens.

The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^{9}) — the initial balances of citizens.

The next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the number of events.

Each of the next q lines contains a single event. The events are given in chronological order.

Each event is described as either 1 p x (1 ≤ p ≤ n, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}), or 2 x (0 ≤ x ≤ 10^{9}). In the first case we have a receipt that the balance of the p-th person becomes equal to x. In the second case we have a payoff with parameter x.

Output

Print n integers — the balances of all citizens after all events.

Examples

1 2 3 4
3
2 3

Note

In the first example the balances change as follows: 1 2 3 4 → 3 3 3 4 → 3 2 3 4 → 3 2 3 4

In the second example the balances change as follows: 3 50 2 1 10 → 3 0 2 1 10 → 8 8 8 8 10 → 8 8 20 8 10
