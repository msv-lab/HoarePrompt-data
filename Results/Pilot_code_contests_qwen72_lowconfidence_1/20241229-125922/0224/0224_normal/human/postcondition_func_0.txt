The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value and attempts to convert that input into an integer, which it then returns. If the user input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned an integer value or raised an exception, depending on the user's input.
