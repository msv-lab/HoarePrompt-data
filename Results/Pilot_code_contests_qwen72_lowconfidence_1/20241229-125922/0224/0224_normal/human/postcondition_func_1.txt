The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list.
