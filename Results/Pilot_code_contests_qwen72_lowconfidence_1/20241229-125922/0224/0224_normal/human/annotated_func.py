def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value and attempts to convert that input into an integer, which it then returns. If the user input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned an integer value or raised an exception, depending on the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    #The program returns a list of integers, each of which was originally provided as a space-separated value from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list.

    x, y, u, v = 0, 1, 1, 0
    while a != 0:
        q, r = b // a, b % a
        
        m, n = x - u * q, y - v * q

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `x` and `y` are such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`
    gcd = b
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, along with `x` and `y` such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b > 0`. It computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function returns a tuple `(gcd, x, y)`, where `gcd` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = gcd`. The function correctly handles the case where `a` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is `b` and the coefficients `x` and `y` satisfy the equation. If `a` is greater than zero, the function iterates through the algorithm until `a` becomes zero, maintaining the invariant that `b` is the GCD and `x` and `y` are the corresponding coefficients.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters. The function assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide the necessary inputs and computations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`. It assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide necessary inputs and computations. The function performs the following actions:

1. Calls `func_1` to get a value `N`.
2. Calls `func_2` to get a list `A`.
3. If `N` is 1, it prints a series of specific values and returns `None`.
4. If `N` is not 1, it calls `func_3` with arguments `N - 1` and `N` to get `gcd`, `x`, and `y`.
5. Constructs a new list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`.
6. Appends `0` to the list `B`.
7. Prints a series of formatted outputs including elements of `B` and modified elements of `A`.
8. Modifies the last element of `A` to be `N` and prints the negated elements of `A`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `N` is 1, the function prints specific values and exits early.
- If `N` is less than 1, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `N` to be a positive integer.
- If `func_1`, `func_2`, or `func_3` do not return expected values, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.

Final State:
- The function returns `None`.
- The list `A` is modified such that its last element is set to `N`.
- Various intermediate lists and variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `gcd`, `x`, `y`) are used and manipulated within the function scope.
