You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of n integers.

You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:

  * Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 



It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000): the number of elements of the array.

The second line contains n elements of an array a separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

The output should contain six lines representing three operations.

For each operation, print two lines:

  * The first line contains two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n): the bounds of the selected segment.

  * The second line contains r-l+1 integers b_l, b_{l+1}, ..., b_r (-10^{18} ≤ b_i ≤ 10^{18}): the numbers to add to a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r, respectively; b_i should be divisible by r - l + 1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for making all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operations exactly three times. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input size `N` and the array `A` using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `N` is 1, the program directly prints the required operations to set the single element to zero, which is correct.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `N-1` and `N`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is used to determine the multipliers for the first operation.

4. **First Operation**: For the first operation, the program sets the first `N-1` elements of the array to zero by adding a multiple of `N-1` to each of these elements. The multiplier is calculated using the GCD and the coefficients from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The last element remains unchanged.

5. **Second Operation**: The second operation targets the last element of the array, setting it to `N` by adding the appropriate value. This ensures that the last element is adjusted to a value that can be easily handled in the final step.

6. **Third Operation**: The third operation sets all elements to zero by adding the negative of the current values to each element. This step ensures that all elements are zero after the three operations.

The program handles all edge cases and general cases correctly, ensuring that the array is set to zero in exactly three operations as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys
from atexit import register

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from io import BytesIO as stream
else:
    from io import StringIO as stream
sys.stdin = stream(sys.stdin.read())
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
sys.stdout = stream()
register(lambda : sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value and attempts to convert that input into an integer, which it then returns. If the user input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned an integer value or raised an exception, depending on the user's input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    #The program returns a list of integers, each of which was originally provided as a space-separated value from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b > 0 and a >= 0.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y, u, v = 0, 1, 1, 0
    while a != 0:
        q, r = b // a, b % a
        
        m, n = x - u * q, y - v * q
        
        b, a, x, y, u, v = a, r, u, v, m, n
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `x` and `y` are such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`
    gcd = b
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, along with `x` and `y` such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b > 0`. It computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function returns a tuple `(gcd, x, y)`, where `gcd` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = gcd`. The function correctly handles the case where `a` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is `b` and the coefficients `x` and `y` satisfy the equation. If `a` is greater than zero, the function iterates through the algorithm until `a` becomes zero, maintaining the invariant that `b` is the GCD and `x` and `y` are the corresponding coefficients.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters. The function assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide the necessary inputs and computations.
def func_4():
    N = func_1()
    A = func_2()
    if (N == 1) :
        print(1, 1)
        print(-A[0])
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, and `N` is not equal to 1
    gcd, x, y = func_3(N - 1, N)
    B = []
    for a in A[:N - 1]:
        B.append(-a * (N - 1) * x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N - 1` elements, each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` where `a` is the corresponding element from `A[:N - 1]`
    B.append(0)
    print(1, N - 1)
    print(*B[:N - 1])
    A = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(A, B)]
    print(N, N)
    print(N - A[-1])
    A[-1] = N
    print(1, N)
    print(*[(-a) for a in A])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`. It assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide necessary inputs and computations. The function performs the following actions:

1. Calls `func_1` to get a value `N`.
2. Calls `func_2` to get a list `A`.
3. If `N` is 1, it prints a series of specific values and returns `None`.
4. If `N` is not 1, it calls `func_3` with arguments `N - 1` and `N` to get `gcd`, `x`, and `y`.
5. Constructs a new list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`.
6. Appends `0` to the list `B`.
7. Prints a series of formatted outputs including elements of `B` and modified elements of `A`.
8. Modifies the last element of `A` to be `N` and prints the negated elements of `A`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `N` is 1, the function prints specific values and exits early.
- If `N` is less than 1, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `N` to be a positive integer.
- If `func_1`, `func_2`, or `func_3` do not return expected values, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.

Final State:
- The function returns `None`.
- The list `A` is modified such that its last element is set to `N`.
- Various intermediate lists and variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `gcd`, `x`, `y`) are used and manipulated within the function scope.
