Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program provided appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Handling of Special Case (N = 1)**:
   - When `N` is 1, the function prints the required output to make the single element zero in three operations. This is done correctly by subtracting the single element in the first operation, and then adding 0 in the next two operations.

2. **General Case (N > 1)**:
   - The function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (implemented in `func_3`) to find the GCD and the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `(N-1)*x + N*y = gcd`.
   - It constructs a list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`. This ensures that the sum of the elements in the segment is a multiple of `N - 1`.
   - The function then prints the first operation, applying the values in `B` to the segment `[1, N-1]`.
   - It updates the array `A` by adding the corresponding values from `B`.
   - The second operation modifies the last element of `A` to make it `N` and prints the necessary value.
   - The third operation prints the negated values of the updated array `A` to make all elements zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the special case when `N` is 1.
   - For `N > 1`, the function ensures that the operations are performed in a way that makes all elements of the array zero in exactly three operations, as required by the problem description.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The function assumes valid input, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description.
   - The input is expected to be a positive integer `N` and a list of integers `A`, and the function does not handle invalid inputs explicitly, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct for all valid inputs and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
