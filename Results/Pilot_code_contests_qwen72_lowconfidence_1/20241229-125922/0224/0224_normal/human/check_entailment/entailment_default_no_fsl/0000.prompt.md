You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of n integers.

You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:

  * Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 



It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000): the number of elements of the array.

The second line contains n elements of an array a separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

The output should contain six lines representing three operations.

For each operation, print two lines:

  * The first line contains two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n): the bounds of the selected segment.

  * The second line contains r-l+1 integers b_l, b_{l+1}, ..., b_r (-10^{18} ≤ b_i ≤ 10^{18}): the numbers to add to a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r, respectively; b_i should be divisible by r - l + 1.

    func_4()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value and attempts to convert that input into an integer, which it then returns. If the user input cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric string), a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned an integer value or raised an exception, depending on the user's input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the standard input, expecting a space-separated list of integers. It then converts these strings into integers and returns them as a list. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, the function will return an empty list.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(a, b):
    (x, y, u, v) = (0, 1, 1, 0)
    while a != 0:
        (q, r) = (b // a, b % a)
        (m, n) = (x - u * q, y - v * q)
        (b, a, x, y, u, v) = (a, r, u, v, m, n)
    gcd = b
    return (gcd, x, y)
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b > 0`. It computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function returns a tuple `(gcd, x, y)`, where `gcd` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = gcd`. The function correctly handles the case where `a` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is `b` and the coefficients `x` and `y` satisfy the equation. If `a` is greater than zero, the function iterates through the algorithm until `a` becomes zero, maintaining the invariant that `b` is the GCD and `x` and `y` are the corresponding coefficients.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    N = func_1()
    A = func_2()
    if N == 1:
        print(1, 1)
        print(-A[0])
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        return
    (gcd, x, y) = func_3(N - 1, N)
    B = []
    for a in A[:N - 1]:
        B.append(-a * (N - 1) * x)
    B.append(0)
    print(1, N - 1)
    print(*B[:N - 1])
    A = [a + b for (a, b) in zip(A, B)]
    print(N, N)
    print(N - A[-1])
    A[-1] = N
    print(1, N)
    print(*[-a for a in A])
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`. It assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide necessary inputs and computations. The function performs the following actions:

1. Calls `func_1` to get a value `N`.
2. Calls `func_2` to get a list `A`.
3. If `N` is 1, it prints a series of specific values and returns `None`.
4. If `N` is not 1, it calls `func_3` with arguments `N - 1` and `N` to get `gcd`, `x`, and `y`.
5. Constructs a new list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`.
6. Appends `0` to the list `B`.
7. Prints a series of formatted outputs including elements of `B` and modified elements of `A`.
8. Modifies the last element of `A` to be `N` and prints the negated elements of `A`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `N` is 1, the function prints specific values and exits early.
- If `N` is less than 1, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `N` to be a positive integer.
- If `func_1`, `func_2`, or `func_3` do not return expected values, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.

Final State:
- The function returns `None`.
- The list `A` is modified such that its last element is set to `N`.
- Various intermediate lists and variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `gcd`, `x`, `y`) are used and manipulated within the function scope.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
