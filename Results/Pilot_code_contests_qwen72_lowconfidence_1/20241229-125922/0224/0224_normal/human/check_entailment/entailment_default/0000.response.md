Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `N` is less than 1, which is outside the valid range specified in the problem description (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000). Although the problem guarantees that `N` will be a positive integer, the function does not explicitly check for this condition and may behave unpredictably if `N` is less than 1. Additionally, the function assumes that the input will always be valid, but it does not handle edge cases where the input might be invalid, such as an empty list or a list with non-integer values. However, since the problem specifies that the input will be valid, the primary issue is the lack of a check for `N` being less than 1, which could lead to undefined behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
