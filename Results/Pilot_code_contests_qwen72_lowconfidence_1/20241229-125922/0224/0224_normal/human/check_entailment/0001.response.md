Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It follows the steps required to make all elements of the array equal to zero using exactly three operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of elements `N` and the array `A` from the input.

2. **Special Case for Single Element**:
   - If `N == 1`, it directly prints the required operations to set the single element to zero. This handles the edge case where the array has only one element.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`func_3`) to find the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `(N-1)*x + N*y = gcd(N-1, N)`. Since `gcd(N-1, N) = 1`, this ensures that `x` and `y` are integers.
   - It constructs the first operation by setting the first `N-1` elements to `-a * (N-1) * x`, which makes the sum of these elements divisible by `N-1`.
   - The second operation sets the last element to `N - A[-1]`, ensuring it becomes zero.
   - The third operation adjusts the entire array to zero by adding the negative of each element.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program ensures that each operation is valid and within the constraints.
   - It correctly handles the edge cases and general cases, making sure that all elements are set to zero in exactly three operations.

Given the detailed logic and the constraints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, thus it is correct.
