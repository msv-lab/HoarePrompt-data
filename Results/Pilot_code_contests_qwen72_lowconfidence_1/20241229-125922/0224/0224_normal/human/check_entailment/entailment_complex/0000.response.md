Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code provided follows the problem description for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads the integer `N` from the input.
   - `func_2()` reads the list of integers `A` from the input.
   - These functions ensure that the input is read correctly and converted to the appropriate types.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `N` is 1, the function prints the required output directly:
     ```python
     if (N == 1) :
         print(1, 1)
         print(-A[0])
         print(1, 1)
         print(0)
         print(1, 1)
         print(0)
         return
     ```
     This handles the case where the array has only one element, and it correctly makes the single element zero in three operations.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `N > 1`, the function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`func_3`) to compute the GCD and the coefficients `x` and `y`:
     ```python
     gcd, x, y = func_3(N - 1, N)
     ```
   - It constructs the list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for the first `N-1` elements of `A`:
     ```python
     B = []
     for a in A[:N - 1]:
         B.append(-a * (N - 1) * x)
     B.append(0)
     ```
   - It prints the first operation, which modifies the first `N-1` elements:
     ```python
     print(1, N - 1)
     print(*B[:N - 1])
     ```
   - It updates the array `A` by adding the corresponding elements of `B`:
     ```python
     A = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(A, B)]
     ```
   - It prints the second operation, which modifies the last element:
     ```python
     print(N, N)
     print(N - A[-1])
     A[-1] = N
     ```
   - It prints the third operation, which sets all elements to zero:
     ```python
     print(1, N)
     print(*[(-a) for a in A])
     ```

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `N` is 1 correctly.
   - The function assumes `N` is a positive integer, which aligns with the problem constraints.
   - The function uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to ensure that the operations are valid and the final array is set to zero.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the required segments and values for each operation.

Given that the code handles all specified cases and constraints correctly, and there are no identified edge cases where the program fails, the code is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
