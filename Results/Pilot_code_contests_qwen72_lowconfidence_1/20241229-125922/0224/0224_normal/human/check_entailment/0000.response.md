Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for making all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operations exactly three times. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input size `N` and the array `A` using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `N` is 1, the program directly prints the required operations to set the single element to zero, which is correct.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `N-1` and `N`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is used to determine the multipliers for the first operation.

4. **First Operation**: For the first operation, the program sets the first `N-1` elements of the array to zero by adding a multiple of `N-1` to each of these elements. The multiplier is calculated using the GCD and the coefficients from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The last element remains unchanged.

5. **Second Operation**: The second operation targets the last element of the array, setting it to `N` by adding the appropriate value. This ensures that the last element is adjusted to a value that can be easily handled in the final step.

6. **Third Operation**: The third operation sets all elements to zero by adding the negative of the current values to each element. This step ensures that all elements are zero after the three operations.

The program handles all edge cases and general cases correctly, ensuring that the array is set to zero in exactly three operations as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
