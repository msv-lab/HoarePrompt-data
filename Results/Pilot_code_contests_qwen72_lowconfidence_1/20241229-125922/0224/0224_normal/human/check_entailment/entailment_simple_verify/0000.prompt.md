You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of n integers.

You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:

  * Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 



It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000): the number of elements of the array.

The second line contains n elements of an array a separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

The output should contain six lines representing three operations.

For each operation, print two lines:

  * The first line contains two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n): the bounds of the selected segment.

  * The second line contains r-l+1 integers b_l, b_{l+1}, ..., b_r (-10^{18} ≤ b_i ≤ 10^{18}): the numbers to add to a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r, respectively; b_i should be divisible by r - l + 1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for making all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operations exactly three times. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input size `N` and the array `A` using the functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `N` is 1, the program directly prints the required operations to set the single element to zero, which is correct.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `N-1` and `N`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is used to determine the multipliers for the first operation.

4. **First Operation**: For the first operation, the program sets the first `N-1` elements of the array to zero by adding a multiple of `N-1` to each of these elements. The multiplier is calculated using the GCD and the coefficients from the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The last element remains unchanged.

5. **Second Operation**: The second operation targets the last element of the array, setting it to `N` by adding the appropriate value. This ensures that the last element is adjusted to a value that can be easily handled in the final step.

6. **Third Operation**: The third operation sets all elements to zero by adding the negative of the current values to each element. This step ensures that all elements are zero after the three operations.

The program handles all edge cases and general cases correctly, ensuring that the array is set to zero in exactly three operations as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
