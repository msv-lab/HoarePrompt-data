You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given an array a of n integers.

You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:

  * Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 



It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000): the number of elements of the array.

The second line contains n elements of an array a separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

The output should contain six lines representing three operations.

For each operation, print two lines:

  * The first line contains two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n): the bounds of the selected segment.

  * The second line contains r-l+1 integers b_l, b_{l+1}, ..., b_r (-10^{18} ≤ b_i ≤ 10^{18}): the numbers to add to a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r, respectively; b_i should be divisible by r - l + 1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It follows the steps required to make all elements of the array equal to zero using exactly three operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of elements `N` and the array `A` from the input.

2. **Special Case for Single Element**:
   - If `N == 1`, it directly prints the required operations to set the single element to zero. This handles the edge case where the array has only one element.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`func_3`) to find the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `(N-1)*x + N*y = gcd(N-1, N)`. Since `gcd(N-1, N) = 1`, this ensures that `x` and `y` are integers.
   - It constructs the first operation by setting the first `N-1` elements to `-a * (N-1) * x`, which makes the sum of these elements divisible by `N-1`.
   - The second operation sets the last element to `N - A[-1]`, ensuring it becomes zero.
   - The third operation adjusts the entire array to zero by adding the negative of each element.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program ensures that each operation is valid and within the constraints.
   - It correctly handles the edge cases and general cases, making sure that all elements are set to zero in exactly three operations.

Given the detailed logic and the constraints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, thus it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`. It assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide necessary inputs and computations. The function performs the following actions:

1. Calls `func_1` to get a value `N`.
2. Calls `func_2` to get a list `A`.
3. If `N` is 1, it prints a series of specific values and returns `None`.
4. If `N` is not 1, it calls `func_3` with arguments `N - 1` and `N` to get `gcd`, `x`, and `y`.
5. Constructs a new list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`.
6. Appends `0` to the list `B`.
7. Prints a series of formatted outputs including elements of `B` and modified elements of `A`.
8. Modifies the last element of `A` to be `N` and prints the negated elements of `A`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `N` is 1, the function prints specific values and exits early.
- If `N` is less than 1, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `N` to be a positive integer.
- If `func_1`, `func_2`, or `func_3` do not return expected values, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.

Final State:
- The function returns `None`.
- The list `A` is modified such that its last element is set to `N`.
- Various intermediate lists and variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `gcd`, `x`, `y`) are used and manipulated within the function scope.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
