Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of elements `N` using `func_1()`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `A` using `func_2()`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `N` is 1, the program handles this special case by directly printing the required output:
     ```
     1 1
     -A[0]
     1 1
     0
     1 1
     0
     ```
   - This ensures that the single element is set to zero in three operations.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `N > 1`, the program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`func_3`) to find the GCD and coefficients `x` and `y` such that `(N - 1) * x + N * y = 1`.
   - It constructs the list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for the corresponding element `a` in `A[:N-1]`. This ensures that the sum of the elements in `B` is a multiple of `N - 1`.

4. **First Operation**:
   - The program prints the segment `[1, N-1]` and the list `B[:N-1]`.
   - This operation adds multiples of `N - 1` to the first `N - 1` elements of `A`.

5. **Second Operation**:
   - The program updates the list `A` by adding the corresponding elements of `B` to `A`.
   - It then prints the segment `[N, N]` and the value `N - A[-1]` to set the last element of `A` to `N`.

6. **Third Operation**:
   - The program updates the last element of `A` to `N`.
   - It then prints the segment `[1, N]` and the list `[-a for a in A]` to set all elements of `A` to zero.

### Why the Program Always Does What the Problem Description Says:

- **Three Operations**: The program performs exactly three operations as required.
- **Segment Selection**: Each operation selects a valid segment within the array.
- **Multiples of Segment Length**: In each operation, the added values are multiples of the length of the selected segment.
- **Final State**: After the three operations, all elements of the array `A` are set to zero, as required by the problem description.

Thus, the program correctly solves the problem and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
