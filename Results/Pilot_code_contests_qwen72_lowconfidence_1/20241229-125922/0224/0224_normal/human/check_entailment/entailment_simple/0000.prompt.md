You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given an array a of n integers.

You want to make all elements of a equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:

  * Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of len to it, where len is the length of this segment (added integers can be different). 



It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of a equal to zero.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000): the number of elements of the array.

The second line contains n elements of an array a separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

The output should contain six lines representing three operations.

For each operation, print two lines:

  * The first line contains two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n): the bounds of the selected segment.

  * The second line contains r-l+1 integers b_l, b_{l+1}, ..., b_r (-10^{18} ≤ b_i ≤ 10^{18}): the numbers to add to a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_r, respectively; b_i should be divisible by r - l + 1.

Example

Input


4
1 3 2 4


Output


1 1 
-1
3 4
4 2
2 4
-3 -6 -6
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys
from atexit import register

if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    from io import BytesIO as stream
else:
    from io import StringIO as stream
sys.stdin = stream(sys.stdin.read())
input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
sys.stdout = stream()
register(lambda : sys.__stdout__.write(sys.stdout.getvalue()))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    #The program returns a list of integers, each of which was originally provided as a space-separated value from the standard input.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b > 0 and a >= 0.
def func_3(a, b):
    x, y, u, v = 0, 1, 1, 0
    while a != 0:
        q, r = b // a, b % a
        
        m, n = x - u * q, y - v * q
        
        b, a, x, y, u, v = a, r, u, v, m, n
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is 0, `b` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `x` and `y` are such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`
    gcd = b
    return gcd, x, y
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, along with `x` and `y` such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = GCD(original_a, original_b)`

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters. The function assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide the necessary inputs and computations.
def func_4():
    N = func_1()
    A = func_2()
    if (N == 1) :
        print(1, 1)
        print(-A[0])
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        print(1, 1)
        print(0)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, and `N` is not equal to 1
    gcd, x, y = func_3(N - 1, N)
    B = []
    for a in A[:N - 1]:
        B.append(-a * (N - 1) * x)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N - 1` elements, each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` where `a` is the corresponding element from `A[:N - 1]`
    B.append(0)
    print(1, N - 1)
    print(*B[:N - 1])
    A = [(a + b) for a, b in zip(A, B)]
    print(N, N)
    print(N - A[-1])
    A[-1] = N
    print(1, N)
    print(*[(-a) for a in A])


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
