Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns `None`. It assumes the existence of other functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` which provide necessary inputs and computations. The function performs the following actions:

1. Calls `func_1` to get a value `N`.
2. Calls `func_2` to get a list `A`.
3. If `N` is 1, it prints a series of specific values and returns `None`.
4. If `N` is not 1, it calls `func_3` with arguments `N - 1` and `N` to get `gcd`, `x`, and `y`.
5. Constructs a new list `B` where each element is `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each `a` in `A[:N - 1]`.
6. Appends `0` to the list `B`.
7. Prints a series of formatted outputs including elements of `B` and modified elements of `A`.
8. Modifies the last element of `A` to be `N` and prints the negated elements of `A`.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `N` is 1, the function prints specific values and exits early.
- If `N` is less than 1, the behavior is undefined because the function expects `N` to be a positive integer.
- If `func_1`, `func_2`, or `func_3` do not return expected values, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.

Final State:
- The function returns `None`.
- The list `A` is modified such that its last element is set to `N`.
- Various intermediate lists and variables (`N`, `A`, `B`, `gcd`, `x`, `y`) are used and manipulated within the function scope. **
