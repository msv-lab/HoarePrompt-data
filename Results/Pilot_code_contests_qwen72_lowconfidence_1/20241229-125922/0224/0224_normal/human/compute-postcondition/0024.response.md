The code snippet `print(N, N)` prints the value of `N` twice. This does not alter the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the action of printing `N`.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is a list where the first `N - 1` elements are `a * (1 - (N - 1) * x)` for each corresponding element `a` from the original `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is the same as the last element of the original `A`; `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`. The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed, and `N` has been printed twice.**
