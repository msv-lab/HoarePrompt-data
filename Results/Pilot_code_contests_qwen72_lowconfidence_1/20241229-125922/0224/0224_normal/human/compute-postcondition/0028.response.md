The provided code snippet is:

```
print(*[(-a) for a in A])
```

This line of code prints each element of the list `A` negated, i.e., it prints the negative of each element in `A`.

Given the Initial State:
- `N` is the result of `func_1()`.
- `A` is a list where the first `N - 1` elements are `a * (1 - (N - 1) * x)` for each corresponding element `a` from the original `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `N`.
- `func_2` has been called.
- `func_3` has been called.
- `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`.
- `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`.
- The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed.
- `N` has been printed twice.
- `1` and `N` have been printed.

After executing the code snippet, the following changes occur:
- The negative of each element in `A` is printed.

The values of the variables and the state of the program remain unchanged except for the output produced by the `print` statement.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is a list where the first `N - 1` elements are `a * (1 - (N - 1) * x)` for each corresponding element `a` from the original `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `N`; `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`. The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed, `N` has been printed twice, and `1` and `N` have been printed. The negative of each element in `A` has been printed.**
