The code `print(1, N)` will print the values `1` and `N`. This does not change any of the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the values `1` and `N` are printed.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is a list where the first `N - 1` elements are `a * (1 - (N - 1) * x)` for each corresponding element `a` from the original `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `N`; `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`. The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed, `N` has been printed twice, and `1` and `N` have been printed.**
