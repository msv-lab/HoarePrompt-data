The code `print(-A[0])` prints the negation of the first element in the list `A`. Since `A` is the result of `func_2()`, and `func_2()` has already been called, `A` contains the result from this function call. The value of `N` remains unchanged.

To summarize the changes:
- The first element of `A` is accessed and its negation is printed.
- The value of `N` remains 1.
- The state of `func_3` remains unchanged (it exists but has not been called).

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, `-A[0]` has been printed**
