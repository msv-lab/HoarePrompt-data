The code snippet `print(0)` executes the printing of the integer `0`. This action does not alter any variables or the state of the program beyond this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains largely unchanged from the initial state, with the addition of the fact that another `0` has been printed.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, `-A[0]` has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed, 0 has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed again, 0 has been printed again.**
