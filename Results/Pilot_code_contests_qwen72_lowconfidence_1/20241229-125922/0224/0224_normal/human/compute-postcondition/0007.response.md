The provided Python code snippet `print(1, 1)` will print the numbers 1 and 1 separated by a space. This action does not alter any of the variables in the current state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the additional output generated by this print statement.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, `-A[0]` has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed, 0 has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed again**
