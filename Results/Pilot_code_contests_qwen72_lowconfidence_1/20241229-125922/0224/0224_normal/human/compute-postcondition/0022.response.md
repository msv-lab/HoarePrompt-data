The code prints the first `N - 1` elements of the list `B`. The elements in `B[:N - 1]` are calculated as `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`.

- `N` remains the result of `func_1()`.
- `A` remains the result of `func_2()`.
- `func_2` has been called.
- `func_3` has been called.
- `gcd`, `x`, and `y` remain the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`.
- `B` remains a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`.

The only change is that the first `N - 1` elements of `B` are printed.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`. The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed.**
