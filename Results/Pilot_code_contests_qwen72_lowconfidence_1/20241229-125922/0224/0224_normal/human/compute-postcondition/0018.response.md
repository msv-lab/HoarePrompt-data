The code snippet `B.append(-a * (N - 1) * x)` appends a new element to the list `B`. This new element is calculated as `-a * (N - 1) * x`, where `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is at least 2
- `A` has at least `N - 1` elements
- `func_2` has been called
- `func_3` has been called
- `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`
- `B` is a list containing three elements `-a * (N - 1) * x` where the first `a` is the first element in `A[:N - 1]`, the second `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`, and the third `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`
- `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `B` now contains four elements: the original three elements plus the new element `-a * (N - 1) * x`.
- The value of `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]` after the first three elements.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is at least 2, `A` has at least `N - 1` elements, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing four elements `-a * (N - 1) * x` where the first `a` is the first element in `A[:N - 1]`, the second `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`, the third `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`, and the fourth `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`, `a` is the next element in `A[:N - 1]`**
