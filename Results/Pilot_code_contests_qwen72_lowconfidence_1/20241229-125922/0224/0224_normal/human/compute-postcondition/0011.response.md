The variables `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_3` when called with the arguments `N - 1` and `N`. Since `N` is the result of `func_1()` and is not equal to 1, the exact values of `gcd`, `x`, and `y` depend on the implementation of `func_3`. However, the values of `N` and `A` remain unchanged, and `func_2` has already been called. The state of `func_3` changes from not being called to being called.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `N` is not equal to 1, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`**.
