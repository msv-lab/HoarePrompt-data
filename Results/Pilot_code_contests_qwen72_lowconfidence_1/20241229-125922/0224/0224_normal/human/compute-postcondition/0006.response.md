The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(0)
```

This code only prints the number 0 to the console and does not modify any variables or call any functions. Therefore, the state of the variables and functions remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, `-A[0]` has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed, 0 has been printed**
