The code `print(N - A[-1])` impacts the program by printing the result of the subtraction `N - A[-1]`. According to the initial state, `N` is the result of `func_1()`, and `A` is a list where the last element is the same as the last element of the original `A`.

Given that the last element of `A` (`A[-1]`) is the same as the last element of the original `A`, the value of `N - A[-1]` depends on the specific values of `N` and the last element of `A`. However, since the exact values of `N` and `A[-1]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of the subtraction.

However, the operation itself does not alter the state of any variables, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing the result of `N - A[-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is a list where the first `N - 1` elements are `a * (1 - (N - 1) * x)` for each corresponding element `a` from the original `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is the same as the last element of the original `A`; `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`. The first `N - 1` elements of `B` have been printed, and `N` has been printed twice.**
