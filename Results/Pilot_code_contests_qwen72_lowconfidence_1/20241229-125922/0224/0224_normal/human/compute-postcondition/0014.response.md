The code snippet appends the value `-a * (N - 1) * x` to the list `B`. Here's the impact of this operation:

- `B` is no longer an empty list; it now contains one element which is `-a * (N - 1) * x`.
- The values of `N`, `A`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `A` has at least `N - 1` elements, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing one element `-a * (N - 1) * x`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `A` has at least `N - 1` elements, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing one element `-a * (N - 1) * x`**
