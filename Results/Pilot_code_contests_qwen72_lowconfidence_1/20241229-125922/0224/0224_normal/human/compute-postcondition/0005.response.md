The code snippet `print(1, 1)` prints the values 1 and 1. This operation does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing to the console.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, `-A[0]` has been printed, (1, 1) has been printed**
