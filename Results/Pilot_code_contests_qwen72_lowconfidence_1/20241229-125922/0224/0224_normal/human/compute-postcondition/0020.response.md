The code snippet `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the end of the list `B`. The list `B` initially contains `N - 1` elements, each calculated as `-a * (N - 1) * x` where `a` is the corresponding element from `A[:N - 1]`. After appending `0`, the list `B` will now contain `N` elements.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`.
Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`.**
