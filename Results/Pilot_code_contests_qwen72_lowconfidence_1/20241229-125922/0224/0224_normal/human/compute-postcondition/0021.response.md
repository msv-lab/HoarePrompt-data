The code prints the tuple `(1, N - 1)`. This operation does not modify any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing.

Output State: **`N` is the result of `func_1()`, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` has been called, `gcd`, `x`, and `y` are the results of `func_3(N - 1, N)`, `B` is a list containing `N` elements, where the first `N - 1` elements are `-a * (N - 1) * x` for each corresponding element `a` from `A[:N - 1]`, and the last element is `0`.**
