The code snippet `print(1, 1)` prints the numbers 1 and 1 to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `N` or `A`, nor does it call `func_3`. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing to the console.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `A` is the result of `func_2()`, `func_2` has been called, `func_3` exists but has not been called, and the current value of `N` is 1**
