The function `func_3(a, b)` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b > 0`. It computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The function returns a tuple `(gcd, x, y)`, where `gcd` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `original_a * x + original_b * y = gcd`. The function correctly handles the case where `a` is zero, ensuring that the GCD is `b` and the coefficients `x` and `y` satisfy the equation. If `a` is greater than zero, the function iterates through the algorithm until `a` becomes zero, maintaining the invariant that `b` is the GCD and `x` and `y` are the corresponding coefficients.
