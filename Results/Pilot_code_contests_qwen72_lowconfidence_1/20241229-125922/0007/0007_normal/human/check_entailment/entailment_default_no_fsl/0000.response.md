Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for selecting books to ensure both Alice and Bob like at least `k` books while minimizing the total reading time has some issues. Here are the main points of concern:

1. **Handling Books Liked by Both Alice and Bob**:
   - The code attempts to replace books liked by only one person with books liked by both to minimize the total reading time. However, the logic for this replacement is flawed. The code checks if `alice == k` and `bob == k` and then tries to replace books, but this logic can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `alice` and `bob` are already at `k`, the code might still try to replace books, which can result in fewer than `k` books being selected for one of them.

2. **Ensuring Exactly `k` Books for Each**:
   - The code does not guarantee that exactly `k` books are selected for both Alice and Bob. It may prematurely stop selecting books if it finds a combination that seems optimal but does not meet the requirement of having exactly `k` books for each.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where it is impossible to select `k` books for both Alice and Bob. For example, if there are not enough books that both Alice and Bob like, the code might still try to replace books, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
5 2
6 0 0
9 0 0
1 0 1
2 1 1
5 1 0

Expected Output:
8

Actual Output:
-1
```
In this case, the code incorrectly outputs `-1` instead of `8`, because it fails to correctly handle the selection of books that both Alice and Bob like.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
