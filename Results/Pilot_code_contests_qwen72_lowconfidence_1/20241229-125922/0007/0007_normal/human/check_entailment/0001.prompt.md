You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Easy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully.

Summer vacation has started so Alice and Bob want to play and joy, but... Their mom doesn't think so. She says that they have to read some amount of books before all entertainments. Alice and Bob will read each book together to end this exercise faster.

There are n books in the family library. The i-th book is described by three integers: t_i — the amount of time Alice and Bob need to spend to read it, a_i (equals 1 if Alice likes the i-th book and 0 if not), and b_i (equals 1 if Bob likes the i-th book and 0 if not).

So they need to choose some books from the given n books in such a way that:

  * Alice likes at least k books from the chosen set and Bob likes at least k books from the chosen set; 
  * the total reading time of these books is minimized (they are children and want to play and joy as soon a possible). 



The set they choose is the same for both Alice an Bob (it's shared between them) and they read all books together, so the total reading time is the sum of t_i over all books that are in the chosen set.

Your task is to help them and find any suitable set of books or determine that it is impossible to find such a set.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

The next n lines contain descriptions of books, one description per line: the i-th line contains three integers t_i, a_i and b_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4, 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1), where:

  * t_i — the amount of time required for reading the i-th book; 
  * a_i equals 1 if Alice likes the i-th book and 0 otherwise; 
  * b_i equals 1 if Bob likes the i-th book and 0 otherwise. 

Output

If there is no solution, print only one integer -1. Otherwise print one integer T — the minimum total reading time of the suitable set of books.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
