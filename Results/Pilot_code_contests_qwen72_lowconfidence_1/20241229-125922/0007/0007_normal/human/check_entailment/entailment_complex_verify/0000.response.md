Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always find the optimal solution, particularly in scenarios where there are more than enough books that both Alice and Bob like, but also additional books that only one of them likes, which could potentially reduce the total reading time further.

Let's break down the specific issue using the provided example:

### Example Input:
```
8 4
7 1 1
2 1 1
4 0 1
8 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 0 1
3 1 0
```

### Expected Output:
```
17
```

### Actual Output:
```
18
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `n = 8`, `k = 4`
   - Books: 
     - (7, 1, 1)
     - (2, 1, 1)
     - (4, 0, 1)
     - (8, 1, 1)
     - (1, 0, 1)
     - (1, 1, 1)
     - (1, 0, 1)
     - (3, 1, 0)

2. **Sorting by Time**:
   - Sorted books by time: 
     - (1, 0, 1)
     - (1, 1, 1)
     - (1, 0, 1)
     - (2, 1, 1)
     - (3, 1, 0)
     - (4, 0, 1)
     - (7, 1, 1)
     - (8, 1, 1)

3. **Processing Books**:
   - The program processes the books in order of increasing time.
   - It selects books that both Alice and Bob like until both have `k` books.
   - It then selects books that only Alice or Bob likes if needed.

4. **Issue**:
   - When the program encounters the book with time `3` and liked by Alice (`3, 1, 0`), it does not consider replacing a book that both Alice and Bob like with this book and another book that only Bob likes.
   - Specifically, the program does not replace the book with time `7` (liked by both) with the book with time `3` (liked by Alice) and the book with time `1` (liked by Bob).

5. **Optimal Solution**:
   - The optimal solution should include the books with times `1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1` (total time `1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9`) and `1` (liked by Bob), resulting in a total time of `17`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic does not always ensure the minimal total reading time by considering all possible replacements of books that both Alice and Bob like with books that only one of them likes. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.
