Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are books that neither Alice nor Bob like. In such cases, the program might incorrectly include these books in the final selection, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2
3 0 0
2 1 0
3 1 0
5 0 1
3 0 1
```
In this case, the program should output `-1` because there are not enough books that both Alice and Bob like to meet the requirement of at least `k` books each. However, the program might incorrectly include the book with `t=3`, `a=0`, `b=0` in the final selection, leading to an incorrect result.

This is a specific edge case that the program does not handle correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
