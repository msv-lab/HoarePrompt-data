Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the integers `n` and `k` from the input, ensuring that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing three integers `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i`, where \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^4\) and \(0 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 1\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes lists `t`, `a`, and `b` to store the reading times, Alice's preferences, and Bob's preferences, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `alice` and `bob` to keep track of the number of books chosen for Alice and Bob, and lists `alice_only` and `bob_only` to store the indices of books chosen exclusively for Alice and Bob.
   - A list `taken` is used to mark which books are chosen.

3. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The books are sorted by their reading times (`t_i`).
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects books based on the following rules:
     - If both Alice and Bob like the book and neither has reached the required `k` books, the book is chosen.
     - If both Alice and Bob like the book but both have already reached `k` books, the program checks if the current book can replace a previously chosen book to minimize the total reading time.
     - If only Alice likes the book and she hasn't reached `k` books, the book is chosen.
     - If only Bob likes the book and he hasn't reached `k` books, the book is chosen.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After processing all books, the program checks if both Alice and Bob have exactly `k` books.
   - If both have `k` books, the program calculates the total reading time of the chosen books and prints it.
   - If either Alice or Bob does not have `k` books, the program prints `-1`.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq t_i \leq 10^4\).
- It correctly handles the case where it is impossible to choose `k` books that both Alice and Bob like.
- The program ensures that the total reading time is minimized by replacing higher time books with lower time books when possible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result according to the specified requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
