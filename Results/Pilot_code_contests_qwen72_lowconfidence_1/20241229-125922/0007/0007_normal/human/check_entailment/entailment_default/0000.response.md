Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to ensure that both Alice and Bob like at least `k` books in the chosen set. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Books Liked by Both**:
   - The code tries to optimize the selection by replacing higher time items with lower time items when possible. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of books liked by both Alice and Bob is less than `k`. In such cases, it might incorrectly replace books that are liked by both with books that are liked by only one of them, leading to a situation where one of them ends up with fewer than `k` books.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle the edge case where there are not enough books that both Alice and Bob like to reach `k` books for each. For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     5 3
     1 1 0
     2 1 0
     3 0 1
     4 0 1
     5 0 0
     ```
     In this case, there are only 2 books liked by Alice and 2 books liked by Bob, making it impossible to select 3 books for each. The code should print `-1`, but it does not handle this case correctly.

3. **Optimization Logic**:
   - The optimization logic where the code replaces higher time items with lower time items is flawed. It might replace a book liked by both with a book liked by only one, which can lead to an incorrect result. For example, consider the following input:
     ```
     8 4
     7 1 1
     2 1 1
     4 0 1
     8 1 1
     1 0 1
     1 1 1
     1 0 1
     3 0 0
     ```
     The optimal solution is to select books 1, 2, 5, and 6, which gives a total time of 18. However, the code might replace book 1 with book 7, leading to an incorrect result.

To ensure the correctness of the program, the logic needs to be revised to correctly handle the selection of books liked by both Alice and Bob, and to ensure that the total number of books liked by each reaches `k` without replacing books that are liked by both with books that are liked by only one.
