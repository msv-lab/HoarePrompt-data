Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are more than enough books that both Alice and Bob like, but also additional books that only one of them likes, which could potentially reduce the total reading time further.

For example, consider the following input:
```
8 4
7 1 1
2 1 1
4 0 1
8 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 0 1
3 0 0
```

In this case, the program outputs `18`, which is correct. However, consider a slightly modified input:
```
8 4
7 1 1
2 1 1
4 0 1
8 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 0 1
3 1 0
```

Here, the program still outputs `18`. However, the correct output should be `17` because the book with time `3` and liked by Alice can be included instead of one of the books with time `7` or `8`.

The issue arises because the program does not always replace a book that both Alice and Bob like with two books that only one of them likes, even if doing so would reduce the total reading time. This edge case demonstrates that the program does not always find the optimal solution.
