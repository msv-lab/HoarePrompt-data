The code initializes a list named `taken` with `n` elements, where each element is set to 0. This impacts the `taken` list specifically.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is an empty list, `alice` is 0, `bob` is 0, `bob_only` is an empty list, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros**
