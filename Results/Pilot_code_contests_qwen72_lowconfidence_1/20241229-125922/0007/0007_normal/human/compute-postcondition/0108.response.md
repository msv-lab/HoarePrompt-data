Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before. If `alice == k`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, and the state of `taken` remains unchanged. If `alice == k` and `alice_only` is not empty, the last element `j` from `alice_only` is removed, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, while all other elements in `taken` remain unchanged. If `alice == k` and `alice_only` is empty, the state remains unchanged.***
