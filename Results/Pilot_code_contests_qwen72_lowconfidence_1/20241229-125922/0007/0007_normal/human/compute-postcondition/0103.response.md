Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before. If `alice == k` and `bob == k`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is true and `bob < k`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and all other elements in `taken` remain unchanged. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`.***
