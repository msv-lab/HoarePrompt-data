To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The lists `t`, `a`, and `b` are initially empty.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` from the input and appends them to the lists `t`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

3. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `n` times, as specified by the range.
   - After each iteration, the lists `t`, `a`, and `b` grow by one element.
   - Therefore, after `n` iterations, the list `t` will contain `n` elements, each being the corresponding `ti` read from the input.
   - Similarly, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, each being the corresponding `ai` read from the input.
   - The list `b` will contain `n` elements, each being the corresponding `bi` read from the input.
   - The variables `n` and `k` will retain their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input.**
