The code snippet `j = alice_only.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `alice_only`. This impacts the value of `j` and the contents of `alice_only`.

- `j` is now assigned the last element of `alice_only`.
- `alice_only` loses its last element.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `alice`, `bob`, `bob_only`, `alice_only`, `i`, `ti`, `taken`) remain unchanged unless they were affected by the changes to `alice_only` or `j`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before but with its last element removed, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before, `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`.**
