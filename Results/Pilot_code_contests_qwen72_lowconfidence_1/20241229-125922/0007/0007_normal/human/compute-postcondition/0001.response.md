The code initializes an empty list named `t`. This action does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain integers read from the input within the specified range. The values of `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are also not affected, as they are part of the initial state and the code snippet does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each of the next n lines contains three integers t_i, a_i, and b_i, where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1. `t` is an empty list.**
