Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob, `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `ti` for all indices `i` in `ts` where `taken[i]` is 1. If `ts` is empty or no `i` in `ts` satisfies `taken[i] == 1`, `ans` remains 0.**
