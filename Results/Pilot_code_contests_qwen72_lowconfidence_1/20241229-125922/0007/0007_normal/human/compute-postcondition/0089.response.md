The given Python code snippet appends the current index `i` to the list `alice_only`. This operation does not depend on the values of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, nor does it affect `bob`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `bob_only`, or `taken`. The only change is that `alice_only` is updated.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero: - If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is non-empty, `bob_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`. - If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is empty, no changes occur. - If `bob != k`, `bob` is incremented by 1, `alice` remains unchanged, and `taken[i]` is set to 1. If `a[i]` or `b[i]` is zero, no changes occur. `alice` is `alice + 1`. `alice_only` is `alice_only` with `i` appended.**
