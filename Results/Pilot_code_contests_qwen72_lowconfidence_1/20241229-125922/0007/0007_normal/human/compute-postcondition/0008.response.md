The code snippet `b.append(bi)` adds the value `bi` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `b` was an empty list, and now it contains the element `bi`. The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `ti`, and `ai` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi]`, `ti` is an input integer, `ai` is an input integer, `bi` is an input integer**
