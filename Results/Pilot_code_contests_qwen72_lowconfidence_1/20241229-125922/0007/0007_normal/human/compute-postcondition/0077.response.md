Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, read from the input, and `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty. If `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. If `alice_only` is empty, no changes occur.***
