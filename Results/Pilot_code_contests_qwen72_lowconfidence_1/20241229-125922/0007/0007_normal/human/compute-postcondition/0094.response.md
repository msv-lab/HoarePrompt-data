The code snippet `taken[i] = 1` sets the element at index `i` in the list `taken` to 1. This operation only affects the `taken` list and does not change the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `alice`, `bob`, or `bob_only`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `taken` is a list where `taken[i]` is 1, and all other elements remain unchanged.**
