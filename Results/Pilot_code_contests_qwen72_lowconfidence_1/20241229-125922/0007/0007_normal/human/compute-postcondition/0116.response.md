Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are true and `bob < k`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and all other elements in `taken` remain unchanged. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`. If `a[i]` or `b[i]` is false, `taken` remains unchanged and `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`.***
