The code `alice_only.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `alice_only`. This modifies the `alice_only` list, adding one more element to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `alice + 1`, `bob` is as before, `alice_only` contains one additional element `i`, `bob_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` remains unchanged.**
