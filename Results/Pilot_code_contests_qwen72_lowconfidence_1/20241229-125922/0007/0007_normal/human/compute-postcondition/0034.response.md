Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. If `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, then `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists with one fewer element each, and the element at index 0 in `taken` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
