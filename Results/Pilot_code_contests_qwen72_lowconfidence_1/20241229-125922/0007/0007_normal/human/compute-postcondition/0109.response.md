The code snippet provided is:

```python
j = bob_only.pop()
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Impact of the Code**: The code removes the last element from the list `bob_only` and assigns this value to the variable `j`.
2. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each.
   - `alice`, `bob`, `bob_only`, `alice_only`, `i`, `ti`, and `taken` are as described in the initial state.
3. **Calculate the Result**:
   - The variable `j` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `bob_only`.
   - The list `bob_only` is modified by removing its last element.

### Updated State:
- `j` is now the last element of the original `bob_only`.
- `bob_only` is now one element shorter, having had its last element removed.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is the original `bob_only` list with its last element removed, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before, `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`.**
