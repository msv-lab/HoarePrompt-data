Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is 0, `bob_only` is an empty list, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. If `alice_only` is non-empty, it has one fewer element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. Otherwise, `alice_only` remains an empty list and `taken` remains a list of `n` zeros.***
