To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- Each of the next `n` lines contains three integers `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i`, where 1 ≤ `t_i` ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ `a_i`, `b_i` ≤ 1.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `b` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given as an integer and it is constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, we know that `n` is always at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.
2. **Initialization of Variables**: The lists `t`, `a`, and `b` are initially empty. However, these lists will be populated within the loop body, which is not shown. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
3. **Index Variable**: The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop starts.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, this is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is an empty list, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list**
