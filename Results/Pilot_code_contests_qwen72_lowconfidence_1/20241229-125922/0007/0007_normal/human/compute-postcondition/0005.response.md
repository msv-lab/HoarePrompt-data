The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `ti`, `ai`, and `bi`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the lists `t`, `a`, and `b` remain empty.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is an empty list, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `ti` is an input integer, `ai` is an input integer, `bi` is an input integer**
