The code snippet `ans += ti` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `ti`. Given that `ti` is the second value of `ts`, which must contain at least two elements, `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob, `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise, `ans` is `ti`, `i` is the second index of `ts`, `ti` is the second value of `ts`.**
