Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is a list that may be non-empty, `alice` is incremented by 1 if `alice` was not equal to `k`, otherwise `alice` remains `k` and `bob` is set to 0, `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element plus the new element 0 if `b[i]` is non-zero and `bob` is less than `k`. `taken` is a list of `n` integers, with `taken[0]` set to 1 if `b[i]` is non-zero and `bob` is less than `k`. `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero if `b[i]` is non-zero and `bob` is less than `k`. `bob` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `k` if `b[i]` is non-zero and `bob` is less than `k`. If `alice` is `k` and `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` has one fewer element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. If `alice` and `bob` are both equal to `k`, and `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists and `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, then `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists with one fewer element each, and the element at index 0 in `taken` is set to 1. If `bob` is equal to `k`, `bob` remains `k` and `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty, and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element plus the new element 0. If `b[i]` is zero, none of the above changes occur.***
