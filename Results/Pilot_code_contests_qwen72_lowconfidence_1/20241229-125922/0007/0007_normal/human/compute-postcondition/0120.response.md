Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` is true and `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `alice_only` contains one additional element `i`, `taken` has the element at index `i` set to 1, and `bob` and `bob_only` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` is false or `alice >= k`, `taken` remains unchanged, and `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`.***
