Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `b[i]` is true and `bob < k`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and `bob_only` contains an additional element `i`. Otherwise, `taken` remains unchanged, and `alice`, `alice_only`, `bob`, and `bob_only` remain unchanged.***
