Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before. If `alice_only` is not empty, its last element `j` is removed, and `taken[j]` is set to 0. All other elements in `taken` remain unchanged. If `alice_only` is empty, the state remains unchanged.***
