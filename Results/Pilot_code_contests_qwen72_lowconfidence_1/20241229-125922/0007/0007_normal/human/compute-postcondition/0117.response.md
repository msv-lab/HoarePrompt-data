The code snippet `alice += 1` increments the value of the variable `alice` by 1. The values of other variables such as `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `bob`, `alice_only`, `bob_only`, `i`, `ti`, and `taken` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `alice + 1`, `bob` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` remains unchanged.**
