The given Python code snippet appends the current value of `i` to the list `bob_only`.

- `n` and `k` remain integers within the specified range.
- `t`, `a`, and `b` remain lists containing `n` elements each.
- The conditions for updating `alice`, `alice_only`, and `taken` are not directly affected by this snippet.
- `bob` is not directly modified by this snippet.
- `bob_only` is appended with the current value of `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `bob_only` contains an additional element `i`, `alice`, `alice_only`, `taken`, and `bob` remain unchanged.**
