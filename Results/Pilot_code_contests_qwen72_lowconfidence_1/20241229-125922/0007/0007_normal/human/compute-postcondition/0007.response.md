The value of `ai` is appended to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` was an empty list, so now `a` contains one element, which is `ai`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `b`, `ti`, `bi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai]`, `b` is an empty list, `ti` is an input integer, `ai` is an input integer, `bi` is an input integer**
