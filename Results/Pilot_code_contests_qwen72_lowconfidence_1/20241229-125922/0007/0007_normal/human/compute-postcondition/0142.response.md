Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. `alice` is the number of items chosen for Alice, and `bob` is the number of items chosen for Bob, both of which are at most `k`. `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, and `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob. `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise. If `alice` is not equal to `k` or `bob` is not equal to `k`, `-1` has been printed. Otherwise, if `alice` and `bob` are both `k`, `ans` is the sum of `ti` for all indices `i` in `ts` where `taken[i]` is 1. If `ts` is empty or no `i` in `ts` satisfies `taken[i] == 1`, `ans` remains 0. The value of `ans` has been printed.***
