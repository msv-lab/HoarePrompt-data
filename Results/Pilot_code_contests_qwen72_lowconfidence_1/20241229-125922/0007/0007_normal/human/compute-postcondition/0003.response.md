The code snippet initializes an empty list `b`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, or `a`, which remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each of the next n lines contains three integers t_i, a_i, and b_i, where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1. `t` is an empty list. `a` is an empty list. `b` is an empty list.**
