The value of `ans` is incremented by `ti`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob, `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise, `ans` is `ti`, `ts` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first index of `ts`, `ti` is the first value of `ts`. The item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob (`taken[i]` is 1).**
