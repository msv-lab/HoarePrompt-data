The code snippet `taken[bob_only.pop()] = 0` performs the following actions:

1. **Popping an Element from `bob_only`**: An element is removed from the list `bob_only`. Since `bob_only` is a non-empty list, this operation is valid and results in the removal of the last element in `bob_only`.

2. **Setting an Element in `taken` to 0**: The index obtained from the popped element of `bob_only` is used to set the corresponding element in the list `taken` to 0. The list `taken` initially contains `n` zeros except for the element at the index `index_popped`.

Given these actions, let's update the state:

- The length of `bob_only` is reduced by 1.
- The element in `taken` at the index that was popped from `bob_only` is set to 0. Since `taken` initially contains `n` zeros with the element at the index `index_popped` set to 0, setting another element to 0 does not change its value if it was already 0.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `bob_only` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at the index `index_popped` set to 0, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. Additionally, `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`.**
