The code initializes an empty list named `alice_only`. This action does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, or `b`. The only change is the creation of the new variable `alice_only`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is an empty list.**
