The provided code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs `-1`. This operation does not alter any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. `alice` is the number of items chosen for Alice, and `bob` is the number of items chosen for Bob, both of which are at most `k`. `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, and `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob. `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise. The current values of `alice` and `bob` are such that either `alice` is not equal to `k` or `bob` is not equal to `k`. `-1` has been printed.**
