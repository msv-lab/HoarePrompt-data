The code snippet `t.append(ti)` adds the value of `ti` to the end of the list `t`. Given that `t` was initially an empty list, after executing this line of code, `t` will contain a single element, which is the value of `ti`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti]`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `ti` is an input integer, `ai` is an input integer, `bi` is an input integer**
