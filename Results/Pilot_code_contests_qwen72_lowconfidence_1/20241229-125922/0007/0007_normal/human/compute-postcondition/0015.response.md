The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `ti`, `ai`, and `bi`. The initial state includes lists `t`, `a`, and `b` each containing two elements `[ti, ti]`, `[ai, ai]`, and `[bi, bi]` respectively. After executing the code, these lists will contain the new values of `ti`, `ai`, and `bi`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are the integers read from the input.**
