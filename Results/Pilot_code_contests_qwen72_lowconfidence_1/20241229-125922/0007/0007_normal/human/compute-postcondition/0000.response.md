The code reads a line from the standard input, splits it by spaces, and converts the resulting strings into integers, assigning these integers to `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Each of the next n lines contains three integers t_i, a_i, and b_i, where 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1.**
