The value `bi` is appended to the list `b`. Initially, `b` contains `[bi, bi]`. After appending another `bi`, the list `b` becomes `[bi, bi, bi]`.

The values of `n`, `k`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi, bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are integers read from the input.**
