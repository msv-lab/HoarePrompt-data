Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is an empty list, `alice` is 0, `bob` is 0, `bob_only` is an empty list, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. Additionally, `alice` is equal to `k` and `bob` is equal to `k`. Both `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists.***
