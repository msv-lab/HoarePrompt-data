Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice_only` and `bob_only` are lists that may be non-empty. If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is non-empty, `bob_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`. If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is empty, no changes occur. If `bob != k`, `bob` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `alice` remains unchanged.***
