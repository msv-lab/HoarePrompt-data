The value of `alice` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `alice + 1`, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `alice + 1`, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before.**
