The code snippet sorts the indices of the list `t` based on the values in `t`. The sorting is stored in `ts` as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the original index and the corresponding value from `t`, sorted by the value.

- `ts` is now a list of tuples where each tuple is `(index, value)`, sorted by `value`.
- The rest of the variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `alice_only`, `alice`, `bob`, `bob_only`, `taken`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is an empty list, `alice` is 0, `bob` is 0, `bob_only` is an empty list, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t`**.
