The provided Python code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `ti`, `ai`, and `bi`. The lists `t`, `a`, and `b` are updated with these new values. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists initially containing one element each (`ti`, `ai`, and `bi`).

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will reflect the changes in the values of `ti`, `ai`, and `bi`:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are input integers**.
