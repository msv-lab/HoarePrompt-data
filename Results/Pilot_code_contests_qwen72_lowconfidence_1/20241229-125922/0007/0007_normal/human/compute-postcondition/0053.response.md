Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is an empty list, `alice` is `alice + 1` if `alice` was not equal to `k`, otherwise `alice` is `k` and `bob` is 0, `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty, and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros, with `taken[j]` set to 0 if `bob_only` was non-empty, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`. `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. If `alice` is `k` and `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` has one fewer element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. If `alice` and `bob` are both equal to `k`, and `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists and `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, then `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists with one fewer element each, and the element at index 0 in `taken` is set to 1. If `bob` is equal to `k`, `bob` remains `k` and `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty, and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element. If `bob` is not equal to `k`, `bob` is incremented by 1 and is not equal to `k`.***
