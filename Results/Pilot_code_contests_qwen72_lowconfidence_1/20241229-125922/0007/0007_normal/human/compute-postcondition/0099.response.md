The code snippet `taken[i] = 1` updates the value of the element at index `i` in the list `taken` to 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, the last element of `bob_only` is removed, and the corresponding index in `taken` is set to 0. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`. `taken[i]` is 1.**
