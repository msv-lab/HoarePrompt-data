The line of code `taken[alice_only.pop()] = 0` impacts the `taken` list and the `alice_only` stack. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **`alice_only.pop()`**: This operation removes and returns the last element from the `alice_only` stack. Let's denote this element as `index`. After this operation, the `alice_only` stack has one less element.
   
2. **`taken[index] = 0`**: This operation sets the element at position `index` in the `taken` list to 0. The rest of the `taken` list remains unchanged.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `bob`, `bob_only`, `i`, `ti`, and `ts`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before. The last element of `alice_only` is removed, and the corresponding index in `taken` is set to 0. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`.**
