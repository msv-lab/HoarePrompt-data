The value `ti` is appended to the list `t`. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are input integers.**
