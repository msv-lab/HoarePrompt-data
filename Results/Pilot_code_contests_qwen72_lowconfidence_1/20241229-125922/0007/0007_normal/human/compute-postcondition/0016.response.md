The code snippet `t.append(ti)` appends the value `ti` to the list `t`. The list `t` initially contains `[ti, ti]`, and after appending `ti`, the list `t` will contain `[ti, ti, ti]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are the integers read from the input.**
