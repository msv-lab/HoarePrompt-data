The value `bi` is appended to the list `b`. The lists `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and the values of `n` and `k` also remain unchanged. The updated list `b` now contains `[bi, bi]`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are input integers.**
