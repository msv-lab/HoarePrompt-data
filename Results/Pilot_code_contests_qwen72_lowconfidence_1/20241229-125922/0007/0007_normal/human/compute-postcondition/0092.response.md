The code snippet `bob += 1` increments the value of `bob` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob` is now `bob + 1`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and all other conditions and actions described in the initial state remain valid. If `a[i]` is zero or `alice` is not less than `k`, no changes occur.**
