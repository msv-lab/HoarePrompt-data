The code snippet `taken[i] = 1` updates the list `taken` by setting the element at index `i` to 1. This change affects only the `taken` list and does not alter the values of other variables.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `alice + 1`, `bob` is as before, `alice_only` contains one additional element `i`, `bob_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` has the element at index `i` set to 1.**
