The value of `ai` is appended to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains `[ai, ai]`, and after appending another `ai`, the list `a` will contain `[ai, ai, ai]`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti, ti]`.
- `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi]`.
- `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi, bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are integers read from the input.**
