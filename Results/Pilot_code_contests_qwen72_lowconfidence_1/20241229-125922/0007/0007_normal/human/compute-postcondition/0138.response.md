The value of `ans` is incremented by `ti`. The value of `ti` is the third value of the list `ts`, which is a specific value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob, `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise, `ans` is `ti`, `i` is the third index of `ts`, `ti` is the third value of `ts`.**
