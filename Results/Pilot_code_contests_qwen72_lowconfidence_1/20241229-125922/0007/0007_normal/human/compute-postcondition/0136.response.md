Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob, `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise, `ans` is 0, `ts` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second index of `ts`, `ti` is the second value of `ts`. If `taken[i]` is 1, `ans` is set to `ti`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
