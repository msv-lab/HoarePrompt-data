The `continue` statement in Python causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables directly. However, it affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

- `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each.
- `alice_only` and `bob_only` retain their current states (non-empty or empty).
- If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is non-empty, `bob_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`.
- If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is empty, no changes occur.
- If `bob != k`, `bob` is incremented by 1.
- `alice` remains unchanged.
- `taken[i]` is set to 1.

The `continue` statement itself does not change these conditions but indicates that the loop should proceed to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice_only` and `bob_only` retain their current states (non-empty or empty), if `bob == k` and `bob_only` is non-empty, `bob_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`, if `bob == k` and `bob_only` is empty, no changes occur, if `bob != k`, `bob` is incremented by 1, `alice` remains unchanged, `taken[i]` is set to 1**
