The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely expects some form of input that includes `n`, `k`, and a list or sequence of tuples or lists containing `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` for each of the `n` entries. 

Given this, the function `func` is designed to work with the following parameters:
- `n` and `k`: Both are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- A sequence (list or similar) of length `n` where each element is a tuple or list containing three integers: `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i`, with constraints 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1.

The function's return value is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot accurately describe what the function returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it might return a computed result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function `func` accepts two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a sequence of `n` elements, each containing three integers `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i` (with 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^4 and 0 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters.**
