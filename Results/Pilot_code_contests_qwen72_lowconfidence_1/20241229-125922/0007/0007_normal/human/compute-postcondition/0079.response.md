Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, read from the input, and `alice_only` and `bob_only` are lists that may be non-empty. If `alice` is `k` and `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. If `alice` is not `k`, `alice` is incremented by 1. If `alice` and `bob` are both equal to `k` and `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists and `ti` (the value part of the second tuple in `ts`) is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, then `alice_only` and `bob_only` each lose their last element, and the element at index 0 in `taken` is set to 1. Additionally, the element at the index corresponding to the removed element in `alice_only` in `taken` is set to 0, and the element at the index corresponding to the removed element in `bob_only` in `taken` is set to 0. If `ti` is not less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, no changes occur. If `alice` is `k` and `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` has one fewer element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`. If `b[i]` is non-zero and `bob` is less than `k`, `bob` is incremented by 1, and `taken[1]` is set to 1. If `b[i]` is zero, none of the above changes occur.***
