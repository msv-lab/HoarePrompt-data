The code `a.append(ai)` appends the integer `ai` to the list `a`. This operation changes the content of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `[ti, ti]`, `a` is a list containing `[ai, ai]`, `b` is a list containing `[bi]`, `ti`, `ai`, and `bi` are input integers.**
