The code snippet `taken[i] = 1` changes the value of the `taken` list at the index `i` from 0 to 1. Since `i` is 0 initially, the first element of `taken` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `alice` is `k`, `bob` is `k`, `bob_only` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, `taken` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at the index 0 set to 1, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero. Additionally, `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`.**
