The code snippet `alice += 1` increments the value of `alice` by 1. No other variables or conditions are directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change in the state is the increment of `alice`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero: 
- If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is non-empty, `bob_only` loses its last element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `bob_only`.
- If `bob == k` and `bob_only` is empty, no changes occur.
- If `bob != k`, `bob` is incremented by 1, `alice` remains unchanged, and `taken[i]` is set to 1.
If `a[i]` or `b[i]` is zero, no changes occur. `alice` is `alice + 1`.**
