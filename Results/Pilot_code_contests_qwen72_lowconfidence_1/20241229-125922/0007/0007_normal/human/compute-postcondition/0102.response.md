The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables in the current iteration, and the program continues from the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet:

- `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each.
- `alice`, `bob`, `alice_only`, and `bob_only` are as defined in the initial state.
- If `alice_only` and `bob_only` are both true and `ti < alice_only[-1] + bob_only[-1]`, the last element of `bob_only` is removed, the corresponding index in `taken` is set to 0, and `taken[i]` is set to 1. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`.
- If `alice_only` and `bob_only` are both true but `ti` is not less than `alice_only[-1] + bob_only[-1]`, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter any of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before.**
