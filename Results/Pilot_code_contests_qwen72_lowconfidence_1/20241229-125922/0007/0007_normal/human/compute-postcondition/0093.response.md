The provided Python code snippet `bob_only.append(i)` appends the current index `i` to the list `bob_only`. Based on the initial state and the given conditions, let's analyze the impact of this code:

- The condition checks if `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice < k`.
- If these conditions are met, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob` is incremented by 1, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and `i` is appended to `bob_only`.
- If the conditions are not met, no changes occur.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each.
- If `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob` is now `bob + 1`, `taken[i]` is set to 1.
- If `a[i]` is zero or `alice` is not less than `k`, no changes occur.

After executing `bob_only.append(i)`, the following changes occur:
- `i` is appended to the list `bob_only`.

The output state remains consistent with the initial state, with the additional change to `bob_only`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob` is now `bob + 1`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and `i` is appended to `bob_only`. If `a[i]` is zero or `alice` is not less than `k`, no changes occur.**
