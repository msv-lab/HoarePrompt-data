The code snippet `j = alice_only.pop()` removes the last element from the list `alice_only` and assigns this value to the variable `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, read from the input.
- `alice_only` and `bob_only` are lists that may be non-empty.

After executing the code:
- The last element of `alice_only` is removed.
- The variable `j` is assigned the value of the last element that was removed from `alice_only`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged, including the values of `n`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `bob_only`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, read from the input, `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty, `alice_only` is a list with one fewer element, `j` is the value of the last element removed from `alice_only`**.
