Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before. If `b[i]` is true and `bob < k`, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and all other elements in `taken` remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes occur to any variables or lists.***
