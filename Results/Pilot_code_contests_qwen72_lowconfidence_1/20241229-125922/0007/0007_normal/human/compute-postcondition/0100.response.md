Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `bob_only` is as before. If `ti < alice_only[-1] + bob_only[-1]`, the last element of `bob_only` is removed, the corresponding index in `taken` is set to 0, and `taken[i]` is set to 1. `i` and `ti` are updated to the next pair in `ts`. If `ti` is not less than `alice_only[-1] + bob_only[-1]`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
