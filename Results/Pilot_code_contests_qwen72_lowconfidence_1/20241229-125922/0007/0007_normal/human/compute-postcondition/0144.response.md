Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by `n` lines each containing three integers `t_i`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. It then processes these inputs to select up to `k` items for Alice and up to `k` items for Bob, ensuring that the total time (sum of `t_i` values) is minimized. The function prints the minimum total time if exactly `k` items can be selected for both Alice and Bob; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function handles the following edge cases and ensures the following final state: 

- If `n` and `k` do not satisfy the constraints \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the behavior is undefined.
- If there are not enough items that can be selected for both Alice and Bob to reach `k` items each, the function prints `-1`.
- If there are multiple ways to select items such that both Alice and Bob get `k` items, the function ensures that the total time is minimized by replacing higher time items with lower time items when possible.
- The final state of the program includes:
  - `n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each.
  - `alice` and `bob` are the number of items chosen for Alice and Bob, respectively, both of which are at most `k`.
  - `alice_only` and `bob_only` are lists containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice and Bob, respectively.
  - `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise.
  - If `alice` is not equal to `k` or `bob` is not equal to `k`, `-1` is printed.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is the sum of `t_i` for all indices `i` in `ts` where `taken[i]` is 1, and this value is printed. **
