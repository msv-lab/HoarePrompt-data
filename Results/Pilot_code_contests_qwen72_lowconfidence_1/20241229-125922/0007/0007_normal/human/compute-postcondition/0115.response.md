The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, since the initial state already specifies the changes made by the line `taken[i] = 1`, and no further changes are made by the `continue` statement, the only effect is that the current iteration is skipped. The state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state described.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each, `alice` is as before, `bob` is as before, `alice_only` is as before, `bob_only` is as before, `i` and `ti` are as before, `taken` is as before except `taken[i]` is 1.**
