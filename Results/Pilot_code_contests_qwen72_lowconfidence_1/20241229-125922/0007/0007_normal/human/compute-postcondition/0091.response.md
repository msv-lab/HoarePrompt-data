Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. If `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice < k`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob` remains unchanged, `taken[i]` is set to 1, and all other conditions and actions described in the initial state remain valid. If `a[i]` is zero or `alice` is not less than `k`, no changes occur.***
