The code snippet `alice_only.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `alice_only`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, this means 0 is added to `alice_only`.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `alice_only` now contains one additional element, which is `0`.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `t` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ti` read from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `ai` read from the input, `b` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an integer `bi` read from the input, `alice_only` is a list that may be non-empty and now contains an additional element `0`, `alice` is incremented by 1, `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element, `taken` is a list of `n` integers, with `taken[i]` set to 1, `ts` is a list of tuples (index, value) sorted by the values in `t` and must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `ti` is the value part of the first tuple in `ts`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both non-zero, if `alice` is `k` and `alice_only` is non-empty, `alice_only` has one fewer element, and `taken[j]` is set to 0, where `j` is the last element of the original `alice_only`, if `alice` and `bob` are both equal to `k`, and `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists and `ti` is less than the sum of the last elements of `alice_only` and `bob_only`, then `alice_only` and `bob_only` are non-empty lists with one fewer element each, and the element at index 0 in `taken` is set to 1, if `bob` is equal to `k`, `bob` remains `k` and `bob_only` is a list that may be non-empty, and if it is non-empty, it has one fewer element, if `bob` is not equal to `k`, `bob` is incremented by 1 and is not equal to `k`, `a[i]` is non-zero and `alice` is less than or equal to `k`**
