Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `t`, `a`, and `b` are lists containing `n` elements each. `alice` is the number of items chosen for Alice, and `bob` is the number of items chosen for Bob, both of which are at most `k`. `alice_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Alice, and `bob_only` is a list containing indices of items chosen exclusively for Bob. `taken` is a list of `n` integers where `taken[i]` is 1 if the item at index `i` has been chosen for either Alice or Bob, and 0 otherwise. If `alice` and `bob` are both `k`, and there are items that could potentially replace items in `alice_only` and `bob_only` to reduce the total time, such replacements have been made.**
