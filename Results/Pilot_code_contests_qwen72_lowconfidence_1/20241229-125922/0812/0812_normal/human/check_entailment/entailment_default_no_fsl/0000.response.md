Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible value `mink` in all cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate `numspacesremaining` and subsequently `mink` is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Calculation of `numspacesremaining`:**
   - The current implementation calculates `numspacesremaining` as `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`.
   - This formula assumes that the maximum number of people on any bench can be uniformly distributed across the other benches, which is not always accurate. For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `m = 6`, and `a = [1, 6, 5]`. The sorted array `asort` is `[6, 5, 1]`. According to the formula:
     - `numspacesremaining = 6 * (3 - 1) - (5 + 1) = 12 - 6 = 6`.
     - However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the distribution of people correctly.

2. **Distribution of People:**
   - The program needs to ensure that the additional people are distributed in a way that minimizes the maximum number of people on any bench. This involves a more complex algorithm to balance the distribution.
   - The current logic does not handle this distribution correctly, leading to incorrect `mink` values in many cases.

3. **Example Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     6
     1
     6
     5
     ```
   - The expected output is `6 12`, but the program calculates `mink` incorrectly due to the flawed `numspacesremaining` calculation.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to distribute the additional people in a way that minimizes the maximum number of people on any bench. This typically involves a greedy algorithm or a binary search approach to find the minimum possible `k`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
