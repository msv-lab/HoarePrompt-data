Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly calculate both the minimum and maximum possible values of \( k \), the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after the additional \( m \) people come to the park. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of benches \( n \) and the number of additional people \( m \).
   - It then reads the initial number of people on each bench into the list \( a \).

2. **Calculating Minimum Possible \( k \):**
   - The program sorts the list \( a \) in descending order to get \( asort \).
   - It calculates the total number of spaces remaining on all benches except the most crowded one using \( numspacesremaining \).
   - If the number of additional people \( m \) is less than or equal to the available spaces, the minimum \( k \) is the maximum number of people already on any bench.
   - If \( m \) is greater than the available spaces, it distributes the remaining people across all benches, ensuring the minimum possible increase in the maximum occupancy.

3. **Calculating Maximum Possible \( k \):**
   - The maximum possible \( k \) is simply the current maximum number of people on any bench plus the total number of additional people \( m \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum and maximum possible values of \( k \).

The logic and calculations used in the program align with the problem description and handle various edge cases, such as when there is only one bench or when the number of additional people is very large. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
