Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues and explanations:

### Maximum Possible \( k \) Calculation
The program calculates the maximum possible \( k \) correctly as:
\[ \text{maxk} = \max(a) + m \]
This is correct because the maximum number of people on any bench can be achieved by adding all \( m \) people to the bench with the highest initial count.

### Minimum Possible \( k \) Calculation
The program attempts to calculate the minimum possible \( k \) using a complex formula:
```python
asort = sorted(a, reverse=True)
numspacesremaining = asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])
if (m <= numspacesremaining) :
    mink = max(asort)
else :
    mink = max(asort) + max(math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)), 0)
```
However, this approach is overly complicated and does not always yield the correct result. A simpler and more reliable method to find the minimum possible \( k \) is to distribute the \( m \) people as evenly as possible among the \( n \) benches.

### Correct Approach for Minimum Possible \( k \)
To find the minimum possible \( k \):
1. Sort the list \( a \) in ascending order.
2. Distribute the \( m \) people one by one starting from the bench with the fewest people until all \( m \) people are seated.
3. The minimum possible \( k \) is the maximum number of people on any bench after this distribution.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = [int(sys.stdin.readline()) for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    a.sort()
    
    # Distribute m people as evenly as possible
    for i in range(m):
        a[0] += 1
        a.sort()
    
    # The minimum possible k is the maximum number of people on any bench
    mink = max(a)
    
    # The maximum possible k is the maximum number of people on any bench plus m
    maxk = max(a) + m
    
    print(f"{mink} {maxk}")

# Example usage
# Uncomment the following line to test with sample input
# sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
- **Input Reading**: The program reads the input values for \( n \), \( m \), and the initial number of people on each bench.
- **Sorting**: The list \( a \) is sorted in ascending order to facilitate even distribution.
- **Distribution**: The program iterates \( m \) times, adding one person to the bench with the fewest people in each iteration. After each addition, the list is sorted again to maintain the order.
- **Minimum and Maximum Calculation**: The minimum possible \( k \) is the maximum value in the sorted list \( a \) after distributing \( m \) people. The maximum possible \( k \) is the maximum value in \( a \) plus \( m \).

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly calculates both the minimum and maximum possible \( k \) according to the problem description.
