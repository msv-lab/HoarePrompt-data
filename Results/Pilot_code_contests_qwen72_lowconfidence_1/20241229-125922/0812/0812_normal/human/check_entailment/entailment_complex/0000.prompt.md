You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that a_i people are currently sitting on the i-th bench. Another m people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of n available.

Let k be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k.

Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of benches in the park.

The second line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000) — the number of people additionally coming to the park.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the initial number of people on the i-th bench.

Output

Print the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k, where k is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park.

Note

In the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum k is 3. For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum k is 7. That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.

The second example has its minimum k equal to 15 and maximum k equal to 15, as there is just a single bench in the park and all 10 people will occupy it.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000, and a list of integers a_i of length n where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).
    asort = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    numspacesremaining = asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])
    if (m <= numspacesremaining) :
        mink = max(asort)
    else :
        mink = max(asort) + max(math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)), 0)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100), `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`. If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is `asort[0]`. Otherwise, `mink` is `max(asort[0], math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)))`.
    maxk = max(a) + m
    print(str(int(mink)) + ' ' + str(maxk))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads inputs `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000`, and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. It then calculates two values, `mink` and `maxk`, and prints them separated by a space. `mink` is determined based on the available space (`numspacesremaining`) calculated as the difference between the product of the largest element in `a` and `(n-1)` and the sum of the remaining elements in `a` when sorted in descending order. If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is set to the largest element in `a`; otherwise, `mink` is the largest element in `a` plus the ceiling of the quotient of the difference between `m` and `numspacesremaining` divided by `n`. `maxk` is simply the largest element in `a` plus `m`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 1 or `m` is 0, which should still be handled correctly by the function.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
