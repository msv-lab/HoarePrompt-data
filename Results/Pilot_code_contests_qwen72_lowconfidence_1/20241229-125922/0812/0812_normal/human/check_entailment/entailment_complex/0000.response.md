Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible \( k \) in all cases. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of `numspacesremaining`:**
   - The variable `numspacesremaining` is calculated as `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`. This formula attempts to determine the total number of additional people that can be seated without exceeding the current maximum occupancy of any bench.
   - However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum number of people on a bench can be uniformly distributed across all other benches. This is not always the case, especially when the distribution of people on the benches is uneven.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Minimum \( k \):**
   - The program uses the following logic to determine `mink`:
     ```python
     if (m <= numspacesremaining) :
         mink = max(asort)
     else :
         mink = max(asort) + max(math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)), 0)
     ```
   - This logic fails in scenarios where the distribution of people on the benches is such that the minimum \( k \) can be achieved by a different distribution strategy. For example, consider the case where the initial distribution of people is highly uneven.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
6
1
6
5
```

- **Expected Output:** The minimum possible \( k \) is 6 and the maximum possible \( k \) is 12.
- **Program Output:**
  - `numspacesremaining` is calculated as `6 * (3 - 1) - (6 + 5) = 12 - 11 = 1`.
  - Since `m = 6` is greater than `numspacesremaining = 1`, the program sets `mink` as:
    ```python
    mink = 6 + math.ceil((6 - 1) / 3) = 6 + 2 = 8
    ```
  - The program outputs `8 12`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `6 12`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly calculate the minimum possible \( k \), the program should:
1. Distribute the additional \( m \) people in such a way that the maximum number of people on any bench is minimized.
2. Use a binary search or a greedy algorithm to find the minimum possible \( k \).

For the maximum possible \( k \), the program correctly adds \( m \) to the maximum initial occupancy of any bench.

### Conclusion:

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for calculating the minimum possible \( k \) in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
