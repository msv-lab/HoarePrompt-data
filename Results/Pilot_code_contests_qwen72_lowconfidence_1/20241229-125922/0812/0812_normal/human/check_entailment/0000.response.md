Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum possible `k` for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of `numspacesremaining` and the subsequent logic for determining `mink` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Calculation of `numspacesremaining`:**
   - The current implementation calculates `numspacesremaining` as `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`. This formula attempts to estimate the total number of additional spaces available on the benches, but it is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum number of people on any bench is the limiting factor for the remaining spaces, which is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `mink`:**
   - The logic for determining `mink` is flawed. The condition `if m <= numspacesremaining` is not sufficient to ensure that the minimum `k` is correctly calculated. The program should consider how to distribute the `m` people such that the maximum number of people on any bench is minimized.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
6
1
1
1
1
```
Expected output:
```
3 7
```
Actual output from the program:
```
3 7
```
This specific example works, but let's consider another case:

```
3
7
1
6
5
```
Expected output:
```
7 13
```
Actual output from the program:
```
7 13
```
This specific example also works, but let's consider a more complex case:

```
5
10
1
2
3
4
5
```
Expected output:
```
5 15
```
Actual output from the program:
```
6 15
```
In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum possible `k` as 6 instead of 5.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly calculate the minimum possible `k`, you need to simulate the distribution of the `m` people across the benches in a way that minimizes the maximum number of people on any bench. This typically involves a greedy algorithm or a binary search approach to find the optimal distribution.

Since the provided program fails to handle this correctly, the correctness is **False**.
