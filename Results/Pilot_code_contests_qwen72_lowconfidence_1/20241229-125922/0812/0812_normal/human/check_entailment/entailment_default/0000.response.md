Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum possible `k` in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine `numspacesremaining` and subsequently `mink` is flawed. The calculation of `numspacesremaining` as `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])` does not accurately represent the available spaces across all benches. This leads to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
7
1
6
5
```
The expected output is:
```
7 13
```
However, the code will produce:
```
8 13
```
This is because the calculation of `numspacesremaining` incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of people on a bench can be distributed in a way that doesn't necessarily reflect the actual distribution of people across the benches. The logic should instead focus on distributing the additional people in a way that minimizes the maximum number of people on any bench, which is not achieved by the current implementation.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
