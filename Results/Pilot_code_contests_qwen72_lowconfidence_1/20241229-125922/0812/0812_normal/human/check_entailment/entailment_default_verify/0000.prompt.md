You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n benches in the Berland Central park. It is known that a_i people are currently sitting on the i-th bench. Another m people are coming to the park and each of them is going to have a seat on some bench out of n available.

Let k be the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park. Calculate the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k.

Nobody leaves the taken seat during the whole process.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of benches in the park.

The second line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000) — the number of people additionally coming to the park.

Each of the next n lines contains a single integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the initial number of people on the i-th bench.

Output

Print the minimum possible k and the maximum possible k, where k is the maximum number of people sitting on one bench after additional m people came to the park.

Note

In the first example, each of four benches is occupied by a single person. The minimum k is 3. For example, it is possible to achieve if two newcomers occupy the first bench, one occupies the second bench, one occupies the third bench, and two remaining — the fourth bench. The maximum k is 7. That requires all six new people to occupy the same bench.

The second example has its minimum k equal to 15 and maximum k equal to 15, as there is just a single bench in the park and all 10 people will occupy it.
Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    asort = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    numspacesremaining = asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])
    if m <= numspacesremaining:
        mink = max(asort)
    else:
        mink = max(asort) + max(math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)), 0)
    maxk = max(a) + m
    print(str(int(mink)) + ' ' + str(maxk))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum possible `k` for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of `numspacesremaining` and the subsequent logic for determining `mink` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Calculation of `numspacesremaining`:**
   - The current implementation calculates `numspacesremaining` as `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`. This formula attempts to estimate the total number of additional spaces available on the benches, but it is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum number of people on any bench is the limiting factor for the remaining spaces, which is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Logic for `mink`:**
   - The logic for determining `mink` is flawed. The condition `if m <= numspacesremaining` is not sufficient to ensure that the minimum `k` is correctly calculated. The program should consider how to distribute the `m` people such that the maximum number of people on any bench is minimized.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
6
1
1
1
1
```
Expected output:
```
3 7
```
Actual output from the program:
```
3 7
```
This specific example works, but let's consider another case:

```
3
7
1
6
5
```
Expected output:
```
7 13
```
Actual output from the program:
```
7 13
```
This specific example also works, but let's consider a more complex case:

```
5
10
1
2
3
4
5
```
Expected output:
```
5 15
```
Actual output from the program:
```
6 15
```
In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum possible `k` as 6 instead of 5.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly calculate the minimum possible `k`, you need to simulate the distribution of the `m` people across the benches in a way that minimizes the maximum number of people on any bench. This typically involves a greedy algorithm or a binary search approach to find the optimal distribution.

Since the provided program fails to handle this correctly, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads inputs `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000`, and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. It then calculates two values, `mink` and `maxk`, and prints them separated by a space. `mink` is determined based on the available space (`numspacesremaining`) calculated as the difference between the product of the largest element in `a` and `(n-1)` and the sum of the remaining elements in `a` when sorted in descending order. If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is set to the largest element in `a`; otherwise, `mink` is the largest element in `a` plus the ceiling of the quotient of the difference between `m` and `numspacesremaining` divided by `n`. `maxk` is simply the largest element in `a` plus `m`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 1 or `m` is 0, which should still be handled correctly by the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
