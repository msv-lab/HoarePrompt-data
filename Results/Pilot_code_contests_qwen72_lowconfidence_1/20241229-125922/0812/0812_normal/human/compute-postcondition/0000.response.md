The value of `n` is updated to the integer value read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The values of `m` and the list of integers `a_i` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000, and a list of integers `a_i` of length n where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
