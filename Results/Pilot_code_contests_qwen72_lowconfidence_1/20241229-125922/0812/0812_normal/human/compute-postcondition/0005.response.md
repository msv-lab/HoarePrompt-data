To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000).
   - `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100) and all other elements set to 0.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 1) is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be 1 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100) and all other elements set to 0, `i` is 1**
