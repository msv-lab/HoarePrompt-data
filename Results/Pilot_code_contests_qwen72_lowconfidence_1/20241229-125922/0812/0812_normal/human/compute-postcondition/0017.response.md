The code snippet `maxk = max(a) + m` impacts the program by calculating a new value for `maxk`. The maximum value in the list `a` is determined and then `m` is added to this maximum value to compute `maxk`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000)
- `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100)
- `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order
- `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`
- If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is `asort[0]`. Otherwise, `mink` is `max(asort[0], math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)))`

After executing the code snippet:
- `maxk` is assigned the value of the maximum element in `a` plus `m`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100), `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`, if `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is `asort[0]`; otherwise, `mink` is `max(asort[0], math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)))`, `maxk` is `max(a) + m`**
