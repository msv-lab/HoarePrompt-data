The value of `m` is updated to the integer read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the list `a_i` also remains unchanged. Since the new value of `m` is read from the standard input, it now holds a specific integer value between 1 and 10,000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), and a list of integers `a_i` of length n where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
