The code snippet sorts the list `a` in descending order and assigns the sorted list to `asort`. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000)
- `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100)
- `asort` is now a sorted version of `a` in descending order

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100), `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order.**
