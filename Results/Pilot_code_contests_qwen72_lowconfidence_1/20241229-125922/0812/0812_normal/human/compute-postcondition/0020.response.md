Functionality: ** The function reads inputs `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000`, and each `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. It then calculates two values, `mink` and `maxk`, and prints them separated by a space. `mink` is determined based on the available space (`numspacesremaining`) calculated as the difference between the product of the largest element in `a` and `(n-1)` and the sum of the remaining elements in `a` when sorted in descending order. If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is set to the largest element in `a`; otherwise, `mink` is the largest element in `a` plus the ceiling of the quotient of the difference between `m` and `numspacesremaining` divided by `n`. `maxk` is simply the largest element in `a` plus `m`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 1 or `m` is 0, which should still be handled correctly by the function. **
