Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).**
