The value of `a[i]` is updated to the integer read from the standard input, where `i` is 2. This means `a[2]` is now set to an integer value between 1 and 100. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100), `a[1]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[1] ≤ 100), `a[2]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[2] ≤ 100), and all other elements set to 0, `i` is 2**
