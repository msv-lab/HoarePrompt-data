The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, this operation updates `a[1]` to a new value read from the standard input.

- `a[1]` is now assigned the value of the integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[1] ≤ 100).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 1.
- `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000).
- `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100), `a[1]` is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[1] ≤ 100), and all other elements set to 0.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100), `a[1]` is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[1] ≤ 100), and all other elements set to 0, `i` is 1.**
