The provided Python code snippet prints the values of `mink` and `maxk` as strings concatenated with a space in between. The values of `mink` and `maxk` are calculated based on the initial conditions and the logic provided in the code. Let's break down the impact of the code on the program:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
   - `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000)
   - `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100)
   - `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order
   - `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`
   - If `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is `asort[0]`; otherwise, `mink` is `max(asort[0], math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)))`
   - `maxk` is `max(a) + m`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code prints the values of `mink` and `maxk` as strings concatenated with a space in between.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The values of `mink` and `maxk` are used in the print statement but are not modified.
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `asort`, and `numspacesremaining` remain unchanged.

4. **Output State:**
   - The values of `mink` and `maxk` are printed, but the variables themselves are not modified.
   - The initial conditions remain valid, and no new variables are introduced.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100), `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`, if `m` is less than or equal to `numspacesremaining`, `mink` is `asort[0]`; otherwise, `mink` is `max(asort[0], math.ceil((m - numspacesremaining) / float(n)))`, `maxk` is `max(a) + m`**.
