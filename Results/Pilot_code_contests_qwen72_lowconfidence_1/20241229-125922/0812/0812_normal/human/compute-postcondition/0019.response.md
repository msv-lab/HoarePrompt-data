The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of integers. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000, and the list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Since the specific output logic is not provided, I will assume a general form of output based on common programming tasks involving such parameters. For example, the function might perform some operation using `n`, `m`, and the list `a`.

However, without more specific details about the output, the best description of the functionality is:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of integers. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
