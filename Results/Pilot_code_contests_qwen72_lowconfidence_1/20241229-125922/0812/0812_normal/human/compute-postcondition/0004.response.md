The code snippet `a[i] = int(sys.stdin.readline())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the first element of the list `a` (since `i` is 0). This impacts the value of `a[0]`, which was initially 0, and updates it to the integer read from the input.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000).
- `a_i` is a list of integers of length n where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of length `n` initialized with all elements set to 0.
- `i` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `a[0]` is now set to the integer read from the standard input, which must satisfy 1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100.
- All other elements in the list `a` remain 0.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length n where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` with `a[0]` set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[0] ≤ 100) and all other elements set to 0, `i` is 0**.
