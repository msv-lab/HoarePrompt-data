Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10,000), `a_i` is a list of integers of length `n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` (0 ≤ i < n) is set to an integer read from the standard input (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100), `asort` is a list of length `n` containing the elements of `a` sorted in descending order, `numspacesremaining` is `asort[0] * (n - 1) - sum(asort[1:])`, and `m` is greater than `numspacesremaining`***
