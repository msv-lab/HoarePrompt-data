The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a song and a list of integers representing the notes of the song. It then calculates the number of distinct sequences of consecutive identical notes in the song, where a sequence is considered distinct if it contains more than one note or if it is the last sequence in the song. After calculating this value, it calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value as its argument. The function does not return any value directly but influences the state by calling `func_2` with the computed results. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the song length is 1 or when all notes are the same, which would result in `sol` being 1. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect lengths), the behavior is undefined.
