Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` for updating `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` does not always produce the correct result for maximizing the diversity of the song. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
- The correct way to maximize diversity is to transform the sequence to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` by increasing the second and fourth elements.
- However, the program does not correctly account for this transformation and outputs `3` instead of `4`.

This indicates that the logic for updating the diversity is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
