You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will present it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is rather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. 

His song consists of n notes, which we will treat as positive integers. The diversity of a song is the number of different notes it contains. As a patron of music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the process of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing his song to make it more diverse.

Being a minor goddess, she cannot arbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the n notes in the song, she can either leave it as it is or increase it by 1.

Given the song as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal, achievable diversity.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow, each one is described in two lines.

In the first line of each test case there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the length of the song. The next line contains a sequence of n integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ … ≤ x_n ≤ 2 ⋅ n), describing the song.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, you should output a single line containing precisely one integer, the maximal diversity of the song, i.e. the maximal possible number of different elements in the final sequence.

Example

Input


5
6
1 2 2 2 5 6
2
4 4
6
1 1 3 4 4 5
1
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2


Output


5
2
6
1
3

Note

In the first test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{3}, 2, 2, \underline{6}, \underline{7}, which has 5 different elements (increased elements are underlined).

In the second test case, Euterpe can increase the first element to obtain the sequence \underline{5}, 4, which has 2 different elements.

In the third test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{2}, 3, 4, \underline{5}, \underline{6}, which has 6 different elements.

        file.write(str(x))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` for calculating the maximum diversity is flawed. The issue lies in how the program handles consecutive duplicates and the decision to increment the previous note value. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- According to the problem, for the input `1 1 1 1`, the maximum diversity can be achieved by increasing some of the notes. For example, the sequence can be transformed to `1 2 3 4`, which has a diversity of 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1.

The logic in the program does not properly account for the possibility of increasing consecutive duplicates to achieve higher diversity. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a song and a list of integers representing the notes of the song. It then calculates the number of distinct sequences of consecutive identical notes in the song, where a sequence is considered distinct if it contains more than one note or if it is the last sequence in the song. After calculating this value, it calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value as its argument. The function does not return any value directly but influences the state by calling `func_2` with the computed results. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the song length is 1 or when all notes are the same, which would result in `sol` being 1. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect lengths), the behavior is undefined.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any values, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args when printed, 'file' is a stream object where the values are written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.

If `args` is not empty, the string representations of all elements in `args` have been written to `file`, separated by `sep`. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the key `'end'` if it was present, `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `' '`, `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if `'file'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout` and contains the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` appended, `at_start` is False. If `'flush'` was `True` in `kwargs`, the buffer of `file` is flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the values provided in `*args` to a specified stream (`file`), or to `sys.stdout` by default. The values are separated by a string `sep`, which defaults to a single space. After printing all values, the function appends a string `end`, which defaults to a newline character (`\n`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the stream is flushed to ensure immediate output. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the stream except the `end` string. The final state of the program includes `args` remaining unchanged, `kwargs` potentially modified, and the stream containing the printed values followed by the `end` string. If flushing is enabled, the stream's buffer is also cleared.
