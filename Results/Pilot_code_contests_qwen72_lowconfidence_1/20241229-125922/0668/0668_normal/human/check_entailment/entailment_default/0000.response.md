Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the maximal diversity of a song by either leaving each note as it is or increasing it by 1. However, the current implementation does not correctly achieve this goal. Specifically, the logic used to increment the `sol` variable does not properly account for the possibility of increasing notes to create new distinct notes. The code only increments `sol` when a sequence of identical notes is found or when the sequence is the last in the song, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the number of different notes.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 1 1 2
```
The correct output should be 3, as Euterpe can increase the first three notes to 2, resulting in the sequence 2, 2, 2, 2, and then increase the last note to 3, resulting in the sequence 2, 2, 2, 3. This sequence has 3 different notes (2 and 3).

However, the current implementation would output 2, which is incorrect. This is because the logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where increasing a note can create a new distinct note that was not present in the original sequence.

Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
