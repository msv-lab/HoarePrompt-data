Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` for calculating the maximum diversity is flawed. The issue lies in how the program handles consecutive duplicates and the decision to increment the previous note value. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4
1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- According to the problem, for the input `1 1 1 1`, the maximum diversity can be achieved by increasing some of the notes. For example, the sequence can be transformed to `1 2 3 4`, which has a diversity of 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1.

The logic in the program does not properly account for the possibility of increasing consecutive duplicates to achieve higher diversity. This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
