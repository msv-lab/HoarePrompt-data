You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will present it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is rather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. 

His song consists of n notes, which we will treat as positive integers. The diversity of a song is the number of different notes it contains. As a patron of music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the process of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing his song to make it more diverse.

Being a minor goddess, she cannot arbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the n notes in the song, she can either leave it as it is or increase it by 1.

Given the song as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal, achievable diversity.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow, each one is described in two lines.

In the first line of each test case there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the length of the song. The next line contains a sequence of n integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ … ≤ x_n ≤ 2 ⋅ n), describing the song.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, you should output a single line containing precisely one integer, the maximal diversity of the song, i.e. the maximal possible number of different elements in the final sequence.

Example

Input


5
6
1 2 2 2 5 6
2
4 4
6
1 1 3 4 4 5
1
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2


Output


5
2
6
1
3

Note

In the first test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{3}, 2, 2, \underline{6}, \underline{7}, which has 5 different elements (increased elements are underlined).

In the second test case, Euterpe can increase the first element to obtain the sequence \underline{5}, 4, which has 2 different elements.

In the third test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{2}, 3, 4, \underline{5}, \underline{6}, which has 6 different elements.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
import os
import sys
from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        x = [int(xi) for xi in input().split()]
        prev = 0
        cnt = 0
        sol = 0
        for i in x:
            if i != prev and cnt > 1:
                prev += 1
                sol += 1
            if i == prev:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                prev = i
                sol += 1
                cnt = 1
        if cnt > 1:
            sol += 1
        func_2(sol)

#Function 2:
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
