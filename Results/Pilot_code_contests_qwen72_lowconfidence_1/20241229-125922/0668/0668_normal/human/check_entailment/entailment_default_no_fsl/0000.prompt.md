You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will present it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is rather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. 

His song consists of n notes, which we will treat as positive integers. The diversity of a song is the number of different notes it contains. As a patron of music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the process of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing his song to make it more diverse.

Being a minor goddess, she cannot arbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the n notes in the song, she can either leave it as it is or increase it by 1.

Given the song as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal, achievable diversity.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow, each one is described in two lines.

In the first line of each test case there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the length of the song. The next line contains a sequence of n integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ … ≤ x_n ≤ 2 ⋅ n), describing the song.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, you should output a single line containing precisely one integer, the maximal diversity of the song, i.e. the maximal possible number of different elements in the final sequence.

Example

Input

1 1 1 2 2 2


Output

1
3

Note

In the first test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{3}, 2, 2, \underline{6}, \underline{7}, which has 5 different elements (increased elements are underlined).

In the second test case, Euterpe can increase the first element to obtain the sequence \underline{5}, 4, which has 2 different elements.

In the third test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{2}, 3, 4, \underline{5}, \underline{6}, which has 6 different elements.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a song and a list of integers representing the notes of the song. It then calculates the number of distinct sequences of consecutive identical notes in the song, where a sequence is considered distinct if it contains more than one note or if it is the last sequence in the song. After calculating this value, it calls another function `func_2` with the calculated value as its argument. The function does not return any value directly but influences the state by calling `func_2` with the computed results. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the song length is 1 or when all notes are the same, which would result in `sol` being 1. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect lengths), the behavior is undefined.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` prints the values provided in `*args` to a specified stream (`file`), or to `sys.stdout` by default. The values are separated by a string `sep`, which defaults to a single space. After printing all values, the function appends a string `end`, which defaults to a newline character (`\n`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the stream is flushed to ensure immediate output. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the stream except the `end` string. The final state of the program includes `args` remaining unchanged, `kwargs` potentially modified, and the stream containing the printed values followed by the `end` string. If flushing is enabled, the stream's buffer is also cleared.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
