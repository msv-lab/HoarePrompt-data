Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the issue lies in how the code processes the notes to maximize diversity. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code fails:

### Problem with the Logic
The problem requires maximizing the number of distinct notes by either leaving each note as it is or increasing it by 1. The key insight is that for each note, if we can create a new unique value by increasing it, we should do so to maximize the diversity.

However, the current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle this logic. It incorrectly increments the previous note and counts the number of distinct sequences of consecutive identical notes, which does not align with the problem's requirement.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
6
1 1 1 2 2 2

Expected Output:
3
```

The expected output is 3 because we can transform the sequence to `1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4`, which has 4 distinct notes. However, the current code will output 3, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that each note is either left as is or incremented by 1 to maximize the number of distinct notes. A correct approach would involve using a set to keep track of the distinct notes and iterating through the sequence to decide whether to increment a note or not.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        x = [int(xi) for xi in input().split()]
        seen = set()
        for i in x:
            if i not in seen:
                seen.add(i)
            elif i + 1 not in seen:
                seen.add(i + 1)
        func_2(len(seen))

def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each note, we either add it to the set of seen notes or add the incremented note if it is not already in the set, thus maximizing the diversity of the song.

### Conclusion
The original code does not correctly handle the problem's requirements and fails to produce the correct output for certain cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
