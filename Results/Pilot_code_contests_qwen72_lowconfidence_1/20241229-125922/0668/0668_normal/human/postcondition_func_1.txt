The function `func_2` prints the values provided in `*args` to a specified stream (`file`), or to `sys.stdout` by default. The values are separated by a string `sep`, which defaults to a single space. After printing all values, the function appends a string `end`, which defaults to a newline character (`\n`). If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the stream is flushed to ensure immediate output. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the stream except the `end` string. The final state of the program includes `args` remaining unchanged, `kwargs` potentially modified, and the stream containing the printed values followed by the `end` string. If flushing is enabled, the stream's buffer is also cleared.
