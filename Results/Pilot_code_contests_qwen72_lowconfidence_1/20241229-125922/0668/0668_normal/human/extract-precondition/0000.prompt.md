You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will present it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is rather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. 

His song consists of n notes, which we will treat as positive integers. The diversity of a song is the number of different notes it contains. As a patron of music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the process of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing his song to make it more diverse.

Being a minor goddess, she cannot arbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the n notes in the song, she can either leave it as it is or increase it by 1.

Given the song as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal, achievable diversity.

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow, each one is described in two lines.

In the first line of each test case there is a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) denoting the length of the song. The next line contains a sequence of n integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ … ≤ x_n ≤ 2 ⋅ n), describing the song.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, you should output a single line containing precisely one integer, the maximal diversity of the song, i.e. the maximal possible number of different elements in the final sequence.

Example

1 1 1 2 2 2


Output

Note

In the first test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{3}, 2, 2, \underline{6}, \underline{7}, which has 5 different elements (increased elements are underlined).

In the second test case, Euterpe can increase the first element to obtain the sequence \underline{5}, 4, which has 2 different elements.

In the third test case, Euterpe can increase the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence 1, \underline{2}, 3, 4, \underline{5}, \underline{6}, which has 6 different elements.
Program:
```

    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)

        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
