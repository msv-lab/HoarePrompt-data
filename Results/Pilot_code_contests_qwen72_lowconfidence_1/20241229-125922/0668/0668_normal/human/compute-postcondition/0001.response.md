The code assigns the value of `kwargs['sep']` to `sep` if 'sep' is a key in `kwargs`, otherwise it assigns the default value ' '. Similarly, it assigns the value of `kwargs['file']` to `file` if 'file' is a key in `kwargs`, otherwise it assigns the default value `sys.stdout`. The `pop` method also removes these keys from the `kwargs` dictionary.

Therefore, the Output State is: **args is a tuple of any values, kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush'. 'sep' is the string from `kwargs` if 'sep' was in `kwargs`, otherwise ' ', and 'file' is the stream object from `kwargs` if 'file' was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout`.**
