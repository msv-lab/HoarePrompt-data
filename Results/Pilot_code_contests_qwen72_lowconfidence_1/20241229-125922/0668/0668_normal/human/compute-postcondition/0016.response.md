Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple that must contain at least three elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if 'sep' was in `kwargs`, otherwise ' ', `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if 'file' was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the third element of `args`. If `at_start` is False, `file` now contains the written `sep` value.***
