The code snippet provided sets the variable `cnt` to 1. This directly changes the value of `cnt` from its initial state (which could have been 1 or greater, depending on the conditions described in the initial state) to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the third element of `x`, `cnt` is 1, `sol` is incremented to 6 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 2.**
