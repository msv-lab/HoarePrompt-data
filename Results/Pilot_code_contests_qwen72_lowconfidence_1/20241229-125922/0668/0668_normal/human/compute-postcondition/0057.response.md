The code snippet `sol += 1` increments the value of `sol` by 1. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Since `sol` was previously stated to remain unchanged, it now changes by incrementing by 1. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`, `prev` is the first element in the list `x`, `cnt` is greater than 1, `sol` is incremented by 1.**
