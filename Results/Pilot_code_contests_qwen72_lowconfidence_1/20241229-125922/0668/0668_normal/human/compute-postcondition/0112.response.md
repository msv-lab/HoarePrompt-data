The provided code snippet increments the variable `sol` by 1. This operation affects only the `sol` variable, while the rest of the variables remain unchanged according to their initial state. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements.
- The loop variable `_` is 1.
- `i` is the third element in the list `x`.
- `prev` is `prev + 1`.
- If `i` is equal to `prev - 1`, then `cnt` is 1.
- Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev - 1` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.

After executing the code snippet `sol += 1`, the updated state is:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements.
- The loop variable `_` is 1.
- `i` is the third element in the list `x`.
- `prev` is `prev + 1`.
- If `i` is equal to `prev - 1`, then `cnt` is 1.
- Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev - 1` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.
- `sol` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is `prev + 1`, if `i` is equal to `prev - 1`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev - 1` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`, `sol` is incremented by 1.**
