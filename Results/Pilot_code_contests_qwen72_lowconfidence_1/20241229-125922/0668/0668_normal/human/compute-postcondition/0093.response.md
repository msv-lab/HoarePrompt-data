Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 0, the loop variable `_` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to 1, `cnt` is reset to 0, `sol` is incremented by 1, and the loop variable `_` remains 1.***
