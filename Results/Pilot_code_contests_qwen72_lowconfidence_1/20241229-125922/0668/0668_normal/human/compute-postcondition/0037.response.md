Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is empty, `prev` remains 0, `cnt` remains 0, and `sol` remains 0. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique integer in the sequence of `x` that had a count greater than 1, or the last element of `x` if no such sequence exists. `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive integers that ended in the last element of `x`. `sol` is the number of unique sequences of consecutive integers in `x` where each sequence has a count greater than 1, plus the number of unique integers in `x` that do not form such sequences.**
