The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `i`, `cnt`, and `prev`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the first element of `x` plus 1, `cnt` is 1 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, `sol` is incremented to 5 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 2.**
