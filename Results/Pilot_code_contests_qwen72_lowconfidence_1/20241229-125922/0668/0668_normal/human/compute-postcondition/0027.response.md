Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements. If `i` (the second element of `x`) is equal to `prev` (the first element of `x`), `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, `prev` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is reset to 1, and `sol` is incremented to 3. Otherwise, `prev` is set to the second element of `x`, `cnt` is set to 1, and `sol` is incremented to 4 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 1.***
