The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`. If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, `prev` is updated to the second element in the list `x` plus 1, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`, and `sol` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `prev` remains the second element in the list `x`, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`, and `sol` remains unchanged.**
