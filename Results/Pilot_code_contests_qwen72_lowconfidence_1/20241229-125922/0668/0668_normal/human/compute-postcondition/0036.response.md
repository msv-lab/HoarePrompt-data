Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the first element of `x`. If `i` is equal to `prev`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `sol` is incremented to 5 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 1. If `i` is not equal to `prev`, `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, and `sol` is incremented to 6 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 2.***
