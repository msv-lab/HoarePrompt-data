The function `func_2(sol)` is called, which suggests that this function might modify or use the value of `sol`. However, without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine exactly what changes occur. Assuming `func_2` does not return a value and does not modify any global variables, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique value in the list `x` that was not consecutive with the previous value. If `cnt` is greater than 1, `sol` is the total number of unique sequences of consecutive values in the list `x` plus 1. If `cnt` is 1 or `x` is empty, `cnt` is 0, `prev` is 0, and `sol` is 0.**
