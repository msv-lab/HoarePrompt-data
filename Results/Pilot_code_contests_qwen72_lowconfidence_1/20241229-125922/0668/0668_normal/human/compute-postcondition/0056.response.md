The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the first element in the list `x`, and since `i` is not equal to the previous value of `prev`, this assignment changes the value of `prev` to match the first element in `x`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is the first element in the list `x`.
- `i` is not equal to `prev` (now `prev` is equal to `i`).
- `cnt` is greater than 1.
- The values of `cnt` and `sol` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`, `prev` is the first element in the list `x`, `cnt` is greater than 1, and the values of `cnt` and `sol` remain unchanged.**
