Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`. If `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.***
