The value of `sol` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`, `prev` is `prev + 1`, `cnt` is as per initial conditions, `sol` is `sol + 1`.**
