The code snippet `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the stream object `file`. This operation does not change the values of the variables `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, `at_start`, or `x`. However, it performs an action on the stream object `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple that must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if 'sep' was in `kwargs`, otherwise ' ', `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if 'file' was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the first element of `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
