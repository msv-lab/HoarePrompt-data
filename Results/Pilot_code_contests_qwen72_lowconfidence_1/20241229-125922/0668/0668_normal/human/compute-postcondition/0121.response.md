The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `sol` is the original value of `sol` plus 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is empty, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `sol` is 1. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique integer in the sequence, `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique integer in the sequence, and `sol` is the number of unique integers in the sequence plus the number of times a unique integer appears more than once consecutively plus 1. Additionally, the current value of `cnt` is greater than 1.**
