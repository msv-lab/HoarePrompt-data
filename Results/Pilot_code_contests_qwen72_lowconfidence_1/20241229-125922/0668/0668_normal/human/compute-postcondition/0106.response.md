The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements.
- The loop variable `_` is 1.
- `i` is the second element in the list `x`.
- If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1.

After executing `prev = i`, the variable `prev` now holds the value of `i`, which is the second element in the list `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`, `prev` is the second element in the list `x`.**
