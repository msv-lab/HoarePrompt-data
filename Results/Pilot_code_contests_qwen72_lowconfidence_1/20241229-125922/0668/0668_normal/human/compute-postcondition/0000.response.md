The provided code snippet is a comment that describes the functionality of a print function but does not actually execute any operations. Therefore, the variables `args` and `kwargs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any values, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values in args when printed, 'file' is a stream object where the values are written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.**
