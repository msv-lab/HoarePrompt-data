To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements.
- The loop variable `_` is 1.
- `i` is the second element in the list `x`.
- If `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1.
- Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in x:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `x`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `x` has at least two elements.
   - `i` is the second element in the list `x`.
   - `_` is 1 (this variable is not used in the loop condition, so it doesn't affect the loop execution).

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must have at least three elements.
   - The loop variable `i` will be the third element in the list `x` in the next iteration.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be the third element in the list `x`.
   - The conditions involving `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` will depend on the value of the third element in the list `x`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` remains an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` must have at least three elements.
- The loop variable `_` is still 1 (not used in the loop condition).
- `i` is the third element in the list `x`.
- The values of `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` will be updated based on the third element in the list `x`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`. If `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.**
