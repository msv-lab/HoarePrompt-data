The code snippet `cnt = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. Since `cnt` was already initialized to 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1.**
