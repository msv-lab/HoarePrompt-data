The code snippet `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to the current value of `i`. Based on the initial state, `i` is the third element in the list `x`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `i` is the third element in the list `x`
- `prev` is now equal to the third element in the list `x`
- `cnt` remains unchanged
- `sol` remains unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is the third element in the list `x`, `cnt` is unchanged, `sol` is unchanged.**
