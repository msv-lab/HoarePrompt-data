Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the key `'end'` if it was present, `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `' '`, `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if `'file'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout` and contains the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` appended, `at_start` is False. If `'flush'` was `True` in `kwargs`, the buffer of `file` is flushed.***
