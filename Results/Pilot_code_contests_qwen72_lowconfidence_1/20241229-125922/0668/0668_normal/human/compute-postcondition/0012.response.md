The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` (which is the second element of `args`) to the stream object `file`. The state of `file` and `x` remains unchanged except for the content written to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple that must contain at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain the keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if 'sep' was in `kwargs`, otherwise ' ', `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if 'file' was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `x` is the second element of `args`. The string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
