The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `_`, `i`, `prev`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is the second element in the list `x` plus 1, `cnt` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the conditions, `sol` is `sol + 1`.**
