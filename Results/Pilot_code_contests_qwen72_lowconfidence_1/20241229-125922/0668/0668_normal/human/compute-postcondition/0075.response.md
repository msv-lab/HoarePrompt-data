The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10,000, `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^5, `x` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is the third element in the list `x`, and `cnt` is unchanged, these conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is the third element in the list `x`, `cnt` is unchanged, `sol` is incremented by 1.**
