To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop:

- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `prev` is 0.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `sol` is 0.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

The for loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `x`. For the loop to execute, the list `x` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `prev`, `cnt`, `sol`, `_`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but they should be noted as part of the initial state.

Given this, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop executes are:

- `x` must have at least one element.
- `i` is the first element in the list `x`.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`**
