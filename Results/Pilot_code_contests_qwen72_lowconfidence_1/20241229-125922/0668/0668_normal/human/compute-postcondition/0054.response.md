The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `_`, `i`, `prev`, and `sol` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`, `i` is equal to `prev`, `cnt` is greater than 2, and the values of `prev` and `sol` remain unchanged.**
