The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements.
- The loop variable `_` is 1.
- `i` is the second element in the list `x`.
- If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`.
- Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1.

After executing the code snippet `cnt += 1`:
- `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is updated to `i`, `cnt` is reset to 1, `sol` is incremented by 1, and `prev` is `prev + 1`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `prev`, then `cnt` is 1.**
