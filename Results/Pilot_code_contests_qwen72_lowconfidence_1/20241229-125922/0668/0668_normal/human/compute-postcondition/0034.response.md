The code snippet `sol += 1` increments the value of `sol` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `sol` is incremented to 5 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 1, this means that before this snippet, `sol` had already been incremented by 1 or 5 based on the conditions. Now, `sol` is further incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the third element of `x`, `cnt` is 1 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, `sol` is incremented to 6 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 2.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the third element of `x`, `cnt` is 1 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, `sol` is incremented to 6 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 2.**
