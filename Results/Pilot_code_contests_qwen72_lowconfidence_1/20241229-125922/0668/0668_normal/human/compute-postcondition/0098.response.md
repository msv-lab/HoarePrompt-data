The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `prev` is `i`, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 1, the loop variable `_` is 1. `i` is not equal to `prev`.**
