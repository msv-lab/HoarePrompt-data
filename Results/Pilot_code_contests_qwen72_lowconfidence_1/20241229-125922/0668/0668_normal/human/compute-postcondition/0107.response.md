The value of `sol` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `i` and `prev` are both the second element in the list `x`, and no changes to these variables are made by the code, they retain their values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`, `prev` is the second element in the list `x`, `sol` is incremented by 1**
