The code `prev = i` updates the variable `prev` to the current value of `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is the third element of the list `x`, and `prev` was initially the first element of `x`.

After executing the code, the new value of `prev` is now the third element of `x`, which is `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `cnt`, and `sol`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `x`, `prev` is the third element of `x`, `cnt` is 1 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `sol` is incremented to 5 if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 1.**
