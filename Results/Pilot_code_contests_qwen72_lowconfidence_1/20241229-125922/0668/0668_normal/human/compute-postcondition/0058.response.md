The code snippet `cnt = 1` sets the variable `cnt` to 1, overriding its previous condition where it was stated to be greater than 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`, `prev` is the first element in the list `x`, `cnt` is 1, `sol` is incremented by 1.**
