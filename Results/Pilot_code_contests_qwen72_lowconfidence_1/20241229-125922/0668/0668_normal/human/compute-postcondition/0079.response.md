Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique value in the list `x` that was not consecutive with the previous value, `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive values in the list `x`, and `sol` is the total number of unique sequences of consecutive values in the list `x`. If `x` is empty, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `sol` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `cnt` is greater than 1.***
