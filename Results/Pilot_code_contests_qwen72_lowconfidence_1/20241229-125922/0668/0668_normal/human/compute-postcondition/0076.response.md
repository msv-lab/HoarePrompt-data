The code snippet `cnt = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `cnt`. This changes the value of `cnt` from its previous state to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is the third element in the list `x`, `cnt` is 1, `sol` is incremented by 1.**
