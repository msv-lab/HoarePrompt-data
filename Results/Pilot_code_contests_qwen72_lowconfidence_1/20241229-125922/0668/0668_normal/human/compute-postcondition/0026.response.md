Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least two elements, `prev` is the second element of `x`, `cnt` is 1, `sol` is incremented to 4 if the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x` and `cnt` was greater than 1, otherwise `sol` is incremented to 1.**
