The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters within the provided code snippet. However, based on the context given, it can be inferred that the function is expected to work with the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000.
- `n`: A positive integer representing the length of the song, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `x`: A list of n integers, where 1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ ... ≤ x_n ≤ 2 * n, representing the notes of the song.

Given the constraints and the nature of the parameters, the function is likely designed to process these inputs and produce some form of output based on the analysis of the notes in the song. However, the specific output is not defined in the provided information. 

Since the output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the song; and `x`, a list of n integers representing the notes of the song. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the analysis of the notes in the song for each test case.**
