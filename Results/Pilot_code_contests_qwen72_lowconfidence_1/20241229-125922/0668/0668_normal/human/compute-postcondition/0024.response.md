The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context, it seems to accept `*args` and `**kwargs`. The parameters are as follows:

- `args`: A tuple containing any number of values of any type.
- `kwargs`: A dictionary that can contain the following keys:
  - `'sep'`: A string used to separate the values in `args` when printed.
  - `'file'`: A stream object where the values are written.
  - `'end'`: A string appended after the last value.
  - `'flush'`: A boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.

The function does not return any value explicitly (i.e., it returns `None` by default). Instead, it performs actions based on the provided parameters, such as printing the values to a specified file or stream, using the specified separator and end string, and optionally flushing the stream.

Functionality: **The function accepts `*args` (a tuple of any values) and `**kwargs` (a dictionary that can contain 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' keys). It prints the values in `args` to the specified `file` stream, using `sep` as the separator and `end` as the ending string, and optionally flushes the stream if `flush` is `True`.**
