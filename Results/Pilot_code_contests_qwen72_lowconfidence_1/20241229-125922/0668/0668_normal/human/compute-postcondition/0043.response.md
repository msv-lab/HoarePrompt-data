The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) ensure that the input is within the specified range. The values of `t`, `x`, `prev`, `cnt`, `sol`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is empty, `prev` remains 0, `cnt` remains 0, and `sol` is 1. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique integer in the sequence of `x` that had a count greater than 1, or the last element of `x` if no such sequence exists. `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive integers that ended in the last element of `x`. If `cnt` > 1, `sol` is the number of unique sequences of consecutive integers in `x` where each sequence has a count greater than 1, plus the number of unique integers in `x` that do not form such sequences, plus 1. Otherwise, `sol` is the number of unique sequences of consecutive integers in `x` where each sequence has a count greater than 1, plus the number of unique integers in `x` that do not form such sequences. `_` is incremented by 1.**
