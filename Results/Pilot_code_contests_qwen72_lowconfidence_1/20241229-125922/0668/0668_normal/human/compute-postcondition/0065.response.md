The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is the second element in the list `x`) to the variable `prev`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `_`, `cnt`, or `sol`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `i` is the second element in the list `x`
- `prev` is now equal to the second element in the list `x`
- If the second element in the list `x` is not equal to the previous value of `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `cnt` is set to 0, and `sol` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, if the second element in the list `x` is not equal to the previous value of `prev`, `cnt` is set to 1, and `sol` is incremented by 1.
- If the second element in the list `x` is equal to the previous value of `prev` or `cnt` is not greater than 1, the values of `prev` and `sol` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the second element in the list `x`, `prev` is the second element in the list `x`, `cnt` is unchanged, `sol` is unchanged**
