Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `prev` is 0, if `cnt` is greater than 1, `sol` is the total number of unique sequences of consecutive values in the list `x` plus 1, if `cnt` is 1 or `x` is empty, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 0, the loop variable `_` is 1.**
