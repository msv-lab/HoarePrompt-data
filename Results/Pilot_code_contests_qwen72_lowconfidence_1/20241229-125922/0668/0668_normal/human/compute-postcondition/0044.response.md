The provided code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns this list to the variable `x`.

- The variable `x` was initially described as a list of integers read from the input. This means that before executing the code, `x` was expected to be populated based on user input.
- After executing the code, `x` is now explicitly defined as a list of integers derived from the input split by spaces, converted to integers.

Since the code only affects the variable `x`, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `prev`, `cnt`, `sol`, `_`) remain unchanged. The specific values of these variables (such as `t` being between 1 and 10,000, `n` being between 1 and 10^5, etc.) are still valid as they were not modified by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `prev` remains 0, `cnt` remains 0, `sol` is 1, `_` is incremented by 1.**
