The code snippet sets the variable `sol` to 0. This overrides the initial value of `sol` which was 1. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1.**
