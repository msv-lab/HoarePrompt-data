The `file.flush()` command flushes the internal buffer of the file object, ensuring all buffered data is written to the file (or stream). This operation does not change the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, or `file` itself, but it ensures that any data buffered in `file` is immediately written out.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a tuple of any values
- `kwargs` is a dictionary without the key `'end'` if it was present
- `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `' '`
- `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if `'file'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout` and contains the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` appended
- `at_start` is False
- The current value of `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is `True`

After executing `file.flush()`, the only change is that the buffer of `file` is flushed. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any values, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the key `'end'` if it was present, `sep` is the string from `kwargs` if `'sep'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `' '`, `file` is the stream object from `kwargs` if `'file'` was in `kwargs`, otherwise `sys.stdout` and contains the value of `'end'` or `'\n'` appended, `at_start` is False, the buffer of `file` is flushed.**
