The code snippet `cnt = 1` resets the value of `cnt` to 1, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `cnt` was greater than 1, this update changes the value of `cnt` back to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least three elements, the loop variable `_` is 1, `i` is the third element in the list `x`, `prev` is `x[2]`, `sol` is incremented by 1, `cnt` is 1, `prev` is `prev + 1` if `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, otherwise `cnt` remains 1.**
