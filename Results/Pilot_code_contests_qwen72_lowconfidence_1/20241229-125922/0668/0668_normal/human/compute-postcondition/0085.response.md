The code snippet `x = [int(xi) for xi in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer, storing these integers in the list `x`.

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `x` is now a list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` are not directly affected by this code snippet, so they remain as they were initially described.
- The loop variable `_` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, if `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique value in the list `x` that was not consecutive with the previous value, if `cnt` is greater than 1, `sol` is the total number of unique sequences of consecutive values in the list `x` plus 1, if `cnt` is 1 or `x` is empty, `cnt` is 0, `prev` is 0, and `sol` is 0, the loop variable `_` is 1.**
