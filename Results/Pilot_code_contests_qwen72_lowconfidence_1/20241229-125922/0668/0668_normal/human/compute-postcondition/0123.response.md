To address the given task, let's analyze the impact of the code snippet `func_2(sol)` on the program:

- The function `func_2` is called with the argument `sol`.
- We need to determine what `func_2` does to `sol` and whether it modifies any other variables.

However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. 

Given this, we can only state that the function `func_2` is called with the current value of `sol`, and any changes to `sol` or other variables would depend on the implementation of `func_2`.

Since the initial state provides detailed conditions for `sol`, `prev`, `cnt`, and `x`, and these conditions remain unchanged unless `func_2` explicitly modifies them, the output state will reflect the same conditions unless `func_2` alters them.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `x` is empty, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `sol` is 1 if `cnt` was greater than 1; otherwise, `sol` remains 0. If `x` is not empty, `prev` is the last unique integer in the sequence, `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique integer in the sequence, and `sol` is the number of unique integers in the sequence plus the number of times a unique integer appears more than once consecutively. If `cnt` was greater than 1, `sol` is incremented by 1. `func_2(sol)` has been called.**
