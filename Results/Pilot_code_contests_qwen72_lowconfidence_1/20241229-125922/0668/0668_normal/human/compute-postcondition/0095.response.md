The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `cnt` was 0, after the increment, `cnt` is now 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `sol` is 0, the loop variable `_` is 1, the current value of `i` is equal to `prev`.**
