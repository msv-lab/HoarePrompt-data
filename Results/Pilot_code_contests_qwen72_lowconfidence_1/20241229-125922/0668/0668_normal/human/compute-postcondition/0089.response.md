To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is iterating over the list `x`.
   - For the loop to execute, the list `x` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - `x` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `prev` is 0.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `sol` is 0.
   - The loop variable `_` is 1 (this is not relevant to the loop's execution since the loop uses `i`).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `x` must have at least one element.
   - The initial values of `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` are already set and do not affect the loop's ability to start.
   - The value of `t` and `n` are constraints but do not directly impact the loop's execution.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `x` is not empty.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `prev` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `sol` is 0, the loop variable `_` is 1**.
