Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`. If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is set to 1, `cnt` is set to 0, and `sol` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `prev`, `cnt`, and `sol` remain unchanged.***
