Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in the list `x`. If `i` is equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 2, then the values of `prev` and `sol` remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to `prev` and `cnt` is greater than 1, then `prev` is set to 1, `cnt` is set to 0, and `sol` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `prev`, `prev` is set to the first element in the list `x`, `cnt` is set to 1, and `sol` is incremented by 1.***
