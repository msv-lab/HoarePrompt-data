The input is a series of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the song, followed by a sequence of n integers x_1, x_2, …, x_n (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ … ≤ x_n ≤ 2 ⋅ n) where each x_i represents a note in the song. The total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10,000, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
