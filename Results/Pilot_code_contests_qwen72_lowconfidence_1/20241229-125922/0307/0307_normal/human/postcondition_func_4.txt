`func_5` sets up the environment by increasing the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and setting the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After `func_5` completes, the environment is configured for potentially deep recursion and larger stack usage, and the `main` function is running in a separate thread. If the `main` function raises an exception or does not terminate, the thread will continue to run independently of the main program flow.
