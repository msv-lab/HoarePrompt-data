The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted and a function `getKey` that defines the sorting criteria. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted according to the criteria defined by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function handles all types of elements that can be compared and sorted, including edge cases such as empty lists or lists with identical elements. If `getKey` is not provided or is invalid, the behavior of the function is undefined and may result in errors or unexpected results.
