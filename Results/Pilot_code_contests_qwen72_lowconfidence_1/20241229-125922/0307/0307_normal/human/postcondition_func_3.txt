The function `func_4` takes no parameters and returns a list representing the final state of the multiverse after processing a series of decisions stored in the `decisions` list. Each decision in the `decisions` list is a string in the format "1 i" or "0 i", where "1 i" indicates creating a new segment at position `i` and "0 i" indicates breaking an existing segment at position `i`. The function modifies the length of the multiverse according to these rules and returns the final state. The function assumes that the initial state of the multiverse and the `decisions` list are correctly formatted and within the specified constraints (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). If the `decisions` list contains invalid entries or if the modifications lead to an invalid state (e.g., attempting to break a segment that doesn't exist), the behavior is undefined.
