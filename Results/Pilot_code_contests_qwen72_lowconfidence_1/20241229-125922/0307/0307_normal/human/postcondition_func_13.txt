The function `func_14` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It performs the following checks: 

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For integers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all numbers of the form `6k Â± 1` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1 and where `n` is 2 or 3. It also efficiently checks for primality by only considering potential divisors up to the square root of `n`.
