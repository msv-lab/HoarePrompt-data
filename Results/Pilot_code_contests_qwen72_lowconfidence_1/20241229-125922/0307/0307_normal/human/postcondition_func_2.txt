The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of user input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then parses this input into a list of integers using the `map` function. However, the function does not convert the result of `map` into a tuple or list, so it returns an iterator instead of a tuple. Therefore, the function returns an iterator of integers parsed from the user input. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert the input to integers.
