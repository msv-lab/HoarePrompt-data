The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input provided when the `input()` function is called. The function waits for the user to input a string, which can be any valid input (including empty strings), and then returns that string. If the user provides no input and just presses Enter, the function will return an empty string. The final state of the program is that the user input is returned, and no other changes are made to the program's state.
