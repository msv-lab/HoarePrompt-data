The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including the edge case where `n` is 0, which results in the string "0". If a negative integer is passed, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `bin` function does not accept negative integers.
