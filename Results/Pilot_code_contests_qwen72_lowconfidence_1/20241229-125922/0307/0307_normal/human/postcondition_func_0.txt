The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and returned. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer (if the input was valid) or will have raised an exception (if the input was invalid).
