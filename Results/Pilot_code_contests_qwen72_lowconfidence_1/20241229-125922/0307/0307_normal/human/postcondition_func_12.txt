The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function ensures that the GCD is correctly computed even if one or both of the inputs are zero. Specifically, if `y` is zero, the function returns `x`, and if `x` is zero, the function returns `y`. In all other cases, the function iterates through the Euclidean algorithm until `y` becomes zero, at which point `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
