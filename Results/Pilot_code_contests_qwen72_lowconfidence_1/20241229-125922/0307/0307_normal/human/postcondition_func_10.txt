The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list where each element is a string representation of a digit from the integer `n`. For example, if `n` is 1234, the function returns `['1', '2', '3', '4']`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `['0']`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including zero, and ensures that each digit is converted to a string and included in the resulting list.
