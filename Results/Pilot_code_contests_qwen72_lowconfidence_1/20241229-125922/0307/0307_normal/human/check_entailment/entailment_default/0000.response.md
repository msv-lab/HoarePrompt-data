Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_15` does not correctly handle the case when a link is broken and the segment containing the Doctor is not the remaining segment. Specifically, the logic for updating `n` and `k` when `a` is 0 (indicating a link break) is incorrect. According to the problem description, when a link is broken, the segment NOT containing the Doctor should cease to exist. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Link Break Logic**:
   - When `a` is 0 and `b` is less than `k`, the function updates `n` and `k` by subtracting `b` from both. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the segment containing the Doctor remains.
   - When `a` is 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function sets `n` to `b`. This is also incorrect because it does not correctly reflect the remaining segment containing the Doctor.

2. **Correct Link Break Logic**:
   - If `a` is 0 and `b` is less than `k`, the segment to the left of the link should be removed, and `n` should be updated to the length of the remaining segment, and `k` should remain the same.
   - If `a` is 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, the segment to the right of the link should be removed, and `n` should be updated to the length of the remaining segment, and `k` should be adjusted accordingly.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly handle the link break operations as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
