Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly in all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Breaking Links**:
   - In the `func_15` function, the logic for breaking links is incorrect. Specifically, when a link is broken (`a == 0`), the program attempts to adjust the number of universes and the Doctor's position, but it does so in a way that can lead to incorrect results.
   - For example, when a link is broken at position `b` and `b < k`, the program subtracts `b` from both `n` and `k`. This is incorrect because it should only subtract 1 from `n` and adjust `k` accordingly. Similarly, when `b >= k`, the program subtracts `n - b` from `n`, which is also incorrect.

2. **Potential Off-by-One Errors**:
   - The logic for inserting a new universe (`a == 1`) is mostly correct, but the program should ensure that the insertion position `b` is within valid bounds (1 to `l + 1`), where `l` is the current length of the multiverse. The program does not explicitly check this, although the problem guarantees that the input will be valid.

3. **Output Function**:
   - The `func_16` function is used to print the results, but it uses bytes instead of strings for the separator and end characters. This might cause issues in some environments, especially if the output is expected to be human-readable text.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
5 2 10 4
0 1
1 1
0 4
1 2
```
The expected output is:
```
4 1
5 2
4 2
5 3
```
However, the program will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

For example, after the first operation `0 1`, the program should output `4 1`, but it might output something different due to the incorrect link-breaking logic.
