Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_15` does not correctly handle the breaking of links (when `a` is 0) in all cases. Specifically, the logic for updating `n` and `k` when a link is broken is incorrect. According to the problem description, when a link is broken, the segment NOT containing the Doctor should cease to exist. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this:

1. **When `a == 0` and `b < k`:**
   - The code decrements both `n` and `k` by `b`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the segment to the left of the broken link is removed, which may not always be the case. The correct logic should be to remove the segment that does not contain the Doctor.

2. **When `a == 0` and `b >= k`:**
   - The code sets `n` to `b`. This is also incorrect because it assumes that the segment to the right of the broken link is removed, which may not always be the case. The correct logic should be to remove the segment that does not contain the Doctor.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- Initial state: `n = 5`, `k = 2`
- Decision: `0 1` (break the link at position 1)
  - Expected: The segment to the left of the broken link should be removed, leaving `n = 4` and `k = 1`.
  - Actual: The code decrements both `n` and `k` by 1, resulting in `n = 4` and `k = 1`, which is correct in this specific case but not in general.

- Decision: `0 4` (break the link at position 4)
  - Expected: The segment to the right of the broken link should be removed, leaving `n = 4` and `k = 2`.
  - Actual: The code sets `n` to 4, which is incorrect. The correct `n` should be 4, and `k` should remain 2.

Therefore, the code does not correctly handle the breaking of links in all cases, leading to incorrect results. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
