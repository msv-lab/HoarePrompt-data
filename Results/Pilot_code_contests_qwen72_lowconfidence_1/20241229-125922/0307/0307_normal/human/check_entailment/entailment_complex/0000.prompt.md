You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel universes is "like travelling sideways". However, he incorrectly thought that there were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know, there will never be more than 250.

Heidi recently got her hands on a multiverse observation tool. She was able to see all n universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k-th universe.

The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m.

Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken.

More specifically, 

  * When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. 
  * When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. 



Heidi wants to perform a simulation of t decisions. Each time a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse (i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, m and t (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each of the following t lines is in one of the following formats: 

  * "1 i" — meaning that a universe is inserted at the position i (1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 
  * "0 i" — meaning that the i-th link is broken (1 ≤ i ≤ l - 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 

Output

Output t lines. Each line should contain l, the current length of the multiverse and k, the current position of the Doctor.

It is guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the multiverse will have length at most m and when the link breaking is performed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse.

Example

Input


5 2 10 4
0 1
1 1
0 4
1 2


Output


4 1
5 2
4 2
5 3

Note

The multiverse initially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second.

First, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the Doctor in the first.

Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the multiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in the second universe.

Then, the rightmost link was broken.

Finally, a universe was added between the first and the second universe.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and returned. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer (if the input was valid) or will have raised an exception (if the input was invalid).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the function signature are used, as the function `func_2` does not take any parameters and simply returns the result of the `input()` function.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the user input provided when the `input()` function is called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input provided when the `input()` function is called. The function waits for the user to input a string, which can be any valid input (including empty strings), and then returns that string. If the user provides no input and just presses Enter, the function will return an empty string. The final state of the program is that the user input is returned, and no other changes are made to the program's state.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and returns a tuple of integers parsed from a single line of user input. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a tuple of integers parsed from a single line of user input, where the input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of user input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then parses this input into a list of integers using the `map` function. However, the function does not convert the result of `map` into a tuple or list, so it returns an iterator instead of a tuple. Therefore, the function returns an iterator of integers parsed from the user input. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert the input to integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, m, and t are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. decisions is a list of t strings, each in the format "1 i" or "0 i" where 1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1 for creation and 1 ≤ i ≤ l - 1 for breaking, and l is the current length of the multiverse.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list that represents the final state of the multiverse after processing the `decisions` list, where each decision modifies the length of the multiverse according to the rules provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes no parameters and returns a list representing the final state of the multiverse after processing a series of decisions stored in the `decisions` list. Each decision in the `decisions` list is a string in the format "1 i" or "0 i", where "1 i" indicates creating a new segment at position `i` and "0 i" indicates breaking an existing segment at position `i`. The function modifies the length of the multiverse according to these rules and returns the final state. The function assumes that the initial state of the multiverse and the `decisions` list are correctly formatted and within the specified constraints (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). If the `decisions` list contains invalid entries or if the modifications lead to an invalid state (e.g., attempting to break a segment that doesn't exist), the behavior is undefined.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters, and its purpose is to set up the environment for the main function by adjusting the recursion limit and stack size, which are relevant to the execution context rather than the problem's input or output.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_5` sets up the environment by increasing the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and setting the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After `func_5` completes, the environment is configured for potentially deep recursion and larger stack usage, and the `main` function is running in a separate thread. If the `main` function raises an exception or does not terminate, the thread will continue to run independently of the main program flow.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a list or tuple with at least one element.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the list or tuple 'item'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple with at least one element. It returns the first element of `item`. If `item` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the first element of `item` is returned, and no modifications are made to `item` itself.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements that can be compared and sorted, and getKey is a function that defines the sorting criteria.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a sorted list of elements from `l` based on the criteria defined by the `getKey` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted and a function `getKey` that defines the sorting criteria. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted according to the criteria defined by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function handles all types of elements that can be compared and sorted, including edge cases such as empty lists or lists with identical elements. If `getKey` is not provided or is invalid, the behavior of the function is undefined and may result in errors or unexpected results.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, and num is an integer.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list consisting of `n` sublists, each containing `m` occurrences of the integer `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 250\), and `num` is an integer. It returns a 2D list consisting of `n` sublists, each containing `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function correctly handles the specified range for `n` and `m` and ensures that the returned list meets the described structure. No additional edge cases or missing functionality are observed in the provided code.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns False if x is 0, otherwise it returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x` and returns `False` if `x` is 0. If `x` is not 0, the function returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, and `False` otherwise. This means the function effectively checks if `x` is a power of two or zero.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, where `n` is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including the edge case where `n` is 0, which results in the string "0". If a negative integer is passed, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `bin` function does not accept negative integers.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return [i for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing each digit of the non-negative integer `n` as strings.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list where each element is a string representation of a digit from the integer `n`. For example, if `n` is 1234, the function returns `['1', '2', '3', '4']`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `['0']`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including zero, and ensures that each digit is converted to a string and included in the resulting list.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, p is a positive integer.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial `x` and taking modulo `p` for each bit position of the original `y`, `res` is `x` raised to the power of the original `y` modulo `p`, `p` is a positive integer.
    return res
    #The program returns `res` which is the value of `x` (result of repeatedly squaring the initial `x` and taking modulo `p` for each bit position of the original `y`) raised to the power of the original `y` modulo `p`. Since `y` is 0, `res` will be 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function also correctly handles large values of `y` by using an efficient exponentiation by squaring method, ensuring that the computation remains within the bounds of `p` throughout the process. After the function executes, `y` is reduced to 0, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial `x` and taking modulo `p` for each bit position of the original `y`, and `res` holds the final result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, and y is non-negative.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop over multiple iterations and identify the conditions under which the loop terminates.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `x` and `y` are integers.
    #- `y` is non-negative (`y ≥ 0`).
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #while y:
    #    x, y = y, x % y
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - Initial values: `x` (initial value), `y` (initial value).
    #   - After the first iteration:
    #     - New `x` = old `y`.
    #     - New `y` = old `x` % old `y`.
    #   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - New values after the first iteration: `x` (old `y`), `y` (old `x` % old `y`).
    #   - After the second iteration:
    #     - New `x` = old `y` (from the first iteration).
    #     - New `y` = (old `x` % old `y`) % (old `y`).
    #   - The loop will continue as long as the new `y` is non-zero.
    #
    #3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    #   - Each iteration updates `x` to the old value of `y` and `y` to the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.
    #   - The loop continues until `y` becomes zero.
    #
    #### Termination Condition:
    #- The loop terminates when `y` becomes zero.
    #- At this point, `x` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- When the loop terminates, `y` is zero.
    #- `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
    #**`y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.**
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function ensures that the GCD is correctly computed even if one or both of the inputs are zero. Specifically, if `y` is zero, the function returns `x`, and if `x` is zero, the function returns `y`. In all other cases, the function iterates through the Euclidean algorithm until `y` becomes zero, at which point `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: n is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or any other prime number up to the largest integer `i` such that \( i \times i \leq n \). `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6. If `n` is divisible by any prime number up to the largest integer `i` such that \( i \times i \leq n \), the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is not divisible by any prime number up to the largest integer `i` such that \( i \times i \leq n \), and `i` is the smallest integer greater than the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It performs the following checks: 

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For integers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all numbers of the form `6k ± 1` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1 and where `n` is 2 or 3. It also efficiently checks for primality by only considering potential divisors up to the square root of `n`.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, m, and t are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. a and b are integers provided in each iteration where a is either 0 or 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n + 1 if a is 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n - 1 if a is 0.
def func_15():
    n, k, m, t = func_3()
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = func_3()
        
        if a == 1:
            n += 1
            if b <= k:
                k += 1
        elif b < k:
            n -= b
            k -= b
        else:
            n -= n - b
        
        func_16(n, k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are updated based on the values of `a` and `b` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration, `m` remains unchanged, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t`, and `a` and `b` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` operates under the constraints that `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It iterates `t` times, where in each iteration, it receives two integers `a` and `b` from `func_3()`. If `a` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1, and if `b` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is also incremented by 1. If `a` is 0 and `b` is less than `k`, both `n` and `k` are decremented by `b`. If `a` is 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is set to `b`. After each iteration, `func_16(n, k)` is called. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies `n` and `k` based on the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration. The variable `m` remains unchanged throughout the function, and `t` is an integer within the specified range. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `k` have been updated according to the rules described, `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are the ones returned by the last call to `func_3()`.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any type and value, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'sep' defaults to a single space byte string, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline byte string, and 'flush' defaults to False.
def func_16():

        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. If `args` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True, while no data is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the keys 'end' and 'flush' (if they existed), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`, the value of `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the buffer of `file` is now empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to a specified file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separated by the value of the `sep` key (defaulting to a single space byte string), and appends the value of the `end` key (defaulting to a newline byte string) at the end. If the `flush` key is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. 

- If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is written to the file except the value of `end`.
- If `kwargs` contains keys other than 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush', these keys remain in `kwargs` after the function executes.
- The `sep` and `end` values must be byte strings; if they are not, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to write to the file.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
