You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel universes is "like travelling sideways". However, he incorrectly thought that there were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know, there will never be more than 250.

Heidi recently got her hands on a multiverse observation tool. She was able to see all n universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k-th universe.

The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m.

Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken.

More specifically, 

  * When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. 
  * When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. 



Heidi wants to perform a simulation of t decisions. Each time a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse (i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, m and t (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each of the following t lines is in one of the following formats: 

  * "1 i" — meaning that a universe is inserted at the position i (1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 
  * "0 i" — meaning that the i-th link is broken (1 ≤ i ≤ l - 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 

Output

Output t lines. Each line should contain l, the current length of the multiverse and k, the current position of the Doctor.

It is guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the multiverse will have length at most m and when the link breaking is performed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse.

Example

Input


5 2 10 4
0 1
1 1
0 4
1 2


Output


4 1
5 2
4 2
5 3

Note

The multiverse initially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second.

First, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the Doctor in the first.

Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the multiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in the second universe.

Then, the rightmost link was broken.

Finally, a universe was added between the first and the second universe.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop over multiple iterations and identify the conditions under which the loop terminates.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `x` and `y` are integers.
    #- `y` is non-negative (`y ≥ 0`).
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #while y:
    #    x, y = y, x % y
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - Initial values: `x` (initial value), `y` (initial value).
    #   - After the first iteration:
    #     - New `x` = old `y`.
    #     - New `y` = old `x` % old `y`.
    #   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is non-zero.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - New values after the first iteration: `x` (old `y`), `y` (old `x` % old `y`).
    #   - After the second iteration:
    #     - New `x` = old `y` (from the first iteration).
    #     - New `y` = (old `x` % old `y`) % (old `y`).
    #   - The loop will continue as long as the new `y` is non-zero.
    #
    #3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
    #   - Each iteration updates `x` to the old value of `y` and `y` to the remainder of the old `x` divided by the old `y`.
    #   - The loop continues until `y` becomes zero.
    #
    #### Termination Condition:
    #- The loop terminates when `y` becomes zero.
    #- At this point, `x` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- When the loop terminates, `y` is zero.
    #- `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
    #**`y` is 0, `x` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.**
    return x
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
