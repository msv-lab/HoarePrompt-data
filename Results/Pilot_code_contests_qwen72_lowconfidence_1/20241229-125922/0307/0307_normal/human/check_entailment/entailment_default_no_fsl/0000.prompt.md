You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel universes is "like travelling sideways". However, he incorrectly thought that there were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know, there will never be more than 250.

Heidi recently got her hands on a multiverse observation tool. She was able to see all n universes lined up in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the Doctor was in the k-th universe.

The tool also points out that due to restrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of universes will never exceed m.

Obviously, the multiverse is unstable because of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will randomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is broken.

More specifically, 

  * When a universe is created, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. 
  * When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating the multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will cease to exist. 



Heidi wants to perform a simulation of t decisions. Each time a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse (i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor.

Input

The first line contains four integers n, k, m and t (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

Each of the following t lines is in one of the following formats: 

  * "1 i" — meaning that a universe is inserted at the position i (1 ≤ i ≤ l + 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 
  * "0 i" — meaning that the i-th link is broken (1 ≤ i ≤ l - 1), where l denotes the current length of the multiverse. 

Output

Output t lines. Each line should contain l, the current length of the multiverse and k, the current position of the Doctor.

It is guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the multiverse will have length at most m and when the link breaking is performed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse.

Example

Input


5 2 10 4
0 1
1 1
0 4
1 2


Output


4 1
5 2
4 2
5 3

Note

The multiverse initially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second.

First, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the Doctor in the first.

Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the multiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in the second universe.

Then, the rightmost link was broken.

Finally, a universe was added between the first and the second universe.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a value, which is then converted to an integer and returned. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the function will terminate without returning a value. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer (if the input was valid) or will have raised an exception (if the input was invalid).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the user input provided when the `input()` function is called. The function waits for the user to input a string, which can be any valid input (including empty strings), and then returns that string. If the user provides no input and just presses Enter, the function will return an empty string. The final state of the program is that the user input is returned, and no other changes are made to the program's state.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of user input, expecting the input to be a space-separated string of integers. It then parses this input into a list of integers using the `map` function. However, the function does not convert the result of `map` into a tuple or list, so it returns an iterator instead of a tuple. Therefore, the function returns an iterator of integers parsed from the user input. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised when attempting to convert the input to integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes no parameters and returns a list representing the final state of the multiverse after processing a series of decisions stored in the `decisions` list. Each decision in the `decisions` list is a string in the format "1 i" or "0 i", where "1 i" indicates creating a new segment at position `i` and "0 i" indicates breaking an existing segment at position `i`. The function modifies the length of the multiverse according to these rules and returns the final state. The function assumes that the initial state of the multiverse and the `decisions` list are correctly formatted and within the specified constraints (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). If the `decisions` list contains invalid entries or if the modifications lead to an invalid state (e.g., attempting to break a segment that doesn't exist), the behavior is undefined.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  `func_5` sets up the environment by increasing the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and setting the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After `func_5` completes, the environment is configured for potentially deep recursion and larger stack usage, and the `main` function is running in a separate thread. If the `main` function raises an exception or does not terminate, the thread will continue to run independently of the main program flow.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a parameter `item`, which is expected to be a list or tuple with at least one element. It returns the first element of `item`. If `item` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the first element of `item` is returned, and no modifications are made to `item` itself.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` of elements that can be compared and sorted and a function `getKey` that defines the sorting criteria. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted according to the criteria defined by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. The function handles all types of elements that can be compared and sorted, including edge cases such as empty lists or lists with identical elements. If `getKey` is not provided or is invalid, the behavior of the function is undefined and may result in errors or unexpected results.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 250\), and `num` is an integer. It returns a 2D list consisting of `n` sublists, each containing `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function correctly handles the specified range for `n` and `m` and ensures that the returned list meets the described structure. No additional edge cases or missing functionality are observed in the provided code.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x` and returns `False` if `x` is 0. If `x` is not 0, the function returns `True` if `x` is a power of two, and `False` otherwise. This means the function effectively checks if `x` is a power of two or zero.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix. The function handles all non-negative integers correctly, including the edge case where `n` is 0, which results in the string "0". If a negative integer is passed, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `bin` function does not accept negative integers.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [i for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list where each element is a string representation of a digit from the integer `n`. For example, if `n` is 1234, the function returns `['1', '2', '3', '4']`. If `n` is 0, the function returns `['0']`. The function handles all non-negative integers, including zero, and ensures that each digit is converted to a string and included in the resulting list.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p1
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function also correctly handles large values of `y` by using an efficient exponentiation by squaring method, ensuring that the computation remains within the bounds of `p` throughout the process. After the function executes, `y` is reduced to 0, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial `x` and taking modulo `p` for each bit position of the original `y`, and `res` holds the final result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both integers, with `y` being non-negative. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function ensures that the GCD is correctly computed even if one or both of the inputs are zero. Specifically, if `y` is zero, the function returns `x`, and if `x` is zero, the function returns `y`. In all other cases, the function iterates through the Euclidean algorithm until `y` becomes zero, at which point `x` holds the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is a prime number. It performs the following checks: 

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False`.
2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `True`.
3. If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it returns `False`.
4. For integers greater than 3, it checks divisibility by all numbers of the form `6k ± 1` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns `False`.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function correctly handles edge cases where `n` is less than or equal to 1 and where `n` is 2 or 3. It also efficiently checks for primality by only considering potential divisors up to the square root of `n`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, k, m, t) = func_3()
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = func_3()
        if a == 1:
            n += 1
            if b <= k:
                k += 1
        elif b < k:
            n -= b
            k -= b
        else:
            n -= n - b
        func_16(n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` operates under the constraints that `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It iterates `t` times, where in each iteration, it receives two integers `a` and `b` from `func_3()`. If `a` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1, and if `b` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is also incremented by 1. If `a` is 0 and `b` is less than `k`, both `n` and `k` are decremented by `b`. If `a` is 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is set to `b`. After each iteration, `func_16(n, k)` is called. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies `n` and `k` based on the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration. The variable `m` remains unchanged throughout the function, and `t` is an integer within the specified range. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `k` have been updated according to the rules described, `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are the ones returned by the last call to `func_3()`.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the string representations of the positional arguments to a specified file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separated by the value of the `sep` key (defaulting to a single space byte string), and appends the value of the `end` key (defaulting to a newline byte string) at the end. If the `flush` key is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value. 

- If `args` is an empty tuple, nothing is written to the file except the value of `end`.
- If `kwargs` contains keys other than 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush', these keys remain in `kwargs` after the function executes.
- The `sep` and `end` values must be byte strings; if they are not, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to write to the file.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
