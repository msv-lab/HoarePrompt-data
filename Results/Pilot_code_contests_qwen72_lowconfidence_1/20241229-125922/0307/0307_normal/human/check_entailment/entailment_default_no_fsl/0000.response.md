Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_15` does not correctly handle the breaking of links (when `a` is 0) in all cases. Specifically, the logic for updating `n` and `k` when a link is broken is incorrect. According to the problem description, when a link is broken at position `i`, the segment not containing the Doctor should cease to exist. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly:

1. **Case when `a == 0` and `b < k`:**
   - The current implementation decrements both `n` and `k` by `b`. This is incorrect because the segment not containing the Doctor should be removed, and `k` should be adjusted accordingly. The correct logic should be:
     - If `b < k`, then the left segment is removed, and `k` should remain the same, but `n` should be reduced by the length of the left segment.
     - If `b >= k`, then the right segment is removed, and `k` should remain the same, but `n` should be reduced to `b`.

2. **Case when `a == 0` and `b >= k`:**
   - The current implementation sets `n` to `b`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the removal of the segment not containing the Doctor. The correct logic should be:
     - If `b >= k`, then the right segment is removed, and `n` should be set to `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, k, m, t) = func_3()
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = func_3()
        if a == 1:
            n += 1
            if b <= k:
                k += 1
        elif b < k:
            n -= b
        else:
            n = b
        func_16(n, k)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle the breaking of links according to the problem description. However, since the original implementation is incorrect, the correctness of the program is **False**.
