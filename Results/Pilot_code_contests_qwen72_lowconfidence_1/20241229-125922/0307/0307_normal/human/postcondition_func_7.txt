The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 250\), and `num` is an integer. It returns a 2D list consisting of `n` sublists, each containing `m` occurrences of the integer `num`. The function correctly handles the specified range for `n` and `m` and ensures that the returned list meets the described structure. No additional edge cases or missing functionality are observed in the provided code.
