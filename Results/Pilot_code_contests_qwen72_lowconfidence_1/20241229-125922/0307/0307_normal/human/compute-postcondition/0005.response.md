`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. The value of `sep` is either `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`. The states of `args`, `x`, `kwargs`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from kwargs['sep'], `file` is sys.stdout or the value from kwargs['file'], `at_start` is currently False, `sep` has been written to `file`.**
