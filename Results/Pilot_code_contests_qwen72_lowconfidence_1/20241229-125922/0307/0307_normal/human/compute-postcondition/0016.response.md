Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first, `sep`, and second elements of `args` have been written to `file`. If `at_start` is False, the string representation of another `sep` and the third element of `args` have also been written to `file`.***
