The function `func_15` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates under certain conditions involving integers `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t`, and iterates using integers `a` and `b` with specific constraints. The function's behavior changes based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Given the constraints:
- `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided in each iteration where `a` is either 0 or 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n + 1 if `a` is 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n - 1 if `a` is 0.

The function's return values are not explicitly defined in the provided output section. Therefore, I will infer the functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function `func_15` operates under the constraints that `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It iterates using integers `a` and `b` where `a` is either 0 or 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n + 1 if `a` is 1, and 1 ≤ b ≤ n - 1 if `a` is 0. The function returns a result based on these constraints, but the specific return values are not provided.**
