The values of `sep` and `file` are updated based on the `kwargs` dictionary. If 'sep' is present in `kwargs`, its value is used; otherwise, `sep` is set to `b' '`. Similarly, if 'file' is present in `kwargs`, its value is used; otherwise, `file` is set to `sys.stdout`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the 'sep' and 'file' entries if they exist.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any type and value, kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'end' defaults to a newline byte string, and 'flush' defaults to False. sep is `b' '` or the value from kwargs['sep'], file is `sys.stdout` or the value from kwargs['file']**.
