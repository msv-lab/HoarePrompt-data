The code snippet provided is:

```python
k -= b
```

### Initial State:
- `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`
- `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`
- If `a == 1`, then `n` is incremented by 1
- If `a != 1` and `b < k`, then `n` is updated to `n - b`
- If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, then `n` is updated to `b`
- If `b <= k`, then `k` is incremented by 1
- If `a != 1` and `b < k`, then `k` is updated to `k - b`
- `m` remains unchanged
- `t` remains unchanged
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `n` is updated to `n - b`

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `k` is decreased by `b`.

### Updated Values:
- `k` is now `k - b`.

### Output State:
**`a` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, if `a == 1` then `n` is incremented by 1, if `a != 1` and `b < k` then `n` is updated to `n - b`, if `a != 1` and `b >= k` then `n` is updated to `b`, if `b <= k` then `k` is incremented by 1, if `a != 1` and `b < k` then `k` is updated to `k - b`, `m` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is updated to `n - b`, `k` is `k - b`.**
