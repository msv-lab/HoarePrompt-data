The `file.flush()` method is called, which ensures that all buffered data is written to the file or stream immediately. This operation does not alter the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, since the flush operation is completed, the buffer is now empty.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the keys 'end' and 'flush' (if they existed), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`, the value of `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'` has been written to `file`, and the buffer of `file` is now empty.**
