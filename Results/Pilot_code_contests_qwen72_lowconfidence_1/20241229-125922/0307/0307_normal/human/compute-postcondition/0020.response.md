The line `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))` impacts the following:

- It writes the value associated with the key `'end'` from the dictionary `kwargs` to `file`. If `'end'` is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to `b'\n'`.
- It removes the key `'end'` from `kwargs` if it exists.

Given the initial state, the impact is:

- `file` (which is `sys.stdout` or a value specified in `kwargs['file']`) receives the byte string `b'\n'` or the value of `kwargs['end']`.
- `kwargs` no longer contains the key `'end'` if it was present.
- `args`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged unless `kwargs` modified `file`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the key 'end' (if it existed), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`, and the value of `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'` has been written to `file`.**
