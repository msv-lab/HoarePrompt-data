The value of `at_start` is set to `False`. Since this variable was already `False` in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`args`, `x`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first element of `args`, `sep`, and `x` have been written to `file`.**
