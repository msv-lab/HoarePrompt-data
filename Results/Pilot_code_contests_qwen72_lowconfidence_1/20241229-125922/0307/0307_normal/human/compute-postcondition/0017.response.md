The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`.

- `x` is the third element of `args`.
- The string representation of `x` is written to `file`.
- No other variables are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `args` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first, `sep`, and second elements of `args` have been written to `file`, and the string representation of `x` (the third element of `args`) has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first, `sep`, and second elements of `args` have been written to `file`, and the string representation of `x` (the third element of `args`) has been written to `file`.**
