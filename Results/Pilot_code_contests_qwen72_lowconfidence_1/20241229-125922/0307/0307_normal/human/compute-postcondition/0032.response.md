Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. If `b <= k`, then: if `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`; if `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`; `k` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `m` and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is incremented by 1.***
