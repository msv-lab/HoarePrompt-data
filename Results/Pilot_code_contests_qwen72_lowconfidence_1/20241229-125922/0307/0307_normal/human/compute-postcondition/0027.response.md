To determine the output state, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
2. **Execution of `func_3()`**:
   - `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
   - If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, if `a != 1`:
     - If `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`.
     - Otherwise, `n` is updated to `b`.

4. **Function Call**:
   - `func_16(n, k)` is called, but since the function itself does not modify `n` or `k` (as per the given information), the values of `n` and `k` remain as they are after the conditional logic.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `a` and `b` are now specific values returned by `func_3()`.
- Based on the values of `a` and `b`, the following updates may occur:
  - If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
  - If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
  - If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`.
  - If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is updated based on the conditions: if `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`; if `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`. `k` is updated based on the conditions: if `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`. `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `m`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
