To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is updated based on the conditions:
     - If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
     - If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`.
     - If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`.
   - `k` is updated based on the conditions:
     - If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
     - If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`.
   - `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `m`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the state:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- The other variables (`m`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, but their values might change within the loop body depending on the conditions and the function `func_3()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is updated based on the conditions: if `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`; if `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`. `k` is updated based on the conditions: if `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`. `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `m`, `t`, and `i` are updated to `m`, `t`, and `i + 1` respectively.**
