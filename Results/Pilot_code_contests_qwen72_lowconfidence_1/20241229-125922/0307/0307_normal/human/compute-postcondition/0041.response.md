Functionality: ** The function `func_15` operates under the constraints that `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It iterates `t` times, where in each iteration, it receives two integers `a` and `b` from `func_3()`. If `a` is 1, `n` is incremented by 1, and if `b` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is also incremented by 1. If `a` is 0 and `b` is less than `k`, both `n` and `k` are decremented by `b`. If `a` is 0 and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n` is set to `b`. After each iteration, `func_16(n, k)` is called. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies `n` and `k` based on the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration. The variable `m` remains unchanged throughout the function, and `t` is an integer within the specified range. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` and `k` have been updated according to the rules described, `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are the ones returned by the last call to `func_3()`. **
