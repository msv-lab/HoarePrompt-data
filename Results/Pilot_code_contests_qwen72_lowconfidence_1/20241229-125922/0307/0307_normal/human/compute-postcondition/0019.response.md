Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. If `args` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True, while no data is written to `file`.**
