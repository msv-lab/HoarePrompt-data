To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `args` is a non-empty tuple.
- `x` is the first element of `args`.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False).
- `sep` is b' ' or the value from kwargs['sep'].
- `file` is sys.stdout or the value from kwargs['file'].
- `at_start` is False.
- The string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`args`**: The loop iterates over the elements of `args`. Since `args` is a non-empty tuple, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least two elements.
2. **`x`**: After the first iteration, `x` will be the second element of `args`.
3. **`kwargs`**: This dictionary remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
4. **`sep`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
5. **`file`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
6. **`at_start`**: This variable is set to False at the end of the previous iteration. It does not affect the loop condition but might be used elsewhere in the loop body.
7. **String Representation of `x`**: The string representation of the first element of `args` has been written to `file`.

### Adjusted State:
For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `x` should now be the second element of `args`.
- `args` must have at least two elements.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from kwargs['sep'], `file` is sys.stdout or the value from kwargs['file'], `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first element of `args` has been written to `file`.**
