The code snippet provided is:
```
at_start = False
```

Since `at_start` is already set to `False` in the initial state, this line of code does not change the value of `at_start`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first, `sep`, and second elements of `args` have been written to `file`, and the string representation of `x` (the third element of `args`) has been written to `file`.**
