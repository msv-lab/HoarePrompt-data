The provided code snippet is a comment that describes what a function does (prints the values to a stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default) but does not actually execute any changes to the variables or state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any type and value, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'sep' defaults to a single space byte string, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline byte string, and 'flush' defaults to False.**
