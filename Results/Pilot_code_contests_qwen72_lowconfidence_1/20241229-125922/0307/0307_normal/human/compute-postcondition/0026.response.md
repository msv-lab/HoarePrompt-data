Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged, `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1. If `b <= k`, `k` is also incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `a != 1`, if `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`. Otherwise, `n` is updated to `b`.***
