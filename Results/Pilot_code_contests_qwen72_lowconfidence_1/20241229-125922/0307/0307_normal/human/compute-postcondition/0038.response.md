The function `func_16(n, k)` is called with the current values of `n` and `k`. The impact of this call depends on the implementation of `func_16`, which is not provided. However, based on the initial state, we can infer the following:

- `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `m` and `t` remain unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
- If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`.
- If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`.
- If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.

Since the function `func_16(n, k)` is called, we assume it does not return any value or modify the global state (unless specified otherwise).

Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` and `t` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, if `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1, if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`, if `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`, if `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.**
