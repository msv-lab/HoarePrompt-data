You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any type and value, and kwargs is a dictionary that can contain keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'sep' defaults to a single space byte string, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline byte string, and 'flush' defaults to False.
def func_16():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', b' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`. If `args` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True, while no data is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', b'\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the keys 'end' and 'flush' (if they existed), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`, the value of `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the buffer of `file` is now empty.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the positional arguments to the specified file (defaulting to `sys.stdout`), separated by the value of the `sep` key (defaulting to a single space byte string), and ends the line with the value of the `end` key (defaulting to a newline byte string). If the `flush` key is set to `True`, it flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
