Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from kwargs['sep'], `file` is sys.stdout or the value from kwargs['file'], `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first element of `args` has been written to `file`. If `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first element of `args` and `sep` have been written to `file`.***
