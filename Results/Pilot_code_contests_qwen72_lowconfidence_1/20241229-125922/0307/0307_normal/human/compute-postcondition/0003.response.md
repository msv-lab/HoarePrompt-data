To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `args` is a tuple of any type and value.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys `'end'` and `'flush'` with corresponding values. `'end'` defaults to a newline byte string (`b'\n'`), and `'flush'` defaults to `False`.
- `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`.
- `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`.
- `at_start` is `True`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for x in args:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over the elements in `args`.
- For the loop to execute, `args` must be a non-empty tuple.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check if `args` is non-empty**: If `args` is an empty tuple, the loop will not execute. Therefore, `args` must contain at least one element.
2. **Initial Value of `x`**: Before the loop starts, `x` should be the first element of `args`.

### Adjusted State:
- `args` must be a non-empty tuple.
- `x` is the first element of `args`.

### Final State:
State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple, `x` is the first element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from kwargs['sep'], `file` is sys.stdout or the value from kwargs['file'], `at_start` is True**
