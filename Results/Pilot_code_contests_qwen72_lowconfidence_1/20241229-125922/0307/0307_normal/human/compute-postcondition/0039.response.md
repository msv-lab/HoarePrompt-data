To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the possible outcomes of each iteration and how they affect the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `k`, `m`, and `t` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a` and `b` are initialized by the values returned from `func_3()`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(t):
    a, b = func_3()
    if a == 1:
        n += 1
        if b <= k:
            k += 1
    elif b < k:
        n -= b
        k -= b
    else:
        n -= n - b
    func_16(n, k)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
   - In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated by the values returned from `func_3()`.
   - The conditions inside the loop modify `n` and `k` based on the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Effect on Variables**:
   - **If `a == 1`**:
     - `n` is incremented by 1.
     - If `b ≤ k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
   - **If `a != 1` and `b < k`**:
     - `n` is decremented by `b`.
     - `k` is decremented by `b`.
   - **If `a != 1` and `b ≥ k`**:
     - `n` is set to `b`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - After each iteration, `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250` must still hold true.
   - `t` remains unchanged and is always within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Final State**:
   - After `t` iterations, `i` will be `t`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the conditions described above.
   - `a` and `b` will be the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`.

### Output State:
- **`n`** will be the final value after `t` iterations, which depends on the values of `a` and `b` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.
- **`k`** will be the final value after `t` iterations, which also depends on the values of `a` and `b` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration.
- **`m`** remains unchanged and is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 250.
- **`t`** remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- **`i`** will be `t`.
- **`a` and `b`** will be the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on the values of `a` and `b` returned by `func_3()` in each iteration, `m` remains unchanged, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is `t`, and `a` and `b` are the values returned by the last call to `func_3()`.**
