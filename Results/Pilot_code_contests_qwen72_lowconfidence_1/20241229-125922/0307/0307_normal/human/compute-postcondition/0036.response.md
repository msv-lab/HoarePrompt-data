Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `m` and `t` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b` and `k` is updated to `k - b`. If `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`. If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1 regardless of the value of `b`. If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.***
