Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any type and value, `kwargs` is a dictionary without the keys 'end' and 'flush' (if they existed), `sep` is `b' '` or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representations of all elements in `args` separated by `sep` have been written to `file`, the value of `kwargs['end']` or `b'\n'` has been written to `file`. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, the buffer of `file` is now empty.***
