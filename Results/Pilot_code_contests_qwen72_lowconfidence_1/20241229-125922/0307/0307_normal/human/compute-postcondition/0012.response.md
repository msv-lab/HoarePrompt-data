The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The variable `x` is the second element of `args`, and `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a file object specified in `kwargs['file']`.

Since `at_start` is initially `False`, the string representation of the first element of `args` and `sep` have already been written to `file`. Now, the string representation of `x` (the second element of `args`) is also written to `file`.

The values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. The only action is the additional write operation.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain keys 'end' and 'flush' with corresponding values ('end' defaults to b'\n', 'flush' defaults to False), `sep` is b' ' or the value from `kwargs['sep']`, `file` is `sys.stdout` or the value from `kwargs['file']`, `at_start` is False, the string representation of the first element of `args`, `sep`, and `x` have been written to `file`.**
