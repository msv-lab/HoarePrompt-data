Initial State: `n` is updated based on the conditions: if `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`; if `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`. `k` is updated based on the conditions: if `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1; if `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`. `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. `m`, `t`, and `i` are updated to `m`, `t`, and `i + 1` respectively.

Step-by-step Impact Analysis:
1. `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
2. `n` is updated based on the conditions:
   - If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
   - If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`.
   - If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`.
3. `k` is updated based on the conditions:
   - If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
   - If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`.
4. `m`, `t`, and `i` are updated to `m`, `t`, and `i + 1` respectively.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` returned by `func_3()` are not specified, we will use placeholders and describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Output State:
- `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`.
- `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`.
- If `a == 1`, `n` is incremented by 1.
- If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `n` is updated to `n - b`.
- If `a != 1` and `b >= k`, `n` is updated to `b`.
- If `b <= k`, `k` is incremented by 1.
- If `a != 1` and `b < k`, `k` is updated to `k - b`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, `b` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, if `a == 1` then `n` is incremented by 1, if `a != 1` and `b < k` then `n` is updated to `n - b`, if `a != 1` and `b >= k` then `n` is updated to `b`, if `b <= k` then `k` is incremented by 1, if `a != 1` and `b < k` then `k` is updated to `k - b`, `m` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**.
