The function `func_12` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. The function also correctly handles large values of `y` by using an efficient exponentiation by squaring method, ensuring that the computation remains within the bounds of `p` throughout the process. After the function executes, `y` is reduced to 0, `x` is the result of repeatedly squaring the initial `x` and taking modulo `p` for each bit position of the original `y`, and `res` holds the final result of `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`.
