Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is 0, `nCircles` must be at least 1, `index` is not 0, `area` is the first element in the `areas` list. If `index` is even, `totalArea` is updated to `areas[index] - areas[index - 1]`.***
