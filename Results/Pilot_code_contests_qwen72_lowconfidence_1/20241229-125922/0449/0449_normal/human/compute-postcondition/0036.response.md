The given code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')` prints the value of `totalArea` followed by a newline character to the standard output. The value of `totalArea` was previously calculated and is now being printed. This operation does not alter the state of any variables; it only outputs the value of `totalArea`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `totalArea` is now printed to the console. The value of `totalArea` after the multiplication by `math.pi` is retained as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is the sum of the first element in `areas` and the differences between every pair of consecutive even-indexed areas and their preceding areas multiplied by `math.pi`. If `nCircles` is 0, `totalArea` is 0. The value of `totalArea` has been printed to the console.**
