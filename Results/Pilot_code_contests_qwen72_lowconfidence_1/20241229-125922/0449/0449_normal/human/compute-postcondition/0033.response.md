Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `index` is 2, `area` is the third element in the `areas` list. If `index` is 0, `totalArea` is `areas[1] + areas[2]`. If `index` is not 0 and even, `totalArea` is the third element in the `areas` list.***
