Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique. `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.***
