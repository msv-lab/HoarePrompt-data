The value of `totalArea` is updated by adding the value of `area` to it. Since `area` is the first element in the `areas` list, and `totalArea` was initially 0, `totalArea` now holds the value of the first element in `areas`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is equal to the first element in `areas`, `nCircles` must be at least 1, `index` is 0, `area` is the first element in the `areas` list**.
