The value of `nCircles` is assigned the value read from standard input, converted to an integer. This value is expected to be within the range 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, as per the precondition for `n`. The list `ri` remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000. All integers in ri are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100**.
