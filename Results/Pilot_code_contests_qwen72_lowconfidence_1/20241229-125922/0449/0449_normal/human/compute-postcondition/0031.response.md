The code snippet updates the value of `totalArea` by adding the difference between the element at index 2 (`areas[index]`) and the element at index 1 (`areas[index - 1]`) in the `areas` list.

Let's break down the changes:
- `totalArea` was initially the second element in the `areas` list.
- After executing the code, `totalArea` is updated to `totalArea + (areas[2] - areas[1])`.

Therefore, the new value of `totalArea` is `areas[1] + (areas[2] - areas[1])`, which simplifies to `areas[2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `index` is 2, `area` is the third element in the `areas` list, `totalArea` is the third element in the `areas` list.**
