The given code snippet updates the value of `totalArea` by adding the difference between the second element (`areas[index]`) and the first element (`areas[index - 1]`) of the `areas` list.

Let's break down the impact:

- `totalArea` is initially set to the first element in `areas`.
- `index` is 1, which means `areas[index]` refers to the second element in the `areas` list.
- `areas[index - 1]` refers to the first element in the `areas` list, which is also the initial value of `totalArea`.

The code updates `totalArea` by adding the difference between the second and the first elements of `areas`.

Therefore, the updated value of `totalArea` is:
\[ \text{totalArea} = \text{areas}[0] + (\text{areas}[1] - \text{areas}[0]) = \text{areas}[1] \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is the second element in `areas`, `index` is 1, `area` is the second element in the `areas` list.**
