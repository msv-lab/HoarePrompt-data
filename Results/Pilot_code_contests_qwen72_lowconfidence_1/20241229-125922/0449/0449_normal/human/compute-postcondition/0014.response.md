The `areas.sort()` method sorts the list `areas` in ascending order. This operation does not change the length or the content of the list, only the order of its elements.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique
- `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100
- `areas` is a list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`
- `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values
- `radius` is the last value in the `input` string
- If `nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` remains an empty list, and the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output

After executing `areas.sort()`, the list `areas` is sorted in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string. If `nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` remains an empty list, and the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output.**
