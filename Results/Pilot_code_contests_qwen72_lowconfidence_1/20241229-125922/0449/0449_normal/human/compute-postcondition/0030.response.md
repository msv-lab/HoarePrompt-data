The code snippet `totalArea += area` increments the value of `totalArea` by the value of `area`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique.
- `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100.
- `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`.
- `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values.
- `radius` is the last value in the `input` string.
- `index` is 2.
- `area` is the third element in the `areas` list.
- `totalArea` is the second element in the `areas` list.

The impact of the code on the program is:

- `totalArea` is updated to `totalArea + area`.

Since `area` is the third element in the `areas` list and `totalArea` is the second element in the `areas` list, the new value of `totalArea` is `areas[1] + areas[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `index` is 2, `area` is the third element in the `areas` list, `totalArea` is `areas[1] + areas[2]`**.
