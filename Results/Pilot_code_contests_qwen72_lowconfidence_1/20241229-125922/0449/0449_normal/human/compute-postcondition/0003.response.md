The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means that no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program exits without changing the values of any variables. However, since the program has exited, the context of the variables and their values becomes irrelevant as the program state is no longer accessible.

Given the initial conditions and the immediate termination of the program due to `sys.exit()`, the only relevant piece of information is that the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output before the program exits. The values of the variables `n`, `ri`, and `nCircles` remain unchanged, but they are not accessible after the program exit.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, and the current value of `nCircles` is less than 1, the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output, and the program has terminated.**
