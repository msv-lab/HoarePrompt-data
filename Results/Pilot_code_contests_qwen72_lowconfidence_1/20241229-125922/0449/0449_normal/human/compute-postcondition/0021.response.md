The code snippet `totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]` modifies the value of `totalArea` by adding the difference between the value at the current index of `areas` and the value at the previous index of `areas`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique
- `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100
- `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`
- `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values
- `radius` is the last value in the `input` string
- `totalArea` is 0
- `nCircles` must be at least 1
- `index` is not 0
- `area` is the first element in the `areas` list
- `index` is even

After executing the code:
- `totalArea` is updated to `totalArea + (areas[index] - areas[index - 1])`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is `areas[index] - areas[index - 1]`, `nCircles` must be at least 1, `index` is not 0, `area` is the first element in the `areas` list, and `index` is even**
