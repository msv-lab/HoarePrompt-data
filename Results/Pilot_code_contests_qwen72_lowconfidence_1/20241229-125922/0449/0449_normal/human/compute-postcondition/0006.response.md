The line of code `input = sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `ri`, `nCircles`, or `areas`. The only change is that `input` now holds the value of the line read from the standard input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique. `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally. `areas` is an empty list. `input` is the line read from the standard input.**
