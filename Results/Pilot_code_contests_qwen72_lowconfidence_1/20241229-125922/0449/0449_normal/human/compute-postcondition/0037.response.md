The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, we can infer that the function should accept two parameters: `n` and `ri`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `ri` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri[i] ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique.

Since the output description is missing, I will assume the function processes these parameters and returns a result based on them. Without specific details on the output, I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, based on common programming tasks involving lists of integers, possible outputs could include:

- A modified version of the list `ri`.
- A calculated value based on the elements of `ri`.
- A boolean indicating some condition about the elements of `ri`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will provide a generic description of the function's functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` unique integers `ri` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ ri[i] ≤ 1000. The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the input values.**

If you can provide more specific details about the output, I can refine this description further.
