The function reads an integer `nCircles` and a list of `nCircles` space-separated integers from standard input. It calculates the sum of the areas of circles with radii given by these integers, where the area of each circle is calculated as \( \pi \times r^2 \). The function then writes the total area to the standard output. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the function writes '0\n' to the standard output and terminates. If `nCircles` is 1, the total area is simply the area of the single circle. For more than one circle, the function sums the area of the first circle and the differences between the areas of every pair of consecutive even-indexed circles and their preceding circles. The function ensures that the input integers are unique and within the specified range (1 ≤ `nCircles` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000).
