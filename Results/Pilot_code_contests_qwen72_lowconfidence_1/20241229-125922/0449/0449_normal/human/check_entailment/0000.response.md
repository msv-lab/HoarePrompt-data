Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where `nCircles` is greater than the number of radii provided in the input. Specifically, the program reads the number of circles (`nCircles`) and then attempts to read the radii from the next line. However, if the number of radii provided is less than `nCircles`, the program will not handle this discrepancy correctly and will likely result in an error or incorrect output.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 3
```
Here, `nCircles` is 4, but only 3 radii are provided. The program will attempt to split the input and process it, but since there are fewer radii than expected, it will either fail or produce an incorrect result. This violates the problem's requirement that the program should handle all potential cases correctly.
