You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he found a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a plane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into several parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted blue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that is, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the other. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was painted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of the wall.

Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their centers coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are concentric.

Input

The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000) — the circles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different.

Output

Print the single real number — total area of the part of the wall that is painted red. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Note

In the first sample the picture is just one circle of radius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part equals π × 12 = π.

In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4 and 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the second and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the third is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is painted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and the third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the red parts is equal (π × 42 - π × 22) + π × 12 = π × 12 + π = 13π
Program:
```

def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if nCircles < 1:
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has an issue with handling the case where the number of circles is odd and greater than 1. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the area for the last segment when the number of circles is odd. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. The program reads the number of circles `nCircles` and the radii of the circles.
2. It sorts the areas (which are the squares of the radii).
3. It initializes `totalArea` to 0.
4. It iterates through the sorted areas and adds/subtracts the areas based on the index being even or odd.

However, when the number of circles is odd and greater than 1, the last segment (the outermost red segment) is not correctly calculated. The program only adds the area of the smallest circle and then alternates adding and subtracting the differences between consecutive areas. This means that the last segment, which should be added, is not included in the total area.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 4 2
```
The sorted radii are `[1, 2, 4]`. The areas are `[1, 4, 16]`.

- The program starts with `totalArea = 1` (area of the smallest circle).
- It then adds `4 - 1 = 3` (area between the first and second circle).
- It does not add the area between the second and third circle, which should be `16 - 4 = 12`.

Thus, the total area calculated is `1 + 3 = 4`, but it should be `1 + 3 + 12 = 16`.

To fix this, the program should handle the last segment correctly when the number of circles is odd. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
import math

def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if nCircles < 1:
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        else:
            totalArea -= areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the last segment is correctly added when the number of circles is odd.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and ri is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000. All integers in ri are unique.
def func():
    nCircles = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    if (nCircles < 1) :
        sys.stdout.write('0\n')
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique. `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues executing normally.
    areas = []
    input = sys.stdin.readline()
    for radius in input.split(' '):
        areas.append(int(radius) * int(radius))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000, and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string. If `nCircles` is less than 1, `areas` remains an empty list, and the string '0\n' has been written to the standard output.
    areas.sort()
    totalArea = 0
    for (index, area) in enumerate(areas):
        if index == 0:
            totalArea += area
        elif index % 2 == 0:
            totalArea += areas[index] - areas[index - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `ri` is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ ri ≤ 1000 and all integers in `ri` are unique, `nCircles` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ nCircles ≤ 100, `areas` is a sorted list with `nCircles` elements where each element is the square of the corresponding integer value in `input`, `input` is a string containing `nCircles` space-separated values, `radius` is the last value in the `input` string, `totalArea` is the sum of the first element in `areas` and the differences between every pair of consecutive even-indexed areas and their preceding areas. If `nCircles` is 0, `totalArea` is 0.
    totalArea *= math.pi
    sys.stdout.write(str(totalArea) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `nCircles` and a list of `nCircles` space-separated integers from standard input. It calculates the sum of the areas of circles with radii given by these integers, where the area of each circle is calculated as \( \pi \times r^2 \). The function then writes the total area to the standard output. If `nCircles` is less than 1, the function writes '0\n' to the standard output and terminates. If `nCircles` is 1, the total area is simply the area of the single circle. For more than one circle, the function sums the area of the first circle and the differences between the areas of every pair of consecutive even-indexed circles and their preceding circles. The function ensures that the input integers are unique and within the specified range (1 ≤ `nCircles` ≤ 100, 1 ≤ `ri` ≤ 1000).
