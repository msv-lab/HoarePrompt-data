You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are N cards placed face down in a row. On each card, an integer 1 or 2 is written.

Let A_i be the integer written on the i-th card.

Your objective is to guess A_1, A_2, ..., A_N correctly.

You know the following facts:

* For each i = 1, 2, ..., M, the value A_{X_i} + A_{Y_i} + Z_i is an even number.



You are a magician and can use the following magic any number of times:

Magic: Choose one card and know the integer A_i written on it. The cost of using this magic is 1.

What is the minimum cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N?

It is guaranteed that there is no contradiction in given input.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq X_i < Y_i \leq N
* 1 \leq Z_i \leq 100
* The pairs (X_i, Y_i) are distinct.
* There is no contradiction in input. (That is, there exist integers A_1, A_2, ..., A_N that satisfy the conditions.)

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
X_1 Y_1 Z_1
X_2 Y_2 Z_2
\vdots
X_M Y_M Z_M


Output

Print the minimum total cost required to determine all of A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.
