To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\).
- `acc` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(1, 1 + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `acc` is 1.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
- **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### New State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `M` remains \(10^9 + 7\).
- `acc` remains 1 (since the loop body was omitted, we assume no changes to `acc`).

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\), `acc` is 1**
