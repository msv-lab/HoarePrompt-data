The value of `acc` is updated to `acc * i % M`. Given the initial values, `acc` was 2, `i` is 3, and `M` is \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, `acc` becomes \(2 * 3 \% (10^9 + 7)\), which simplifies to 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), `acc` is 6**
