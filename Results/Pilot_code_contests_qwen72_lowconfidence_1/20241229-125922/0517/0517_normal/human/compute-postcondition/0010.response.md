Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` such that 0 <= `n` <= 500000. It computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and returns this value. The function ensures that the result is always within the range [0, \(10^9 + 7\) - 1]. Edge cases are handled correctly, including when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 1 (since 0! is defined as 1). **
