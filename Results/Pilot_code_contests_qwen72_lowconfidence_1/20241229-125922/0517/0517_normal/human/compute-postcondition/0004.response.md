The code `acc = acc * i % M` updates the value of `acc` by multiplying its current value by `i` and then taking the modulus of `M`. Given the initial state, let's calculate the new value of `acc`.

- Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\), `acc` is 1.

Step-by-step calculation:
1. `acc` starts with the value 1.
2. `i` is 2.
3. `M` is \(10^9 + 7\).
4. The new value of `acc` is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{new\_acc} = (1 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   \[
   \text{new\_acc} = 2 \% (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   Since 2 is less than \(10^9 + 7\), the modulus operation does not change the value:
   \[
   \text{new\_acc} = 2
   \]

Therefore, the updated value of `acc` is 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\), `acc` is 2**
