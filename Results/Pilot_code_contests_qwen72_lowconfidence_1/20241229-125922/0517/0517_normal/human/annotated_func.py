#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= 500000, and M is a constant integer equal to 10^9 + 7.
def func_1(n):
    acc = 1
    for i in xrange(1, 1 + n):
        acc = acc * i % M
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 500000, `M` is a constant integer equal to \(10^9 + 7\), `acc` is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\)
    return acc
    #The program returns `acc`, which is the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 500000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` such that 0 <= `n` <= 500000. It computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and returns this value. The function ensures that the result is always within the range [0, \(10^9 + 7\) - 1]. Edge cases are handled correctly, including when `n` is 0, in which case the function returns 1 (since 0! is defined as 1).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer, and M is an integer greater than 2.
def func_2(n):
    return pow(n, M - 2, M)
    #The program returns the result of n raised to the power of (M - 2), modulo M, where n is an integer, and M is an integer greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer. It implicitly assumes another parameter `M` is defined outside the function, where `M` is an integer greater than 2. The function returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `(M - 2)`, modulo `M`. 

However, the function definition only includes `n` as a parameter, and `M` is not passed explicitly. This can lead to issues if `M` is not defined or is not an integer greater than 2 before calling the function. If `M` is not properly defined, the function will raise an error. Additionally, if `M` is 2 or less, the behavior of the function is undefined because the modulo operation might not behave as expected.
