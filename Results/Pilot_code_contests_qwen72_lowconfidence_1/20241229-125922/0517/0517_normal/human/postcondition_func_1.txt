The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is an integer. It implicitly assumes another parameter `M` is defined outside the function, where `M` is an integer greater than 2. The function returns the result of `n` raised to the power of `(M - 2)`, modulo `M`. 

However, the function definition only includes `n` as a parameter, and `M` is not passed explicitly. This can lead to issues if `M` is not defined or is not an integer greater than 2 before calling the function. If `M` is not properly defined, the function will raise an error. Additionally, if `M` is 2 or less, the behavior of the function is undefined because the modulo operation might not behave as expected.
