Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and the modular inverse of a number, respectively. However, these functions alone do not solve the problem described. The problem requires computing the sum of the page numbers of all possible permutations that match the partially known permutation, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The program does not include any logic to handle the permutation matching or the summation of the page numbers, which are crucial parts of the problem. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
