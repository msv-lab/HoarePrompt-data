Final: **True**

Reasoning:
- The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the program's state and logic, which aligns with the problem description.
- The program correctly handles the input and processes the permutation to compute the sum of the page numbers of the pages that need to be checked, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately within the main logic of the program to calculate factorials and modular inverses, which are essential for solving the problem.
- The program correctly accounts for the known and unknown elements in the permutation, and it calculates the required sum by considering the positions of the missing elements and their contributions to the lexicographical order.
- The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state at each step, ensuring that the final result is computed accurately.

Therefore, the original assessment of **False** was incorrect, and the program is indeed correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
