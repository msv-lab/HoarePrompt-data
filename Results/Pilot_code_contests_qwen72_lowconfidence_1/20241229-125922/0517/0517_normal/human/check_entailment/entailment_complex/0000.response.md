Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the computation of the sum of the page numbers of the pages Mr. Takahashi has to check, especially when considering edge cases and the constraints of the problem.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling of Missing Elements**:
   - The code uses a variable `avg_missing` which is computed as the average of the missing elements. However, this approach is flawed because the average of the missing elements does not necessarily represent the correct position of the missing elements in the permutation.
   - The code assumes that the average of the missing elements can be used to compute the contribution of the missing elements to the page number, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve considering all possible permutations of the missing elements and their positions in the permutation.

2. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the factorial of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, the way it is used in the main code is not entirely clear and may not be correct for all cases.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly computes the modular inverse of `n` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, the usage of this function in the main code is not well-justified, and it is unclear how it contributes to the final result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the permutation is completely known (i.e., no missing elements) or where the permutation is completely unknown (i.e., all elements are missing) correctly. For example, the test case where all elements are missing (`P_i = 0` for all `i`) should return the sum of all possible permutations, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
3
0 0 0
```
The correct output should be the sum of the page numbers of all permutations of length 3, which is:
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21
```
However, the current implementation may not produce this correct output due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
