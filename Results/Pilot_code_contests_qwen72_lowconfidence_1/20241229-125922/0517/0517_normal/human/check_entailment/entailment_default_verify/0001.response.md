Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which compute the factorial of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and the modular inverse, respectively. These functions alone do not solve the problem as described. The problem requires computing the sum of the page numbers of all possible permutations that match the given partial permutation, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The provided code does not include any logic to handle the permutation checking, the calculation of the sum of page numbers, or the handling of the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem.

The output hints for `func_2` highlight that the function assumes `M` is defined outside the function, which is a potential issue if `M` is not properly defined. However, this is not the primary reason the program is incorrect; the main issue is the lack of the necessary logic to solve the problem as specified.
