Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle a critical edge case correctly, which is when the input permutation is completely known (i.e., no elements are 0). According to the problem description, if Mr. Takahashi remembers the entire permutation, he only needs to look up that specific permutation in the dictionary, which corresponds to its lexicographical position.

However, the current implementation of the program does not handle this case correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` is used to compute modular inverses, but it is called even when there are no missing elements, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 5 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
The current implementation will likely produce an incorrect result because it still attempts to compute the average of the missing elements and other unnecessary calculations, even though there are no missing elements.

To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to see if there are any missing elements. If there are no missing elements, the program should directly compute the lexicographical position of the given permutation and return it.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
if n_missing == 0:
    # If no elements are missing, compute the lexicographical position directly
    inv_factorial = [1] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        inv_factorial[i] = inv_factorial[M % i] * (M - M // i) % M
    factorial = [1] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % M
    rank = 0
    for i in range(N):
        count = 0
        for j in range(i + 1, N):
            if a[j] < a[i]:
                count += 1
        rank = (rank + count * factorial[N - 1 - i]) % M
    print((rank + 1) % M)
else:
    # Original logic for the case with missing elements
    # ...
```

This change ensures that the program handles the case where the permutation is completely known correctly, thus making the program correct for every potential case.
