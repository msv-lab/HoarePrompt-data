The value of `check` is set to `False`. Since `check` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. `check` is `False`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.**
