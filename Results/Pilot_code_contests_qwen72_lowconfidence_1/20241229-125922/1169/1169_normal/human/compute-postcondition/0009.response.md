The code snippet sets `check` to `False`. This overrides the condition in the initial state where `check` might have been `True`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. If `ls[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `check` is `False` and `i` is `k + 1`. Otherwise, `check` is `False` and `i` is `k + 1`. `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
