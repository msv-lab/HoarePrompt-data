The code snippet `tmp = ls[k - 1]` assigns the value of the `k-1` indexed element of the list `ls` to the variable `tmp`.

- `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `tmp` is now assigned the value of `ls[k - 1]`.

Since `k` is within the bounds of the list `ls`, `tmp` will hold a valid integer value from the list `ls`, which is also between 1 and 105.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list of integers `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`.**
