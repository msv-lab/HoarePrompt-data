The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105. The list `a` has a length of `n`, and each element `ai` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105.

The function returns a result based on the provided parameters, but the specific output is not described in the given constraints. To accurately describe the functionality, we need more details about the expected output. However, based on the given information:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105. The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
