Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. `check` is `False`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 2`. If `ls[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, the condition is met and the program continues with this state. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state as before the if statement.***
