Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. After the loop, `check` is `True` if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `check` is `False`. The current value of `check` is `True`.***
