To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run based on the given state and the loop statement.

Given state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105.
- The list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105.
- `ls` is a list of integers with length `n`, and each element is between 1 and 105.
- `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`.
- `check` is `True`.

Loop statement:
```python
for i in range(k, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(k, n)`.
   - This means `i` starts at `k` and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Condition for the loop to execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(k, n)` must contain at least one value.
   - This implies that `k` must be less than `n`.

3. **Initial state of `i`:**
   - Before the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be set to `k`.

4. **Other variables:**
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ls`, `tmp`, and `check` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `k` is less than `n` and set `i` to `k`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`; `check` is `True`, `i` is `k`.**
