The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively, and these values replace the initial values of `n` and `k`. The list `a` and its properties (length `n`, elements between 1 and 105) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list of integers `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105.**
