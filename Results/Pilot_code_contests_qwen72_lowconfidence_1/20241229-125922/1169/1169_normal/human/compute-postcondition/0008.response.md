According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k`, and `n` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Additionally, the state of `check` and `tmp` will depend on the value of `ls[i]` when `i` is incremented. However, since we don't know the specific values of `ls[i]` at this point, we can only assume that the conditions for `check` and `tmp` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented from `k` to `k + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute.
- `check` and `tmp` remain in their current state unless the loop body changes them, but based on the given information, they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. If `ls[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `check` is `False` and `i` is `k + 1`. Otherwise, `check` remains `True` and `i` is `k + 1`. `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**
