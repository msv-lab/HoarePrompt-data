The code snippet `print(k - 1)` prints the value of `k - 1` to the console. This operation does not alter any variables or states within the program.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the only addition being the printed value of `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. After the loop, `check` is `True` if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `check` is `False`. The current value of `check` is `True`. The value `k - 1` has been printed.**
