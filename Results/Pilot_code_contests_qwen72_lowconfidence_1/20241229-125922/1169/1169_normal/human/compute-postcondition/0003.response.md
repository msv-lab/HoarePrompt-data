The code snippet `check = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `check`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list of integers `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`; `check` is `True`.**
