The line of code `ls = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `ls`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105.
- The list of integers `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105.

After executing the code:
- `ls` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The length of `ls` is `n`.
- Each element in `ls` is an integer between 1 and 105.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list of integers `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105.**
