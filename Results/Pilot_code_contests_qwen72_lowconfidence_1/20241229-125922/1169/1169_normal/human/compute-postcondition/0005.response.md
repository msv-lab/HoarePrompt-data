Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`; `check` is `True`, `i` is `k`. The current value of `ls[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.***
