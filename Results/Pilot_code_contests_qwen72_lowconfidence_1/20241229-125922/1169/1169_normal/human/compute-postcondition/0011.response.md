According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `k` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `k + 2`.
- For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `ls`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop iteration itself.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. `check` is `False`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.**
