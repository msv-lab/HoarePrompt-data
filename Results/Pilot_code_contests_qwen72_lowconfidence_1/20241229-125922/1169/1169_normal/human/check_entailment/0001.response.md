Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the sequence can become uniform through multiple operations but is not initially uniform from the k-th element onwards.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

**Input:**
```
4 2
1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

### Explanation of the Failure:

1. **Initial Sequence:** `[1, 2, 2, 1]`
2. **After 1st Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 2, 1, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[2, 2, 1]`
3. **After 2nd Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 1, 2, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[1, 2, 2]`
4. **After 3rd Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[2, 2, 2]`

After 3 operations, the sequence becomes `[2, 2, 2]`, which is uniform. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the operations until the sequence becomes uniform or determine that it is impossible. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Simulate the operations
    operations = 0
    while len(set(ls)) > 1:
        if len(ls) < k:
            print(-1)
            return
        new_element = ls[k - 1]
        ls.append(new_element)
        ls.pop(0)
        operations += 1
    
    print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the operations and checks if the sequence becomes uniform. If the sequence length becomes less than `k` before becoming uniform, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations required.
