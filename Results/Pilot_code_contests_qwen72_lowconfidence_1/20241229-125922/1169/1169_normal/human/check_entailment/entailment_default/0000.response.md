Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function checks if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to the element at index `k-1`. If this condition is met, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, this approach is incorrect because it fails to consider the actual operations described in the problem statement. The problem requires simulating the operations of finding the k-th element, appending it to the end, and removing the first element until all elements are the same or determining that it is impossible.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4 2
1 2 2 2
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of operations would be:
1. Initial sequence: `[1, 2, 2, 2]`
2. After the first operation: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`

After one operation, all elements are the same, so the correct output should be `1`.

However, the provided code will check if all elements from index `2` to `n-1` (i.e., `[2, 2, 2]`) are equal to the element at index `1` (which is `2`). This condition is true, so the code will print `1`, which is correct in this specific case.

But consider another input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4
```

The sequence of operations would be:
1. Initial sequence: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
2. After the first operation: `[2, 3, 4, 2]`
3. After the second operation: `[3, 4, 2, 3]`
4. After the third operation: `[4, 2, 3, 4]`
5. After the fourth operation: `[2, 3, 4, 2]`

It is clear that the sequence will cycle and never become all the same. The correct output should be `-1`.

However, the provided code will check if all elements from index `2` to `n-1` (i.e., `[3, 4]`) are equal to the element at index `1` (which is `2`). This condition is false, so the code will print `-1`, which is correct in this specific case.

### Conclusion:
The code does not simulate the operations described in the problem and instead relies on a simplified check that does not cover all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
