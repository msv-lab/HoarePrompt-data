You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day shooshuns found a sequence of n integers, written on a blackboard. The shooshuns can perform one operation with it, the operation consists of two steps:

  1. Find the number that goes k-th in the current sequence and add the same number to the end of the sequence; 
  2. Delete the first number of the current sequence. 



The shooshuns wonder after how many operations all numbers on the board will be the same and whether all numbers will ever be the same.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the sequence that the shooshuns found.

Output

Print the minimum number of operations, required for all numbers on the blackboard to become the same. If it is impossible to achieve, print -1.

Examples

Input

3 2
3 1 1


Output

1


Input

3 1
3 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first test case after the first operation the blackboard will have sequence [1, 1, 1]. So, one operation is enough to make all numbers the same. Thus, the answer equals one.

In the second test case the sequence will never consist of the same numbers. It will always contain at least two distinct numbers 3 and 1. Thus, the answer equals -1.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ls = map(int, raw_input().split())
    tmp = ls[k - 1]
    check = True
    for i in range(k, n):
        if ls[i] != tmp:
            check = False
    if check:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the sequence can become uniform through multiple operations but is not initially uniform from the k-th element onwards.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

**Input:**
```
4 2
1 2 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

### Explanation of the Failure:

1. **Initial Sequence:** `[1, 2, 2, 1]`
2. **After 1st Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 2, 1, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[2, 2, 1]`
3. **After 2nd Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 1, 2, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[1, 2, 2]`
4. **After 3rd Operation:**
   - Find the 2nd element: `2`
   - Add `2` to the end: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
   - Remove the first element: `[2, 2, 2]`

After 3 operations, the sequence becomes `[2, 2, 2]`, which is uniform. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the operations until the sequence becomes uniform or determine that it is impossible. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Simulate the operations
    operations = 0
    while len(set(ls)) > 1:
        if len(ls) < k:
            print(-1)
            return
        new_element = ls[k - 1]
        ls.append(new_element)
        ls.pop(0)
        operations += 1
    
    print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the operations and checks if the sequence becomes uniform. If the sequence length becomes less than `k` before becoming uniform, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations required.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `ls`. It then checks if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to the element at index `k-1`. If this condition is met, the function prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing one of the two values. The function assumes that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105` and each element `ai` in `ls` satisfies `1 ≤ ai ≤ 105`. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 (meaning the entire list is checked) or when `k` is `n` (meaning no elements are checked beyond the initial one). If the input does not meet the expected constraints, the behavior of the function is undefined.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
