Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial sequence already has all the same numbers. According to the problem description, if all numbers are already the same, the output should be 0 (since no operations are needed). However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `k - 1` in such a case. For example, if the input is:

```
3 2
1 1 1
```

The program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `0`.
