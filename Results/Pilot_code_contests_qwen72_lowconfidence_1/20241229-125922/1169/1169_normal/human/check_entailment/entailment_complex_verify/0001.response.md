Final: **False**

### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the sequence can become uniform through multiple operations but is not initially uniform from the k-th element onwards.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `ls` is a list of integers with length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies \(1 \leq ai \leq 10^5\).

2. **After the For Loop:**
   - `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`.
   - `check` is `True` if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `check` is `False`.

3. **After the If-Else Block:**
   - If `check` is `True`, the function prints `k - 1`.
   - If `check` is `False`, the function prints `-1`.

#### Analysis:
- **Correctness Check:**
  - The program checks if all elements from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to the element at index `k-1`.
  - If this condition is met, it prints `k - 1`.
  - If not, it prints `-1`.

- **Failure Case:**
  - Consider the input:
    ```
    4 2
    1 2 2 1
    ```
  - Initial sequence: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`
  - After 1st operation: `[2, 2, 1, 2]` (Add 2, remove 1)
  - After 2nd operation: `[2, 1, 2, 2]` (Add 2, remove 2)
  - After 3rd operation: `[1, 2, 2, 2]` (Add 2, remove 2)
  - After 4th operation: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (Add 2, remove 1)

  - The sequence becomes uniform after 3 operations, but the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it only checks the initial state and does not simulate the operations.

#### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the sequence can become uniform through multiple operations.
- The annotated code confirms that the program only checks the initial state and does not simulate the operations, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect. Final: **False**.
