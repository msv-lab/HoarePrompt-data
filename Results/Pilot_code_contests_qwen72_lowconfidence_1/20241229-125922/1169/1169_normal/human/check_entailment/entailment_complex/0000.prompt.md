You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One day shooshuns found a sequence of n integers, written on a blackboard. The shooshuns can perform one operation with it, the operation consists of two steps:

  1. Find the number that goes k-th in the current sequence and add the same number to the end of the sequence; 
  2. Delete the first number of the current sequence. 



The shooshuns wonder after how many operations all numbers on the board will be the same and whether all numbers will ever be the same.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the sequence that the shooshuns found.

Output

Print the minimum number of operations, required for all numbers on the blackboard to become the same. If it is impossible to achieve, print -1.

Examples

Input

3 2
3 1 1


Output

1


Input

3 1
3 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first test case after the first operation the blackboard will have sequence [1, 1, 1]. So, one operation is enough to make all numbers the same. Thus, the answer equals one.

In the second test case the sequence will never consist of the same numbers. It will always contain at least two distinct numbers 3 and 1. Thus, the answer equals -1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105. The list of integers a has length n, and each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ls = map(int, raw_input().split())
    tmp = ls[k - 1]
    check = True
    for i in range(k, n):
        if ls[i] != tmp:
            check = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. After the loop, `check` is `True` if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `check` is `False`.
    if check :
        print(k - 1)
    else :
        print(-1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105, the list `a` has length `n`, and each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 105; `ls` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is between 1 and 105; `tmp` is the integer value of `ls[k - 1]`. After the loop, `check` is `True` if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`, otherwise `check` is `False`. If `check` is `True`, the value `k - 1` has been printed. If `check` is `False`, it indicates that not all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `tmp`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of `n` integers `ls`. It then checks if all elements in `ls` from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to the element at index `k-1`. If this condition is met, the function prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing one of the two values. The function assumes that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105` and each element `ai` in `ls` satisfies `1 ≤ ai ≤ 105`. Potential edge cases include when `k` is 1 (meaning the entire list is checked) or when `k` is `n` (meaning no elements are checked beyond the initial one). If the input does not meet the expected constraints, the behavior of the function is undefined.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
