Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Check for Uniformity:**
   - The program checks if all elements from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to `ls[k-1]`. However, the problem description requires determining if all elements on the blackboard will eventually become the same after performing the specified operations.
   - The program does not simulate the operations described in the problem. It only checks the initial state of the list from index `k` to `n-1` and does not consider the effect of repeatedly adding and removing elements.

2. **Simulation of Operations:**
   - The problem requires simulating the operations where the `k`-th element is added to the end of the list, and the first element is removed. The program should continue this process until either all elements are the same or it is determined that they will never be the same.
   - The provided program does not simulate these operations, which means it cannot correctly determine the minimum number of operations needed or if it is impossible to achieve the goal.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4 2
1 2 2 1
```

- **Expected Output:** The correct output should be `2` because after 2 operations, the sequence becomes `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.

- **Actual Output:** The program will output `-1` because it only checks the initial state from index `k` to `n-1` and finds that not all elements are equal to `ls[k-1]`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Simulate the operations described in the problem.
2. Track the changes in the list and count the number of operations.
3. Determine if all elements become the same and return the minimum number of operations or `-1` if it is impossible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    operations = 0
    while len(set(ls)) > 1:
        if len(ls) < k:
            print(-1)
            return
        ls.append(ls[k-1])
        ls.pop(0)
        operations += 1
    
    print(operations)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version simulates the operations and correctly determines the minimum number of operations needed or returns `-1` if it is impossible.
