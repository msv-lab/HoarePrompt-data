Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the sequence can become uniform after a certain number of operations even if the initial conditions do not meet the criteria set in the program.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
4 2
2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
The sequence can become uniform after 2 operations:
1. After the first operation: `[1, 2, 1, 1]`
2. After the second operation: `[2, 1, 1, 2]`
3. After the third operation: `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
4. After the fourth operation: `[1, 2, 1, 1]`
5. After the fifth operation: `[2, 1, 1, 2]`
6. After the sixth operation: `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
7. After the seventh operation: `[1, 2, 1, 1]`
8. After the eighth operation: `[2, 1, 1, 2]`
9. After the ninth operation: `[1, 1, 2, 1]`
10. After the tenth operation: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`

The expected output is `10`.

**Actual Output:**
The program will output `-1` because it only checks if the elements from index `k` to `n-1` are equal to the element at index `k-1`, which they are not in this case.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
