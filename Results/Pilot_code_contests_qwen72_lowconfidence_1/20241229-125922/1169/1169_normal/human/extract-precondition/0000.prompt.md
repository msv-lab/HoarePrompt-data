You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: One day shooshuns found a sequence of n integers, written on a blackboard. The shooshuns can perform one operation with it, the operation consists of two steps:

  1. Find the number that goes k-th in the current sequence and add the same number to the end of the sequence; 
  2. Delete the first number of the current sequence. 



The shooshuns wonder after how many operations all numbers on the board will be the same and whether all numbers will ever be the same.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the sequence that the shooshuns found.

Output

Print the minimum number of operations, required for all numbers on the blackboard to become the same. If it is impossible to achieve, print -1.

Examples

Input

3 2
3 1 1


Output

1


Input

3 1
3 1 1


Output

-1

Note

In the first test case after the first operation the blackboard will have sequence [1, 1, 1]. So, one operation is enough to make all numbers the same. Thus, the answer equals one.

In the second test case the sequence will never consist of the same numbers. It will always contain at least two distinct numbers 3 and 1. Thus, the answer equals -1.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
