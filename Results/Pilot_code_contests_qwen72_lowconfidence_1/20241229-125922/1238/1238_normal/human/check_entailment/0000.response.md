Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical issue that affects its correctness. Specifically, the way it handles the calculation of `c3` and `c4` for the last level is flawed. The code incorrectly assumes that the cost to move to the next level (`c3` and `c4`) should be calculated even when `i` is the last level. This leads to an incorrect final answer.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2 1 3 4 3
3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
13
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
1. In the first level, Ziota uses the pistol to kill 3 normal monsters (3 * 1 = 3 seconds) and AWP to kill the boss (4 seconds). Total time: 7 seconds.
2. Move to the second level (3 seconds). Total time: 10 seconds.
3. In the second level, Ziota uses the pistol to kill 1 normal monster (1 * 1 = 1 second) and AWP to kill the boss (4 seconds). Total time: 10 seconds.

The total time is 10 seconds, but the program outputs 13 seconds due to the incorrect handling of the last level. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
