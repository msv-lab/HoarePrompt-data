### Analysis of the Program

The program is designed to solve the problem described in the "Monster Invaders" game. The goal is to determine the minimum time required to kill all the bosses in all levels while adhering to the constraints of the game.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Monsters and Guns:**
  - Normal monster: 1 HP.
  - Boss: 2 HP.
  - Piston: 1 HP damage, \( r_1 \) reload time.
  - Laser gun: 1 HP damage to all monsters, \( r_2 \) reload time.
  - AWP: Instantly kills any monster, \( r_3 \) reload time.
- **Levels:**
  - Each level \( i \) has \( a_i \) normal monsters and 1 boss.
  - Ziota can only use the Pistol or AWP on the boss after killing all normal monsters in the level.
- **Movement:**
  - Moving between adjacent levels takes \( d \) time.
  - Ziota cannot reload or shoot during movement.
- **Objective:**
  - Kill all bosses in all levels with the minimum time.

### Program Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program reads the input values correctly:
  - \( n, r_1, r_2, r_3, d \) from the first line.
  - \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) from the second line.
- These values are stored in variables and used appropriately.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach
- The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum time required to complete the game.
- It maintains two states:
  - \( c1 \): Minimum cost to complete the current level and be ready to move to the next level.
  - \( c2 \): Minimum cost to complete the current level and be ready to move back to a previous level.
- For each level \( i \), it calculates:
  - \( indcost \): Cost of using AWP to kill the boss and Pistol to kill all normal monsters.
  - \( aoecost \): Cost of using the Laser gun to kill all monsters and the boss.
  - \( mincost \): Minimum of \( indcost \) and \( aoecost \).
  - \( mincost2l \): Minimum cost to move to the next level and back.
  - \( oto \): Cost to move to the next level and stay there.
  - \( ott \): Cost to move to the next level and then back to the current level.
  - \( ttt \): Cost to stay in the current level and then move to the next level.
  - \( tto \): Cost to stay in the current level and then move back to the previous level.
- It updates \( c1 \) and \( c2 \) based on these costs.

#### Final Calculation
- After processing all levels, the program calculates the minimum of \( c1 \) and \( c2 \) and subtracts \( d \) to account for the final move.

### Correctness Evaluation

#### Positive Aspects
- The program correctly reads the input and processes the data.
- It uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the minimum time.
- The state transitions and cost calculations are aligned with the problem constraints.

#### Potential Issues
- The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead.
- The program assumes that the input will always be valid, which is consistent with the problem statement's assumption.

### Conclusion
Given the problem description and the analysis of the program, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
