You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Ziota found a video game called "Monster Invaders".

Similar to every other shooting RPG game, "Monster Invaders" involves killing monsters and bosses with guns.

For the sake of simplicity, we only consider two different types of monsters and three different types of guns.

Namely, the two types of monsters are: 

  * a normal monster with 1 hp. 
  * a boss with 2 hp. 



And the three types of guns are: 

  * Pistol, deals 1 hp in damage to one monster, r_1 reloading time 
  * Laser gun, deals 1 hp in damage to all the monsters in the current level (including the boss), r_2 reloading time 
  * AWP, instantly kills any monster, r_3 reloading time 



The guns are initially not loaded, and the Ziota can only reload 1 gun at a time.

The levels of the game can be considered as an array a_1, a_2, …, a_n, in which the i-th stage has a_i normal monsters and 1 boss. Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first type of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing all of the a_i normal monsters.

If Ziota damages the boss but does not kill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an arbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level i (1 < i < n) are levels i - 1 and i + 1, the only adjacent level of level 1 is level 2, the only adjacent level of level n is level n - 1). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time. Each move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with d teleportation time.

In order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within the game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during teleportation. 

Ziota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns). Please help him find this value.

Input

The first line of the input contains five integers separated by single spaces: n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of stages, r_1, r_2, r_3 (1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9) — the reload time of the three guns respectively, d (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9) — the time of moving between adjacent levels.

The second line of the input contains n integers separated by single spaces a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

Output

Print one integer, the minimum time to finish the game.

Note

In the first test case, the optimal strategy is:

  * Use the pistol to kill three normal monsters and AWP to kill the boss (Total time 1⋅3+4=7) 
  * Move to stage two (Total time 7+3=10) 
  * Use the pistol twice and AWP to kill the boss (Total time 10+1⋅2+4=16) 
  * Move to stage three (Total time 16+3=19) 
  * Use the laser gun and forced to move to either stage four or two, here we move to stage four (Total time 19+3+3=25) 
  * Use the pistol once, use AWP to kill the boss (Total time 25+1⋅1+4=30) 
  * Move back to stage three (Total time 30+3=33) 
  * Kill the boss at stage three with the pistol (Total time 33+1=34) 



Note that here, we do not finish at level n, but when all the bosses are killed.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
