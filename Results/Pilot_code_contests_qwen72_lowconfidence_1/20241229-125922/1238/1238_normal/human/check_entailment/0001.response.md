Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to handle all the requirements and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the minimum time required to finish the game by considering the costs of using different guns and the costs of moving between levels. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: The program reads the input values and initializes necessary variables. It handles the input in a way that is compatible with both standard Python and PyPy.

2. **Cost Calculation**: For each level, it calculates the cost of using different strategies:
   - `indcost`: Cost of using the AWP to kill the boss and the pistol to kill all normal monsters.
   - `aoecost`: Cost of using the laser gun to deal 1 HP to all monsters and the pistol to finish off the boss.
   - `mincost`: Minimum cost between the above two strategies.
   - `mincost2l`: Adjusted cost if the player moves to the next level after using the laser gun.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum time to complete the game up to the current level. It maintains two states:
   - `c1`: Minimum time if the player is currently at the current level.
   - `c2`: Minimum time if the player is currently at the next level.

4. **Transition Between Levels**: The program correctly updates the states for moving to the next level and considers the costs of moving and the different strategies.

5. **Final Calculation**: After processing all levels, it calculates the minimum time required to finish the game by considering the final state.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and it correctly computes the minimum time required to kill all the bosses in all levels. Therefore, the program is correct.
