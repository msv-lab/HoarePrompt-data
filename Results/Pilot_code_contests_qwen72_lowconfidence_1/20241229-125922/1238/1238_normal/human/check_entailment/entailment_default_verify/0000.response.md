Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The program indeed has a logical issue that affects its correctness, specifically in how it handles the calculation of `c3` and `c4` for the last level. The provided example input and output clearly demonstrate that the program produces an incorrect result for the last level, leading to an incorrect final answer. The output hints confirm that the function processes the inputs as described, but the logic flaw in handling the last level causes the program to fail in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
