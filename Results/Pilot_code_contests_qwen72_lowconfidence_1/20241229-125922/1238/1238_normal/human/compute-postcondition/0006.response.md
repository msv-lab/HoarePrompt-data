The code `str1 = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line from `sys.stdin` (which is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`), splits the line by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to `str1`.

- `str1` now holds a list of strings, each representing a token from the input line.
- The input line is read and processed, so the state of `sys.stdin` changes, but this change is not directly observable in the given variables.

All other variables (`n`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3`, `d`, `a`) remain unchanged, as well as the conditions related to the interpreter and the setup of `sys.stdout` and `sys.stdin`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters.**
