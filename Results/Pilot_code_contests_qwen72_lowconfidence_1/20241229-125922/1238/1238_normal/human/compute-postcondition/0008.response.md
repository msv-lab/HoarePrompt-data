The code snippet `str2 = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, assigning this list to `str2`.

- `str2` is now a list of strings, each element being a substring from the input line, split by spaces.
- The values of `n`, `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, `d`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3`, `a`, `str1`, `sys.stdout`, `sys.stdin`, and the function registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the first integer from `str1`, `r1` is the second integer from `str1`, `r2` is the third integer from `str1`, `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`, `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters, `str2` is a list of strings split from the input line read by `raw_input()`**.
