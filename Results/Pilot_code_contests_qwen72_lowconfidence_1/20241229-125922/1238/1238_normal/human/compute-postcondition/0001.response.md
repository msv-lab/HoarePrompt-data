The code snippet changes the standard output stream (`sys.stdout`) to an instance of `io.BytesIO()`. This means that any subsequent print statements or writes to `sys.stdout` will be directed to this in-memory binary stream instead of the console.

- `sys.stdout` is now set to an instance of `io.BytesIO()`.
- The values of `n`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`**.
