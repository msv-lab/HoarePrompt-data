To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is the first integer from `str1` and must be greater than 0.
- `r1` is the second integer from `str1`.
- `r2` is the third integer from `str1`.
- `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`.
- `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`.
- `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where \(1 \leq r_1 \leq r_2 \leq r_3 \leq 10^9\).
- `d` is an integer where \(1 \leq d \leq 10^9\).
- `a` is a map object containing integers converted from the elements of `str2`.
- `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line.
- `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, and a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination.
- `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`.
- `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters.
- `str2` is a list of strings split from the input line read by `raw_input()`.
- `fs` is 0.
- `c1` is `c3`.
- `c2` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`.
- `i` is 0.
- `indcost` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`.
- `aoecost` is `min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))`.
- `mincost` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`.
- `mincost2l` is `min((r3 + a[0] * r1) - d, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`.
- `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`.
- `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
- `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
- `tto` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Identify the Impact of the Code:**
   - The code snippet provided (`c2 = c4`) does not affect the loop condition directly.
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `n`.

2. **Check the Previous Values of the Affected Variables:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from `str1` and must be greater than 0.

3. **Calculate the Result:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

### Output State:
- The value of `i` is incremented to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is the first integer from `str1` and must be greater than 0, `r1` is the second integer from `str1`, `r2` is the third integer from `str1`, `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`, `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a map object containing integers converted from the elements of `str2`, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters, `str2` is a list of strings split from the input line read by `raw_input()`, `fs` is 0, `c1` is `c3`, `c2` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`, `i` is 1, `indcost` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `aoecost` is `min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))`, `mincost` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `mincost2l` is `min((r3 + a[0] * r1) - d, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`, `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`, `tto` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`. If `i < n - 1`, then `c3` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, 2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))) + d`, and `c4` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to or greater than `n - 1`, then `c3` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1 + d, 2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1 - d, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + d)`, and `c4` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`.**
