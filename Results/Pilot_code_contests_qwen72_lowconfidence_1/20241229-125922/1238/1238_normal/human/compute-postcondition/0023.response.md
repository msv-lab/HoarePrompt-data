To calculate the new value of `c3`, we need to evaluate the expressions `c1 + oto` and `c2 + tto`, and then take the minimum of these two values, adding `d` to the result.

Given:
- `c1` is 0
- `c2` is 2 * d
- `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`
- `tto` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`

Let's evaluate the expressions:

1. `c1 + oto`:
   - `c1` is 0
   - `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`
   - Therefore, `c1 + oto` is `0 + (r3 + a[0] * r1)` which simplifies to `r3 + a[0] * r1`

2. `c2 + tto`:
   - `c2` is 2 * d
   - `tto` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`
   - Therefore, `c2 + tto` is `2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`

Now, we need to find the minimum of these two values:
- `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, 2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))))`

Finally, we add `d` to the result:
- `c3 = min(r3 + a[0] * r1, 2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))) + d`

Therefore, the updated state is:
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `str1` and must be greater than 0, `r1` is the second integer from `str1`, `r2` is the third integer from `str1`, `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`, `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a map object containing integers converted from the elements of `str2`, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters, `str2` is a list of strings split from the input line read by `raw_input()`, `fs` is 0, `c1` is 0, `c2` is 2 * d, `i` is 0, `indcost` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `aoecost` is `min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))`, `mincost` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `mincost2l` is `min((r3 + a[0] * r1) - d, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`, `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`, `tto` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `c3` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, 2 * d + min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))) + d`**
