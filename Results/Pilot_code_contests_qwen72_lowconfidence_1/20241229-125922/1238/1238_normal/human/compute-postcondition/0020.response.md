The code snippet assigns the value of `mincost + 2 * d` to the variable `ttt`. To determine the new value of `ttt`, we need to look at the current value of `mincost` and `d`.

From the initial state:
- `mincost` is defined as `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`
- `d` is an integer where `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9`

Therefore, the new value of `ttt` is calculated as:
- `ttt = mincost + 2 * d`

Since `mincost` is already defined in terms of `r3`, `a[0]`, `r1`, `r2`, and `r1`, and `d` is known, the new value of `ttt` is:
- `ttt = min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `str1` and must be greater than 0, `r1` is the second integer from `str1`, `r2` is the third integer from `str1`, `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`, `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a map object containing integers converted from the elements of `str2`, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters, `str2` is a list of strings split from the input line read by `raw_input()`, `fs` is 0, `c1` is 0, `c2` is 2 * d, `i` is 0, `indcost` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `aoecost` is `min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))`, `mincost` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `mincost2l` is `min((r3 + a[0] * r1) - d, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`, `oto` is `r3 + a[0] * r1`, `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`, `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`**
