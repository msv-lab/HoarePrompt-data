The provided code updates the value of `indcost` to `r3 + a[i] * r1`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `indcost` will be updated to `r3 + a[2] * r1`.

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Identify the Impact**: The code snippet updates the value of `indcost`.
2. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `r3` remains the same.
   - `a` is a map object containing integers converted from the elements of `str2`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `r1` remains the same.
3. **Calculate the Result**:
   - `indcost` is updated to `r3 + a[2] * r1`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
