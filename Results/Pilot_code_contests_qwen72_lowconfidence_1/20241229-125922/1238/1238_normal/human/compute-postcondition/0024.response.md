The code snippet `c4 = min(c1 + ott, c2 + ttt) + d` involves calculating the minimum cost between two expressions and adding `d` to the result. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `c1` is 0
   - `c2` is `2 * d`
   - `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`
   - `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`
   - `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`

2. **Calculations**:
   - `c1 + ott` is `0 + ott` which simplifies to `ott`.
   - `c2 + ttt` is `2 * d + ttt`.

3. **Finding the Minimum**:
   - `min(c1 + ott, c2 + ttt)` is `min(ott, 2 * d + ttt)`.
   - Since `ott` and `ttt` are the same, this simplifies to `min(ott, 2 * d + ott)`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - `c4` is `min(ott, 2 * d + ott) + d`.
   - This further simplifies to `ott + d` because `ott` is always less than or equal to `2 * d + ott`.

5. **Substitute `ott`**:
   - `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
   - Therefore, `c4` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d + d`.
   - Simplifying, `c4` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`.

Thus, the updated state is:
