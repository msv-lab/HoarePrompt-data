The given code snippet is:
```
c4 = min(c1 + ott, c2 + ttt) + d
```

Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Variables Involved**:
   - `c1` is 0.
   - `c2` is `2 * d`.
   - `ott` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
   - `ttt` is `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
   - `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.

2. **Calculations**:
   - `c1 + ott`:
     - Since `c1` is 0, this simplifies to `ott`.
   - `c2 + ttt`:
     - Since `c2` is `2 * d`, this becomes `2 * d + ttt`.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - `c4` is assigned the value of `min(c1 + ott, c2 + ttt) + d`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `c4 = min(ott, 2 * d + ttt) + d`.
   - Since `ott` and `ttt` are the same (`min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`), the minimum of `ott` and `2 * d + ttt` will be `ott`.
   - Therefore, `c4 = ott + d`.

4. **Substitute `ott`**:
   - `ott = min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d`.
   - So, `c4 = (min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 2 * d) + d`.
   - Simplifying, `c4 = min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))) + 3 * d`.

Therefore, the output state is:
