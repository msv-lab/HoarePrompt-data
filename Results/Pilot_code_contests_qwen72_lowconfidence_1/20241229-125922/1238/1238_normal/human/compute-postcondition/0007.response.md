The code `n, r1, r2, r3, d = map(int, str1)` takes the list of strings `str1` and converts each element to an integer, then assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `r1`, `r2`, `r3`, and `d` respectively. 

- `n` is assigned the first integer from `str1`.
- `r1` is assigned the second integer from `str1`.
- `r2` is assigned the third integer from `str1`.
- `r3` is assigned the fourth integer from `str1`.
- `d` is assigned the fifth integer from `str1`.

The list `str1` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from `str1`, `r1` is the second integer from `str1`, `r2` is the third integer from `str1`, `r3` is the fourth integer from `str1`, `d` is the fifth integer from `str1`, `r_1`, `r_2`, `r_3` are integers where 1 ≤ r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ r_3 ≤ 10^9, `d` is an integer where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `str1` is a list of strings split from the input line, `sys.stdout` is an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, a function is registered to write the content of `sys.stdout` to `sys.__stdout__` upon normal termination, `sys.stdin` is an instance of `io.BytesIO` initialized with the content of the original `sys.stdin`, and `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and returns it stripped of trailing newline characters.**
