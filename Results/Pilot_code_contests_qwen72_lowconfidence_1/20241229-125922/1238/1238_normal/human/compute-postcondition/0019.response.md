The code snippet `ott = mincost + 2 * d` calculates the value of `ott` by adding `2 * d` to the value of `mincost`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `ott` is assigned the value of `mincost + 2 * d`.
- The value of `mincost` is already known to be `min(r3 + a[0] * r1, min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2)))`.
- The value of `d` is an integer where `1 ≤ d ≤ 10^9`.

Therefore, the value of `ott` is calculated as:
\[ \text{ott} = \text{mincost} + 2 \times d \]

Since `mincost` is the minimum value among the expressions `r3 + a[0] * r1` and `min(r2 + r1, r1 * (a[0] + 2))`, the value of `ott` will be:
\[ \text{ott} = \min(\text{r3} + \text{a}[0] \times \text{r1}, \min(\text{r2} + \text{r1}, \text{r1} \times (\text{a}[0] + 2))) + 2 \times d \]

All other variables remain unchanged.
