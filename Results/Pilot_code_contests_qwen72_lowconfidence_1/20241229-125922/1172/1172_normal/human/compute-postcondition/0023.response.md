To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the changes it makes to the variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
- `i` is \(n - 1\).
- `solved` is `False`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
        x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs `n - 1` times, with `j` ranging from 0 to `n - 2`.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `x[j + 1]` is greater than `x[j]`.
   - If the condition is true, `x[j + 1]` is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`.

2. **Effect on `x`**:
   - The loop modifies the elements of `x` based on the condition `x[j + 1] > x[j]`.
   - After each iteration, the difference between consecutive elements is stored in the next element if the condition is met.

3. **Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `x` is modified based on the loop's condition.
   - `i` remains `n - 1` as it is not altered within the loop.
   - `solved` remains `False` as it is not altered within the loop.

4. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `x` will have been modified such that each element `x[j + 1]` (for `j` from 0 to `n - 2`) is either unchanged or reduced by the value of `x[j]` if `x[j + 1]` was initially greater than `x[j]`.
   - The final state of `x` will reflect these changes, but the exact values depend on the initial values of `x`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a modified list of integers where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `j` from 0 to `n - 2`) is either unchanged or reduced by `x[j]` if `x[j + 1]` was initially greater than `x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`.**
