The code snippet updates the value of `x[j + 1]` by subtracting `x[j]` from its current value. Let's break down the changes:

- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` remains a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `j` remains `n - 3`.
- `solved` remains `False`.

The specific change is in the value of `x[j + 1]`. Since `j` is `n - 3`, `j + 1` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `x[n - 2]` is updated to `x[n - 2] - x[n - 3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, `solved` is `False`, `x[n - 2]` is `x[n - 2] - x[n - 3]`**
