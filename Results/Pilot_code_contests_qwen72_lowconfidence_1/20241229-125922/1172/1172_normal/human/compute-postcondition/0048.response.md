To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 2`.
   - `solved` is `False`.
   - If `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, the element at index `j + 1` in `x` is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` (a non-negative value since `x[j + 1] > x[j]`), and the element at index `j` in `x` remains the same.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be decremented by 1, so the new value of `j` should be `n - 3`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `j` should be updated to `n - 3`.
   - The other states (`n`, `x`, `i`, and `solved`) remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the loop increment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `solved` is `False`.**
