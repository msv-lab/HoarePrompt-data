The value of `x[i]` is updated to be the integer conversion of its current value. Since `i` is 2, `x[2]` (the third element in the list `x`) is converted from a string representing a positive integer to an actual integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the third element is now an integer, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the third element is now an integer, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 2**
