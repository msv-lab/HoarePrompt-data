The `break` statement causes the program to exit the loop immediately. However, since no loop is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, it's implied that the `break` is part of a larger context (such as being inside a loop or conditional statement). The `break` does not affect the values of the variables directly but indicates that the loop or conditional structure it is part of is exited.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `solved`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or conditional structure is exited.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True` because all elements in `x` are equal, `j` is the index of the last element checked before the loop terminated (which could be less than `n - 2` if the loop broke early), and the loop or conditional structure is exited.**
