Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `x[j + 1]` is not equal to `x[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues with the next iteration where `x[j + 1]` must be equal to `x[j]`.***
