The code `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `x` but does not change its length or the values of `n` or `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `len(x) = n`, `i` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `len(x) = n`, `i` is `n - 1`**
