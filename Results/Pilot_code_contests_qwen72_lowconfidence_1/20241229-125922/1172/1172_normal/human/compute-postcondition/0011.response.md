For the given task, the `while` loop is set to `while True:` which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the program state. Since the loop condition is always true, no adjustments to the program state are necessary to ensure the first iteration of the loop can proceed.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `len(x) = n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`**
