Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True`, `j` is 0, for each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`. The current value of `x[j + 1]` is different from `x[j]`.**
