To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `x` is a modified list of integers where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `j` from 0 to `n - 2`) is either unchanged or reduced by `x[j]` if `x[j + 1]` was initially greater than `x[j]`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `solved` is `True`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in xrange(n - 1)` will iterate `n - 1` times. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
2. **Initial State of `j`**: The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `n - 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n` must be greater than 1**: Since `n - 1` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), this condition is already satisfied.
- **Initial Value of `j`**: The initial value of `j` should be 0.
- **Initial Value of `x`**: The list `x` must have at least `n` elements, as the loop iterates `n - 1` times, and each iteration accesses `x[j + 1]`.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) (no change needed as it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute).
- `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is `n - 1` (no change needed as it does not affect the loop).
- `solved` is `True` (no change needed as it does not affect the loop).
- `j` is 0 (initial value for the loop).

### State:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `True`, `j` is 0**
