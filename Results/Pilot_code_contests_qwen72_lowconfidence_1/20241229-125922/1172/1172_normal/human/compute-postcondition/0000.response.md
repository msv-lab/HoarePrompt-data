The code snippet `n = int(raw_input())` reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns this value to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `x1, x2, ..., xn` are positive integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100. After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to the new input value, which should also satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The values of `x1, x2, ..., xn` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and x1, x2, ..., xn are positive integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.**
