Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0, and the second element of `x` (i.e., `x[j + 1]`) is greater than the first element of `x` (i.e., `x[j]`).***
