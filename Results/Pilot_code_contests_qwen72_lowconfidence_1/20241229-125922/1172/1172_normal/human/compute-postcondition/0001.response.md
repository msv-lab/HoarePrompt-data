The code snippet `x = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. The list is then assigned to the variable `x`. Since `n` is an input integer indicating the number of elements expected in the list, and each `xi` is a positive integer, the input should be a space-separated sequence of positive integers.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `x1, x2, ..., xn` are positive integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100

After executing the code snippet, the variable `x` will contain a list of strings, each representing one of the integers `x1, x2, ..., xn`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list of strings representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.**
