The value of `solved` is updated from `False` to `True`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a modified list of integers where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `j` from 0 to `n - 2`) is either unchanged or reduced by `x[j]` if `x[j + 1]` was initially greater than `x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `True`.**
