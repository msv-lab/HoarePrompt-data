Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements. For each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`), if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, it is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`. After the loop, if all elements in `x` are equal, `solved` is `True` and `j` is `n - 2`. If any two consecutive elements `x[j + 1]` and `x[j]` are not equal, `solved` is `False` and `j` is the index where the inequality was found.**
