The code `x[i] = int(x[i])` converts the first element of the list `x` from a string to an integer. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so this operation affects the first element of the list `x`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is now an integer and the rest are strings representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 0**
