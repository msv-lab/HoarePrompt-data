The code snippet updates the value of `x[j + 1]` by subtracting the value of `x[j]` from it. Given that `j` is 2, this means `x[3]` is updated to `x[3] - x[2]`.

- `n` remains an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `solved` remains `False`.
- `j` remains 2.
- If `x[2] > x[1]`, then `x[2]` was previously updated to `x[2] - x[1]`. However, the current code snippet updates `x[3]` to `x[3] - x[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 2, `x[3]` is `x[3] - x[2]`**.
