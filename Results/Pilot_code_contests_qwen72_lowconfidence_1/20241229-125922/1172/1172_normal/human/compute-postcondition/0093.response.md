The code snippet `solved = False` explicitly sets the variable `solved` to `False`. Since `solved` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is `j + 1`**
