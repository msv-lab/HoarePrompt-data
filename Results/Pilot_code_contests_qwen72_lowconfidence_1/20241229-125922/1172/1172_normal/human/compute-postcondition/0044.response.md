To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `n - 2`
- `solved` is `False`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). This means the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

2. **Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as `n - 2`. However, this value is not relevant to the loop's execution because the loop will reassign `j` starting from 0.

3. **List `x`**: The list `x` must have at least `n` elements for the loop to be meaningful. This condition is already satisfied according to the given state.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `i` and `solved` do not affect the loop's execution directly. They might be used within the loop body, but they are not relevant to the loop's initialization.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the only condition that needs to be ensured is that `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 100, this condition is always met. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `solved` is `False`**
