The code snippet `print(x[0] * n)` performs the following actions:

- It multiplies the first element of the list `x` by the integer `n`.
- It prints the result of this multiplication.

Since `x` is a sorted list of integers with all elements being equal, `x[0]` represents the common value of all elements in `x`. Therefore, the output will be the product of this common value and `n`.

The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `i`, `solved`, and `j` are not altered by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with all elements being equal, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `True`, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completed without breaking early. If the loop broke early due to finding unequal elements, `j` is the index of the last element checked. The value `x[0] * n` is printed.**
