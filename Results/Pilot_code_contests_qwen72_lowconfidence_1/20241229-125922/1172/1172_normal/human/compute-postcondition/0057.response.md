Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`) is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and `solved` is `True`. The current value of `x[j + 1]` is not equal to `x[j]`.***
