Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True` if all elements in `x` are equal; otherwise, `solved` is `False` and `j` is the index of the last element checked before the loop terminated (which could be less than `n - 2` if the loop broke early). For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.**
