To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
   - For each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`), if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, it is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`.
   - If `x[j + 1] != x[j]` for any `j`, `solved` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and `solved` remains `True`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - All other conditions remain the same as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `solved` remains `True`**.
