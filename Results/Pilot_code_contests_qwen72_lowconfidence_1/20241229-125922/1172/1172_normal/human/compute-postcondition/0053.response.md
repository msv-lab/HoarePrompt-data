Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `solved` is `False`. If `x[n - 1]` is greater than `x[n - 2]`, then `x[n - 1]` is updated to the difference between `x[n - 1]` and `x[n - 2]`.***
