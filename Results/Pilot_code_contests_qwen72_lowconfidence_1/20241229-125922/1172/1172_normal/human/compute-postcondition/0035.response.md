The value of `solved` is set to `False`. This overrides the initial condition that `solved` is `True` unless `x[3] != x[2]`, in which case `solved` is `False` and the loop breaks. Since `solved` is explicitly set to `False`, the loop breaking condition no longer applies. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 2, `solved` is `False`**
