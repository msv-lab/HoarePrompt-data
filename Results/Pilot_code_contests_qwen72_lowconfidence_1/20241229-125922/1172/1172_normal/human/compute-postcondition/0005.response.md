The code snippet `x[i] = int(x[i])` converts the second element (index 1) of the list `x` from a string to an integer.

- `n` remains an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, and the rest are strings representing positive integers. After executing the code, the second element (at index 1) of the list `x` is converted to an integer.
- `len(x)` remains equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1, and it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the rest are strings representing the positive integers `x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 1**.
