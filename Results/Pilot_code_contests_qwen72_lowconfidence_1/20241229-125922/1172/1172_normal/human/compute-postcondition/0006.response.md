To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, and the rest are strings representing positive integers.
- After executing the code, the second element (at index 1) of the list `x` is converted to an integer.
- `len(x)` remains equal to `n`.
- `i` is 1, and it remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in xrange(len(x)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(x)`. Since `len(x) = n`, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the rest are strings representing positive integers.
   - `len(x) = n`.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The loop will check if `i < n` to decide whether to execute the next iteration.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The list `x` will remain the same, but the third element (index 2) will be converted to an integer in the next iteration.

### Output State:
The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the third element is a string representing a positive integer.
- `len(x) = n`.
- `i` is 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is an integer, the second element is an integer, and the third element is a string representing a positive integer, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 2**.
