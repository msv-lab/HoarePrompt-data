The value of `solved` is set to `False`. Since `solved` was already `False` in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `x[j + 1]` must be equal to `x[j]` for the next iteration.**
