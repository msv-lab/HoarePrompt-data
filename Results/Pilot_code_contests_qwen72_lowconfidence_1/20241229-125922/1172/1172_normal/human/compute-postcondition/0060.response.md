Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements. For each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`), if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, it is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`. If `x[j + 1] != x[j]` for any `j`, `solved` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and `solved` remains `True`.***
