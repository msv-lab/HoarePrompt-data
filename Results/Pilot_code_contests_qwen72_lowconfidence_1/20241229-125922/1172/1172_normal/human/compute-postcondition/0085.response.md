Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is `n - 2`. For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, if `x[i + 1]` was originally greater than `x[i]`, then `x[i + 1]` is updated to `x[i + 1] - x[i]`. The final state of `x` is such that for each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.**
