To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and its impact on the variables `x`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `solved`.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `n - 2`.
- `solved` is `False`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
        x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n - 2` (inclusive), meaning it runs `n - 1` times.
   - For each iteration, the loop checks if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`. If true, it updates `x[j + 1]` to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`.

2. **Impact on `x`**:
   - After each iteration, if the condition `x[j + 1] > x[j]` is true, `x[j + 1]` is reduced by `x[j]`.
   - This process continues for each pair of adjacent elements in the list `x` from the start to the second-to-last element.

3. **Final State of `x`**:
   - After all iterations, `x` will have been modified such that for each pair of adjacent elements `x[j]` and `x[j + 1]` (where `0 <= j < n - 1`), if `x[j + 1]` was initially greater than `x[j]`, `x[j + 1]` will be reduced by `x[j]`.
   - The final list `x` will still be sorted, but the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains `n - 1`.
   - `j` will be `n - 2` after the last iteration.
   - `solved` remains `False` (as it is not modified in the loop).

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`) is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `solved` is `False`.**
