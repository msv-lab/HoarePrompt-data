The code snippet provided sets the variable `solved` to `True`. This action changes the state of `solved` from its initial value of `False` to `True`. No other variables are directly modified by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True`, `j` is `n - 2`. For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.**
