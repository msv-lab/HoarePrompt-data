The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints, it should accept a list or tuple of positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where each `xi` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100], and the total number of integers `n` is within the range [2, 100]. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so I cannot provide a description of what the function returns without additional information. However, based on the given context, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list or tuple of positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where each `xi` is within the range [1, 100] and the total number of integers `n` is within the range [2, 100]. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
