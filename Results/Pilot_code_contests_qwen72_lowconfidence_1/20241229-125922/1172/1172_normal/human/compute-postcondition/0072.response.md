Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements. If all elements in `x` are equal, `solved` is `True` and `j` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if any two consecutive elements `x[j + 1]` and `x[j]` are not equal, `solved` is `False` and `j` is the index where the inequality was found.***
