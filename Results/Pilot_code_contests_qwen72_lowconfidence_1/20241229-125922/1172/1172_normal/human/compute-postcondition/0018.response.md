The code snippet updates the value of `x[j + 1]` by subtracting `x[j]` from it. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so the code effectively changes `x[2]` to `x[2] - x[1]`.

Since `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `x[2] > x[1]` (as per the condition in the initial state), the subtraction will result in a non-negative value. The updated value of `x[2]` will be `x[2] - x[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 1, `x[2]` is `x[2] - x[1]`.**
