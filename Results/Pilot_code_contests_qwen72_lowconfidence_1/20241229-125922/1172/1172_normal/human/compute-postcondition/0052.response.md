The code snippet modifies the element at index `j + 1` in the list `x` by subtracting the element at index `j` from it. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `j` is `n - 2`
- `solved` is `False`

The element at index `j + 1` (which is `n - 1`) is updated to be the difference between the element at index `n - 1` and the element at index `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `solved` is `False`, `x[n - 1]` is `x[n - 1] - x[n - 2]`**
