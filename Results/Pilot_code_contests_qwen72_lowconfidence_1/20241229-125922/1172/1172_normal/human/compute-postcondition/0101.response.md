Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True` because all elements in `x` are equal, and `j` is the index of the last element checked before the loop terminated (which could be less than `n - 2` if the loop broke early). For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is equal to `x[i]`.***
