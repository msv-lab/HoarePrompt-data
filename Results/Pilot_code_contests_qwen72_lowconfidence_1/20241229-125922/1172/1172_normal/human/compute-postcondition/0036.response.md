The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop) or from the nearest enclosing conditional block (like an `if` statement). Since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we assume the `break` is part of a larger context not shown here.

Given that the `break` statement is executed, it will terminate the execution of the nearest enclosing loop or condition, but it does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `i`, `j`, and `solved` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 2, `solved` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
