Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`. If `x[3] > x[2]`, then `x[3]` is updated to `x[3] - x[2]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged. `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, and `j` is 2.***
