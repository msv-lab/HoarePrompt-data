To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements
- `solved` is `False`
- `j` is the index where the inequality was found (or any index less than `n - 2`)

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. Since \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `n - 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and iterates up to `n - 2`.
3. **List `x`**: The list `x` must have at least `n` elements for the loop to be meaningful. This condition is already satisfied.
4. **Variable `solved`**: The value of `solved` (`False`) does not affect the loop's execution directly but might be relevant within the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) (no change needed as this ensures the loop will execute).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements (no change needed as this is already satisfied).
- `solved` is `False` (no change needed as it does not affect the loop's execution directly).
- `j` is the loop variable and will start from 0 (initial state for the loop).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0**
