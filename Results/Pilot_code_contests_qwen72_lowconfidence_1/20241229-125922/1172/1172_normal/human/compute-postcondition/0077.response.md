The code snippet updates the second element of the list `x` by subtracting the first element from it. The initial conditions specify that `x[j + 1]` is greater than `x[j]`, which ensures that the new value of `x[j + 1]` will be non-negative.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements
- `solved` is `False`
- `j` is 0
- `x[j + 1]` is greater than `x[j]`

After executing the code:
- `x[j + 1]` is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`
- The rest of the variables remain unchanged

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0, `x[j + 1]` is now `x[1] - x[0]` (which is a non-negative integer).**
