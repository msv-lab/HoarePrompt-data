The code sets the variable `solved` to `False`. This changes the initial state where `solved` was `True` to `False`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1, `solved` is `False`**
