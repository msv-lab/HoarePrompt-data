Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is 1. If `x[j + 1]` is not equal to `x[j]`, `solved` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `solved` remains `True`.***
