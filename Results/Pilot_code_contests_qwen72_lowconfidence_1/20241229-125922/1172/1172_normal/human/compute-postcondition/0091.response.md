Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True` if `x[j + 1]` is equal to `x[j]`; otherwise, `solved` is `False` and `j` remains 0. For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`. If `x[j + 1]` is different from `x[j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
