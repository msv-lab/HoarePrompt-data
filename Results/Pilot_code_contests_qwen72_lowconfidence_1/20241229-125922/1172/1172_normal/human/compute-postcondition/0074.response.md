The code snippet `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. Since `x` is already described as a sorted list of integers, this operation does not change the order of elements in `x`. The other variables (`n`, `solved`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, and `j` is the index where the inequality was found (or any index less than `n - 2`)**
