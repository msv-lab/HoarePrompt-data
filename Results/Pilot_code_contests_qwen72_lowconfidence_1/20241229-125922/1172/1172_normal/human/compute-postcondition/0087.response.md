To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `solved` is `True`.
- `j` is `n - 2`.
- For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 2.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: Before the loop starts, `j` should be 0. However, the given state mentions `j` is `n - 2`. This needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to start correctly.
3. **List `x`**: The list `x` must have at least `n` elements, and it should be sorted as described.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements.
- `solved` is `True`.
- `j` is 0 (not `n - 2`).
- For each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `True`, `j` is 0, for each `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, `x[i + 1]` is either equal to `x[i]` or has been adjusted to a non-negative integer based on the original difference between `x[i + 1]` and `x[i]`.**
