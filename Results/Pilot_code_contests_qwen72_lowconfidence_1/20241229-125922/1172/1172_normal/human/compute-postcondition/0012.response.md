The code snippet `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in place in ascending order. Since `x` is already stated to be a sorted list of integers in ascending order, this operation does not change the list `x`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `solved`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`**
