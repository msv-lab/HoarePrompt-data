Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`. If all consecutive elements in `x` are equal, `solved` is `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if any two consecutive elements in `x` are not equal, `solved` is `False`.***
