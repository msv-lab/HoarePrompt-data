The code snippet modifies the second element of the list `x` by subtracting the first element from it. Let's go through the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `solved` is `False`
   - `j` is 0
   - `x[j + 1]` (i.e., `x[1]`) is greater than `x[j]` (i.e., `x[0]`)

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]` is executed.
   - This means `x[1]` is updated to `x[1] - x[0]`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `x[1]` is now `x[1] - x[0]`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Final State**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `x` is a list of integers with a length of at least `n`, and `x[1]` is now `x[1] - x[0]`
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `solved` is `False`
   - `j` is 0
   - `x[1]` is now `x[1] - x[0]`, which is a non-negative value since `x` was initially sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list of integers with a length of at least `n`, `x[1]` is now `x[1] - x[0]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0**.
