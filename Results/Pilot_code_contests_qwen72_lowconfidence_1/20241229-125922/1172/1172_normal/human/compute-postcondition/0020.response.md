To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `solved` is `False`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `x[2] > x[1]`, then `x[2]` is updated to `x[2] - x[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in xrange(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j < n - 1`. Since `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `solved` is `False`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - If `x[2] > x[1]`, then `x[2]` is updated to `x[2] - x[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 2, if `x[2] > x[1]`, then `x[2]` is updated to `x[2] - x[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.**
