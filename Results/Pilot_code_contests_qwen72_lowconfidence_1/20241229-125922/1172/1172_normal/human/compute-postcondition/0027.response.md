The code snippet sets `solved` to `False`. This changes the value of `solved` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0, and the second element of `x` is not equal to the first element of `x`.**
