Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 0. If `x[j + 1]` is greater than `x[j]`, then `x[j + 1]` is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` (which is a non-negative integer). Otherwise, the variables and list remain unchanged.***
