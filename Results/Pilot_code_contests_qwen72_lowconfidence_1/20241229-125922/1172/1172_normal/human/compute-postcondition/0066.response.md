The code snippet sets `solved` to `False`. According to the initial state, `solved` was only updated under specific conditions (`x[j + 1] != x[j]`). However, the code explicitly sets `solved` to `False`, overriding any previous conditions.

- `j` remains `j + 1`.
- `solved` is now `False`.
- `j` must still be less than `n - 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`j` is `j + 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` must be less than `n - 2`**.
