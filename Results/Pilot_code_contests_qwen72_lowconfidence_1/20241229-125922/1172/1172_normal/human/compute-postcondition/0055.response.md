The value of `solved` is changed from `False` to `True`. The values of `n`, `x`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`) is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `solved` is `True`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements where each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`) is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `solved` is `True`.**
