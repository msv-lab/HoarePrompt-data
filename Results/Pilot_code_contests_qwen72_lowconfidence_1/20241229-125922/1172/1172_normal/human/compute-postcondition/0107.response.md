Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers from the user, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and each integer `xi` satisfies `1 ≤ xi ≤ 100`. It then repeatedly adjusts the list until all elements are equal by subtracting the smaller element from the larger one in adjacent pairs. Once all elements are equal, it prints the product of the common value and `n`. The function ensures that the final list contains only identical elements, and the printed value represents the sum of these identical elements. **

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `n`: An integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
  - `x1, x2, ..., xn`: A list of `n` positive integers where each `xi` satisfies `1 ≤ xi ≤ 100`.

- **Output:**
  - The function prints the product of the common value of the elements in the list and `n`.

- **Function Behavior:**
  - The function reads `n` and the list of integers from the user.
  - It converts the list of strings into a list of integers.
  - It sorts the list and enters a loop where it repeatedly checks and adjusts the list until all elements are equal.
  - In each iteration, it sorts the list and then iterates through the list to reduce the difference between adjacent elements.
  - The loop continues until all elements in the list are equal.
  - Once the elements are equal, it prints the product of the common value and `n`.

- **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
  - **Edge Case 1:** If all elements in the list are already equal at the start, the loop will still run once and then terminate, printing the correct result.
  - **Edge Case 2:** If the input list contains very large differences between elements, the function will take more iterations to equalize the elements, but it will eventually do so.
  - **Missing Functionality:** The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values) gracefully. It assumes the input is always valid according to the specified constraints.

### Final State:
- **After the function concludes:**
  - `n` remains an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
  - `x` is a sorted list of integers where all elements are equal.
  - The function prints the product of the common value of the elements and `n`.
