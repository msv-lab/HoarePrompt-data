To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

- **Initial State**: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list of strings representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
- **Loop Statement**: `for i in xrange(len(x)):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop uses `xrange(len(x))`, which means the loop will iterate from `0` to `len(x) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `len(x)` must be greater than 0.

2. **Initial State Requirements**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `x` is a list of strings representing positive integers, and the length of `x` should be equal to `n`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 100, it ensures that `n` is at least 2.
   - `x` must be a list of strings with a length equal to `n` to ensure that `len(x)` is at least 2, making the loop execute.

4. **Initial State Adjustment**:
   - The initial state should reflect that `x` is a list of strings with a length equal to `n`, and `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `x` is a list of strings representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, and `len(x) = n`.
- `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list of strings representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `len(x) = n`, `i` is 0**
