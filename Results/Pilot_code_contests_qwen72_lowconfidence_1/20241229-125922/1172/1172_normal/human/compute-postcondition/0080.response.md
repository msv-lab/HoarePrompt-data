The value of `x[j + 1]` is updated to be the difference between the current value of `x[j + 1]` and `x[j]`. Since `j` is 1, this means `x[2]` is updated to `x[2] - x[1]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 1, `x[2]` is `x[2] - x[1]`**
