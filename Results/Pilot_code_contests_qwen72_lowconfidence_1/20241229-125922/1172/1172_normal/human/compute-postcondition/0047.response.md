Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `solved` is `False`. If `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, the element at index `j + 1` in `x` is updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]` (a non-negative value since `x[j + 1] > x[j]`), and the element at index `j` in `x` remains the same.***
