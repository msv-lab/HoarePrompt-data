The code snippet `x.sort()` sorts the list `x` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not change the length of the list `x`, nor does it affect the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, or `solved`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `solved` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `solved` is `False`**
