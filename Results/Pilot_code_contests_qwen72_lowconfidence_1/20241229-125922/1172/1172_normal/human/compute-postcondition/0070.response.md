Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements. For each element `x[j + 1]` (for `0 <= j < n - 1`), if `x[j + 1] > x[j]`, it was updated to `x[j + 1] - x[j]`. After the loop, all elements in `x` are equal, `solved` is `True`, and `j` is `n - 2`.***
