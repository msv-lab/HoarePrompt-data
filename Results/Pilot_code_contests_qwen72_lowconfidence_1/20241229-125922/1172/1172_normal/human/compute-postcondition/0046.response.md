The code `x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]` updates the element at index `j + 1` in the list `x` by subtracting the element at index `j` from it. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\),
- `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements,
- `i` is `n - 1`,
- `j` is `n - 2`,
- `solved` is `False`,
- the element at index `j + 1` in `x` is greater than the element at index `j` in `x`.

After executing the code, the element at index `j + 1` in `x` is updated to the difference between the original value at `j + 1` and the value at `j`. The new value at `j + 1` is `x[j + 1] - x[j]`.

Since the other variables and conditions remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `solved` is `False`, the element at index `j + 1` in `x` is `x[j + 1] - x[j]` (which is a non-negative value since `x[j + 1] > x[j]`), and the element at index `j` in `x` remains the same.**
