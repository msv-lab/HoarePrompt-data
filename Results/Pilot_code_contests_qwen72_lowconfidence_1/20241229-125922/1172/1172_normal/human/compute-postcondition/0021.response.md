The code snippet updates the value of `x[j + 1]` by subtracting `x[j]` from it. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `solved` is `False`.
- `j` is 2.
- If `x[2] > x[1]`, then `x[2]` is updated to `x[2] - x[1]`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

Given that `j` is 2, the code snippet `x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]` translates to `x[3] = x[3] - x[2]`.

Let's evaluate the impact:

- `x[3]` is updated to `x[3] - x[2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `x` (except for `x[3]`), `i`, `solved`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length of at least `n` and `x[3]` is updated to `x[3] - x[2]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `False`, `j` is 2.**
