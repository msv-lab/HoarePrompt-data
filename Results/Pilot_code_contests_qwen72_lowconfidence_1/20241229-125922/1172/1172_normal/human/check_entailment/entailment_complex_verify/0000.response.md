Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. The program does not always produce the correct minimal sum for the given problem description. The key issue is that the program assumes that once all elements in the array are equal, the minimal sum is achieved by multiplying the smallest element by the number of elements. However, this assumption is incorrect in some cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
Input:
4
1 3 4 7
```
The expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `12` because it sorts the array and repeatedly subtracts the smallest value from the others until they are all equal, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the final output is `1 * 4 = 4`.

However, the correct minimal sum is `4`, which can be achieved by the operations:
1. `7 - 4 = 3` → Array becomes `[1, 3, 4, 3]`
2. `4 - 3 = 1` → Array becomes `[1, 3, 1, 3]`
3. `3 - 1 = 2` → Array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
4. `2 - 1 = 1` → Array becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]`

The program's logic of repeatedly subtracting the smallest value from the larger values until all values are equal does not always lead to the minimal sum. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
