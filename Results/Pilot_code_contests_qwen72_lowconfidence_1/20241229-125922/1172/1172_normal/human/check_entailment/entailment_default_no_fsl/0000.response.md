Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The loop `while True:` could potentially run indefinitely if the condition for `solved` is never met. This can happen if the array `x` does not converge to a state where all elements are equal. For example, if the input is `[4, 6, 8]`, the code will not terminate because it will keep reducing the elements without ever making them all equal.

2. **Incorrect Termination Condition**: The termination condition `if solved:` checks if all elements in the array are equal. However, the problem description requires minimizing the sum of the elements, not necessarily making all elements equal. The code fails to ensure that the sum is minimized correctly.

3. **Example Failure**: Consider the input `3 2 4 6`. The correct output should be `6`, but the provided code will not produce this output. The code will reduce the elements to `[2, 2, 4]` and then terminate, resulting in an incorrect sum of `8`.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should focus on reducing the elements in a way that minimizes the sum, which typically involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements and then multiplying it by the number of elements. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the code that uses the GCD approach:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_sum = reduce(gcd, x) * n
    print(min_sum)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly handles all potential cases and ensures the minimal sum is achieved.
