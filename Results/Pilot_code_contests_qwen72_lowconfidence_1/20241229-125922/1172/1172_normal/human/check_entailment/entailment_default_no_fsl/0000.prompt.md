You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now. 

Ciel has n positive integers: x1, x2, ..., xn. She can do the following operation as many times as needed: select two different indexes i and j such that xi > xj hold, and then apply assignment xi = xi - xj. The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.

Please help Ciel to find this minimal sum.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then the second line contains n integers: x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100).

Output

Output a single integer — the required minimal sum.

Note

In the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment: x2 = x2 - x1.

In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is: x3 = x3 - x2, x2 = x2 - x1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in xrange(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
    x.sort()
    solved = False
    while True:
        x.sort()
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
                x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
        solved = True
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] != x[j]:
                solved = False
                break
        if solved:
            break
    print(x[0] * n)


```
Output hints: The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values) gracefully. It assumes the input is always valid according to the specified constraints.

### Final State:
-

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
