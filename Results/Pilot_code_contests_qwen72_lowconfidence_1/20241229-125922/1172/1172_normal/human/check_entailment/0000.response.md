Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input array contains multiple distinct values but the minimal sum achievable is not equal to `x[0] * n`. For instance, consider the input:

```
Input:
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program will output `6` because after sorting, it repeatedly subtracts the smallest value from the others until they are all equal, which results in `[1, 1, 1]`, and the final output is `1 * 3 = 3`.

But let's test another case to ensure the issue is clear:

```
Input:
4
1 3 4 7
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

The program will output `12` because it will sort the array and repeatedly subtract the smallest value from the others until they are all equal, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the final output is `1 * 4 = 4`.

However, the correct minimal sum is `4`, which can be achieved by the operations:
1. `7 - 4 = 3` → Array becomes `[1, 3, 4, 3]`
2. `4 - 3 = 1` → Array becomes `[1, 3, 1, 3]`
3. `3 - 1 = 2` → Array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
4. `2 - 1 = 1` → Array becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct minimal sum, and hence it is incorrect.
