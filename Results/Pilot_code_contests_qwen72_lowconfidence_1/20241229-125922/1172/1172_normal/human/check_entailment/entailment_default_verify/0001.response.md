### Analysis

**Problem Description:**
The problem requires minimizing the sum of a list of positive integers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until no further reductions can be made. The goal is to achieve the smallest possible sum of the numbers.

**Program:**
The provided program reads the input, sorts the list, and attempts to reduce the numbers by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one. However, it uses a simple loop to check if all numbers are equal, which is not sufficient to ensure the minimum possible sum.

**Original Assessment:**
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. A specific counterexample is provided where the program outputs `15` instead of the expected `5`.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints confirm that the program assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input gracefully. This is consistent with the problem description, which specifies valid input constraints.

### Evaluation

1. **Counterexample Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `5 1 2 3 4 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `5`
   - **Actual Output:** `15`
   - **Reason:** The program stops too early without ensuring that all numbers are reduced to their minimum possible values. The program only checks if all numbers are equal, which is not the correct condition to ensure the minimum sum.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program sorts the list and iterates through it, reducing the larger number by the smaller one.
   - It then checks if all numbers are equal to stop the loop.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the sum is minimized. The correct approach should continue reducing until no further reductions can be made, ensuring the smallest possible sum.

3. **Output Hints:**
   - The output hints confirm that the program assumes valid input, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program's correctness should be evaluated based on its ability to handle valid input correctly.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, as demonstrated by the counterexample. The program's logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Final Assessment
Final: **False**
