### Analysis

**Problem Description:**
- The goal is to minimize the sum of a list of positive integers by repeatedly selecting two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(x_i > x_j\) and applying \(x_i = x_i - x_j\).

**Program Behavior:**
- The program reads the number of integers \(n\) and the list of integers \(x\).
- It sorts the list and repeatedly subtracts the smallest value from the larger values until all values are equal.
- Finally, it prints the smallest value multiplied by \(n\).

**Original Assessment:**
- The program is marked as incorrect because it does not handle cases where the minimal sum is not equal to \(x[0] * n\).
- Specific examples were provided to demonstrate the incorrect behavior.

**Output Hints:**
- The function assumes valid input and does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values) gracefully.

### Evaluation

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `6` (because it results in `[1, 1, 1]` and outputs `1 * 3 = 3`)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4 1 3 4 7`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Program Output: `12` (because it results in `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and outputs `1 * 4 = 4`)

3. **General Case:**
   - The program's logic is flawed because it assumes that the minimal sum is always achieved when all elements are equal to the smallest element.
   - This assumption is incorrect, as demonstrated by the examples where the minimal sum is not \(x[0] * n\).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always produce the correct minimal sum, especially in cases where the minimal sum is not equal to \(x[0] * n\).

### Final Assessment
Final: **False**
