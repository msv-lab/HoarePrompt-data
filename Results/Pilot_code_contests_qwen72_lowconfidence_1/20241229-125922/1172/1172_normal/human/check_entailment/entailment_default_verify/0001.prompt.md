You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now. 

Ciel has n positive integers: x1, x2, ..., xn. She can do the following operation as many times as needed: select two different indexes i and j such that xi > xj hold, and then apply assignment xi = xi - xj. The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.

Please help Ciel to find this minimal sum.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then the second line contains n integers: x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100).

Output

Output a single integer — the required minimal sum.

Examples

45 12 27 30 18


Output

15

Note

In the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment: x2 = x2 - x1.

In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is: x3 = x3 - x2, x2 = x2 - x1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in xrange(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
    x.sort()
    solved = False
    while True:
        x.sort()
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
                x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
        solved = True
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] != x[j]:
                solved = False
                break
        if solved:
            break
    print(x[0] * n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is that the program may not always reach the minimum possible sum due to its approach to the reduction process. Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

The program outputs `15`, which is incorrect. The expected output is `5`, as the smallest number can be used to reduce all other numbers to their minimum possible values, resulting in all numbers being equal to `1`. The program fails to achieve this because it stops too early, without ensuring that all numbers are reduced to their minimum possible values.

This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values, out-of-range values) gracefully. It assumes the input is always valid according to the specified constraints.

### Final State:
-

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
