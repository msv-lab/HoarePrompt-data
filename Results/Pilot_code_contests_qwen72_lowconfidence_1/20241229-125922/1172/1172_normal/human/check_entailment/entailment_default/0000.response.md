Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not always produce the correct minimal sum as required by the problem description. Specifically, the code attempts to reduce the values in the list by repeatedly subtracting the smallest value from the larger ones until all values are equal. However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimal sum is achieved.

A counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  3
  3 5 8
  ```
- The correct minimal sum should be 9, which can be achieved by the following steps:
  - Subtract 3 from 5: [3, 2, 8]
  - Subtract 2 from 3: [1, 2, 8]
  - Subtract 1 from 2: [1, 1, 8]
  - Subtract 1 from 8: [1, 1, 7]
  - Subtract 1 from 7: [1, 1, 6]
  - Subtract 1 from 6: [1, 1, 5]
  - Subtract 1 from 5: [1, 1, 4]
  - Subtract 1 from 4: [1, 1, 3]
  - Subtract 1 from 3: [1, 1, 2]
  - Subtract 1 from 2: [1, 1, 1]
  - The final sum is 3 * 3 = 9.

However, the provided code will produce a different result:
- After sorting: [3, 5, 8]
- First iteration: [3, 2, 8] (subtract 3 from 5)
- Second iteration: [2, 2, 5] (subtract 3 from 8)
- Third iteration: [2, 2, 3] (subtract 2 from 5)
- Fourth iteration: [2, 2, 1] (subtract 2 from 3)
- Fifth iteration: [1, 1, 1] (subtract 1 from 2)

The final sum is 1 * 3 = 3, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
