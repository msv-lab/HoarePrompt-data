**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program uses a `while True:` loop which could potentially run indefinitely if the condition for `solved` is never met. This can happen if the algorithm gets stuck in a state where the elements are not equal but the operations do not lead to a uniform state.

2. **Incorrect Termination Condition**: The termination condition for the loop is when all elements in the list `x` are equal. However, this is not the correct condition for achieving the minimal sum. The correct condition should be when no further reduction can be made, i.e., when no pair `(xi, xj)` exists such that `xi > xj`.

3. **Suboptimal Reduction**: The program reduces the larger elements by the smallest element repeatedly, but it does not guarantee that the minimal sum is achieved. For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `x = [2, 4, 6]`. The program will reduce `x` to `[2, 2, 2]` and output `6`, which is correct. However, for more complex cases, this approach might not always yield the minimal sum.

### Example of Incorrect Output:

Consider the input:
```
n = 4
x = [4, 6, 8, 10]
```

- After sorting: `[4, 6, 8, 10]`
- First iteration: `[4, 2, 4, 6]` (after reducing `6` by `4`)
- Second iteration: `[2, 2, 2, 4]` (after reducing `4` by `2`)
- Third iteration: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (after reducing `4` by `2` again)

The program will output `8`, but the correct minimal sum is actually `6` (achieved by reducing `10` by `4` to get `[4, 6, 8, 6]`, then reducing `8` by `6` to get `[4, 6, 2, 6]`, and so on).

### Correct Approach:

To achieve the minimal sum, the program should repeatedly reduce the largest element by the smallest element until no further reduction is possible. The correct minimal sum is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements multiplied by the number of elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    gcd_value = x[0]
    for num in x:
        gcd_value = math.gcd(gcd_value, num)
    
    print(gcd_value * n)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimal sum by finding the GCD of all elements and multiplying it by the number of elements, which is the optimal solution for the problem.
