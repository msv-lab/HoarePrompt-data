You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Fox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now. 

Ciel has n positive integers: x1, x2, ..., xn. She can do the following operation as many times as needed: select two different indexes i and j such that xi > xj hold, and then apply assignment xi = xi - xj. The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.

Please help Ciel to find this minimal sum.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then the second line contains n integers: x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100).

Output

Output a single integer — the required minimal sum.

Examples

Input

2
1 2


Output

Input

12 18


Output

Input

5
45 12 27 30 18


Output

15

Note

In the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment: x2 = x2 - x1.

In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is: x3 = x3 - x2, x2 = x2 - x1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and x1, x2, ..., xn are positive integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in xrange(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where all elements are integers representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `len(x) = n`, `i` is `n - 1`.
    x.sort()
    solved = False
    while True:
        x.sort()
        
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
                x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
        
        solved = True
        
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] != x[j]:
                solved = False
                break
        
        if solved:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with all elements being equal, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `True`, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completed without breaking early. If the loop broke early due to finding unequal elements, `j` is the index of the last element checked.
    print(x[0] * n)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
