You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now. 

Ciel has n positive integers: x1, x2, ..., xn. She can do the following operation as many times as needed: select two different indexes i and j such that xi > xj hold, and then apply assignment xi = xi - xj. The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.

Please help Ciel to find this minimal sum.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then the second line contains n integers: x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100).

Output

Output a single integer — the required minimal sum.

Examples

Input

1 2

Input

5
45 12 27 30 18


Output

15

Note

In the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment: x2 = x2 - x1.

In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is: x3 = x3 - x2, x2 = x2 - x1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in xrange(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
    x.sort()
    solved = False
    while True:
        x.sort()
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
                x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
        solved = True
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] != x[j]:
                solved = False
                break
        if solved:
            break
    print(x[0] * n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is that the program may not always reach the minimum possible sum due to its approach to the reduction process. Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

The program outputs `15`, which is incorrect. The expected output is `5`, as the smallest number can be used to reduce all other numbers to their minimum possible values, resulting in all numbers being equal to `1`. The program fails to achieve this because it stops too early, without ensuring that all numbers are reduced to their minimum possible values.

This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and x1, x2, ..., xn are positive integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    for i in xrange(len(x)):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `x` is a list where all elements are integers representing the positive integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `len(x) = n`, `i` is `n - 1`.
    x.sort()
    solved = False
    while True:
        x.sort()
        
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] > x[j]:
                x[j + 1] = x[j + 1] - x[j]
        
        solved = True
        
        for j in xrange(n - 1):
            if x[j + 1] != x[j]:
                solved = False
                break
        
        if solved:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `x` is a sorted list of integers with all elements being equal, `i` is `n - 1`, `solved` is `True`, and `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completed without breaking early. If the loop broke early due to finding unequal elements, `j` is the index of the last element checked.
    print(x[0] * n)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
