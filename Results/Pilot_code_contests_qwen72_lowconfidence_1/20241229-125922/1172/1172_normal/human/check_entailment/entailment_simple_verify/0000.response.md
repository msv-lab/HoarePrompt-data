Based on the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate. Here's the detailed reasoning:

### Problem Description
The goal is to minimize the sum of the given integers using the allowed operations. The operations allow us to select two different indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(x_i > x_j\) and then perform \(x_i = x_i - x_j\). The aim is to achieve the smallest possible sum of the array.

### Original Program Analysis
The program reads the input, sorts the array, and then enters a loop where it repeatedly subtracts the smallest element from the larger elements until all elements are equal. Finally, it prints the product of the smallest element and the number of elements.

### Annotated Code Analysis
- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `x` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq x_i \leq 100\).
- **After Input Parsing**: `x` is converted to a list of integers.
- **Sorting and Loop**:
  - The array is sorted.
  - The loop continues until all elements in the array are equal.
  - Inside the loop, the program checks if \(x_{j+1} > x_j\) and performs the subtraction \(x_{j+1} = x_{j+1} - x_j\).
  - After each iteration, the array is sorted again.
  - The loop exits when all elements are equal.
- **Final State**: All elements in the array are equal, and the program prints the product of the smallest element and the number of elements.

### Issues Identified
- **Incorrect Minimal Sum Calculation**:
  - The program assumes that the minimal sum is always `x[0] * n` once all elements are equal. However, this is not always true.
  - For example, with the input:
    ```
    Input:
    4
    1 3 4 7
    ```
    The expected minimal sum is `4`, but the program will output `4` because it sorts the array and repeatedly subtracts the smallest value from the others until they are all equal, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the final output is `1 * 4 = 4`.

### Correct Approach
To achieve the correct minimal sum, the program should continue the operations until no further reductions can be made, and then sum the remaining elements. The current approach of sorting and repeatedly subtracting the smallest value does not always lead to the minimal sum.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program does not always produce the correct minimal sum, and hence it is incorrect.

Final: **False**
