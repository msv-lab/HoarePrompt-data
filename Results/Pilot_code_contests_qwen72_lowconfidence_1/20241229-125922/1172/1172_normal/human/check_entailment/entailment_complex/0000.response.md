Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in several key aspects:

1. **Redundant Sorting**: The program sorts the list `x` multiple times within the loop. However, sorting the list at each iteration is unnecessary and inefficient. Once the list is initially sorted, the subsequent operations should maintain the relative order of elements, so repeated sorting is redundant.

2. **Termination Condition**: The termination condition of the loop is flawed. The loop continues until all elements in the list `x` are equal. While this might work in some cases, it is not guaranteed to always produce the minimal sum. The correct approach should focus on reducing the elements until no further reduction is possible, rather than checking if all elements are equal.

3. **Minimal Sum Calculation**: The final output is calculated as `x[0] * n`, which is the value of the smallest element in the list multiplied by the number of elements. This is incorrect because the minimal sum is not necessarily the product of the smallest element and the number of elements. Instead, the minimal sum should be the sum of the remaining elements after all possible reductions.

### Correct Approach:

The correct approach to solve the problem is to repeatedly apply the operation `xi = xi - xj` until no further reduction is possible. The minimal sum can be achieved by ensuring that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements is used to reduce the elements to their smallest possible values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the GCD of all elements
    g = reduce(gcd, x)
    
    # The minimal sum is the GCD multiplied by the number of elements
    print(g * n)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input as specified in the problem description.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of all elements in the list `x` is calculated using the `reduce` function from the `functools` module and the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
3. **Minimal Sum Calculation**: The minimal sum is the GCD of all elements multiplied by the number of elements, which is the correct result according to the problem description.

By following this approach, the program ensures that it meets the requirements of the problem description and produces the correct minimal sum for any valid input.
