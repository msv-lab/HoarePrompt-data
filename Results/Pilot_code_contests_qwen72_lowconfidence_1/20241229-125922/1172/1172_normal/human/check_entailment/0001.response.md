Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific issue is that the program may not always reach the minimum possible sum due to its approach to the reduction process. Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Actual Output:**
```
15
```

The program outputs `15`, which is incorrect. The expected output is `5`, as the smallest number can be used to reduce all other numbers to their minimum possible values, resulting in all numbers being equal to `1`. The program fails to achieve this because it stops too early, without ensuring that all numbers are reduced to their minimum possible values.

This demonstrates that the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
