n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 20000. station is a list of n empty lists, where each sublist will eventually store integers representing the destination stations of candies that start at the corresponding station. Each (a, b) pair read from input satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
