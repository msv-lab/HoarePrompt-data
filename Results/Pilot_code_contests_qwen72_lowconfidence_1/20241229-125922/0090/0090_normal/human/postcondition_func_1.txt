The function `func_2` processes a set of (a, b) pairs, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, to populate a list `station` of n empty lists. Each sublist `station[i]` stores the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`. After populating `station`, the function calculates the minimum distance to the closest connected station for each station and stores these values in `max_candy`. Finally, it computes and prints the maximum distance for each starting station, considering all possible paths through the connected stations. The function handles edge cases where no connections exist for a station by skipping those iterations. The function modifies the `station` list in place and prints a sequence of n integers, each representing the maximum distance for the corresponding starting station.
