Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(0, dist)`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is 3. If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0.***
