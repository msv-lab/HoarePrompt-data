The code snippet assigns the value of `j - i` to the variable `dist`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Therefore, `dist` is calculated as 3 - 1, which equals 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `dist` is 2**.
