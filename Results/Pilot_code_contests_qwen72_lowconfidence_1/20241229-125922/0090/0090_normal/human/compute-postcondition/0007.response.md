The code snippet appends the value `b - 1` to the list located at index `a - 1` in the `station` list. This operation modifies the `station` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1][b - 1]` is now included, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, `a` ≠ `b`, and `m` must be greater than 1**
