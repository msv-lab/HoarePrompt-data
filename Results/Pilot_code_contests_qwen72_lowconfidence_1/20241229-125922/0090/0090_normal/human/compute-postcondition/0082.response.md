The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 0, and the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0**
