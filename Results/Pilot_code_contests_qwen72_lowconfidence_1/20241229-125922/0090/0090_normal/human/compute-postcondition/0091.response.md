The code snippet `dist = j - i` updates the value of `dist`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is `max(0, dist)`
- `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`
- `j` is 3

We calculate the new value of `dist`:
- `j` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `dist` is updated to `j - i`, which is `3 - 2 = 1`

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(0, 1)`, `dist` is 1, `j` is 3. If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0.**
