To solve this, let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
   - `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`.
   - `dist` is `(dist % n) + 1`.
   - `res` is unchanged.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
   ```

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `dist` is updated based on the given formula.
   - `j` is already defined as `(dist % n) + 1`, which means `j` is a value between 1 and `n`.
   - `station[j-1]` is the list of stations connected to station `j`.
   - `max_candy[j-1]` is the minimum value in `station[j-1]` based on the custom key function.

4. **Calculations**:
   - `len(station[j-1])` gives the number of stations connected to station `j`.
   - `(len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n` calculates the contribution from the length of the connected stations.
   - The term `(max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)` adjusts the distance based on the custom key function applied to `max_candy[j-1]`.

5. **Final Update**:
   - `dist` is updated to its new value based on the formula.

**Output State**:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`.
- `dist` is updated to `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`.
- `res` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`, `res` is unchanged**.
