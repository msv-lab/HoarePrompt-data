To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` and `m` remain the same.
   - `station` remains the same.
   - `i` remains `m`.
   - If `station[m - 1]` is not empty, `max_candy[m - 1]` is updated to the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`; otherwise, `max_candy[m - 1]` remains 0.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- **`i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be incremented from `m` to `m + 1`.
- **`n` and `m`**: These values remain unchanged.
- **`station`**: This remains unchanged.
- **`max_candy[m - 1]`**: This value was potentially updated in the previous iteration, but it will not change again unless the loop condition is met and the loop body is executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be `m + 1` and `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.

State: **`n` and `m` remain the same, `station` remains the same, `i` is `m + 1`, and if `station[m - 1]` is not empty, `max_candy[m - 1]` is updated to the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - (m + 1) if x < (m + 1) else x - (m + 1)`; otherwise, `max_candy[m - 1]` remains 0.**
