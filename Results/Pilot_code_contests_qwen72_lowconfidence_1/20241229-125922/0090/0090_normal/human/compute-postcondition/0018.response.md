The given code updates the value of `max_candy[i]` based on the contents of `station[i]` using a custom key function. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists, where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - If `station[m - 1]` is not empty, `max_candy[m - 1]` is set to the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function; otherwise, `max_candy[m - 1]` remains 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code updates `max_candy[i]` using the following logic:
     ```python
     max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)
     ```
   - This means `max_candy[i]` will be set to the minimum value in `station[i]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `max_candy[i]` is updated based on the contents of `station[i]` and the custom key function.
   - The value of `max_candy[i]` will be the minimum value in `station[i]` when evaluated by the key function.

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain the same.
   - `station` remains the same.
   - `i` remains `m`.
   - `max_candy` is updated such that `max_candy[m - 1]` is the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is `m`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros except `max_candy[m - 1]` which is the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`.**
