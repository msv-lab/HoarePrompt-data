To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `res` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i, i + n)`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is 0.
3. **Range Calculation**: The range becomes `range(0, n)`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n)` is valid.
- Since `i` is 0, the range is `range(0, n)`.
- For the range to be valid, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The initial state already specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, which ensures `n` is greater than 0.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `n`.

### Final State:
The loop will execute as long as the initial state is maintained, and no additional adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0**.
