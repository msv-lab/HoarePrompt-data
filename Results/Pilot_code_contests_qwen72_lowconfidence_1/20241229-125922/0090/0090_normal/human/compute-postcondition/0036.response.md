To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the changes that occur at the start of each iteration.

### Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `i + n - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
  - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
  - `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
  - `i` is 0.
  - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
  - `j` is `dist % n`.
  - `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
  - `res` is `max(0, dist)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `i + n - 1`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `j < i + n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j < i + n`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `dist`, `res`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `res` is `max(0, dist)`**.
