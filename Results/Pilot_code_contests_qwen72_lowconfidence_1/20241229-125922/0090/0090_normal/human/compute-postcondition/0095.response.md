To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`
- `j` is 3

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i, i + n)`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will increment `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will stop when `j` reaches `i + n`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is currently 3, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
- **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `i + n`. Since `i` is 2, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `2 + n`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` remains a list of `n` lists
- `i` remains 2
- `max_candy` remains a list of `n` elements
- `res` remains `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`
- `j` is incremented to 4

### State:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`, `j` is 4**
