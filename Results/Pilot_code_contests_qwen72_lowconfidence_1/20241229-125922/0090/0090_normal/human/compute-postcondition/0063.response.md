The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since no actual computation or variable modification takes place due to this statement, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum of 0 and `dist`, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0, `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`**
