To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the for loop:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given to be in the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, the loop will always execute at least once.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The initial state given is `i` is `n - 1`. However, in the context of the for loop, `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` should start from 0, not `n - 1`, for the loop to iterate correctly.
- The other variables (`m`, `station`, and `max_candy`) remain as they are, as they do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.**
