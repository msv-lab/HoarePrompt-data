The code `station[a - 1].append(b - 1)` appends the value `b - 1` to the list located at index `a - 1` in the `station` list. This means that the list `station[a - 1]` will now contain one more element, which is `b - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1][b - 1]` is now included
- `i` is 2
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`
- `m` must be greater than 2

After executing the code:
- The list `station[a - 1]` now includes the element `b - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` now includes `b - 1`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`, `m` must be greater than 2**
