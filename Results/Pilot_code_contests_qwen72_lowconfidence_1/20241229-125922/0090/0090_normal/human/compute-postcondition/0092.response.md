`j` is assigned the value of `j % n`. Given that `j` was 3 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, the new value of `j` is `3 % n`, which simplifies to 3 because 3 is less than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 1, `dist` is 1, `j` is 3**.
