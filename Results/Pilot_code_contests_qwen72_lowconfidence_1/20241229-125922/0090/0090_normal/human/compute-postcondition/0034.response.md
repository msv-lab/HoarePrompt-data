The given code snippet updates the value of `dist` based on the length of `station[j]` and the value of `max_candy[j]`. Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `j` is `dist % n`.
   - If the length of `station[j % n]` is 0, the length of `station[j % n]` is 0 and `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
   ```

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `dist` is updated by adding a value calculated from `len(station[j])`, `n`, and `max_candy[j]`.
   - The term `(len(station[j]) - 1) * n` adds the product of the length of `station[j]` minus 1 and `n` to `dist`.
   - The term `(max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)` adds a value based on the condition `max_candy[j] < j`.

4. **Calculating the New Value of `dist`**:
   - Let `len_station_j` be the length of `station[j]`.
   - Let `max_candy_j` be the value of `max_candy[j]`.
   - The new value of `dist` is:
     \[
     \text{dist} = \text{dist} + (\text{len\_station\_j} - 1) \times n + (\text{max\_candy\_j} + n - j \text{ if } \text{max\_candy\_j} < j \text{ else } \text{max\_candy\_j} - j)
     \]

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `j` is `dist % n`.
   - `dist` is updated to `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, `j` is `dist % n`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`**.
