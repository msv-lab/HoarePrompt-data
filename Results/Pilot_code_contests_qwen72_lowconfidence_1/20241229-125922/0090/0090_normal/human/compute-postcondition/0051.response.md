The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the value of `res` followed by a space. This operation does not alter any variables or the state of the program beyond printing to the console.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `res` is the maximum distance calculated for any non-empty station

After executing the code snippet, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `res` followed by a space to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum distance calculated for any non-empty station, and `res` has been printed to the console followed by a space.**
