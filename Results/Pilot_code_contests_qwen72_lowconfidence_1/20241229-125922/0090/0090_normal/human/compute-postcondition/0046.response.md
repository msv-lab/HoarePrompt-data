The code snippet `dist = j - i` updates the value of `dist` based on the current values of `j` and `i`.

- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `(dist % n) + 2`.
- `dist` is initially not specified in the initial state, so we assume it is undefined or not relevant before this line of code.

Given `i` is 0, the new value of `dist` will be:

\[ \text{dist} = j - i = ((\text{dist} \% n) + 2) - 0 = (\text{dist} \% n) + 2 \]

Since `dist` is not defined in the initial state, we consider the first calculation of `j` to be:

\[ j = (0 \% n) + 2 = 2 \]

Thus, the new value of `dist` becomes:

\[ \text{dist} = 2 - 0 = 2 \]

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is 2, `dist` is 2, `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.**
