The line `max_candy = [0] * n` initializes a list named `max_candy` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, or `station`. The list `max_candy` is now a list of zeros with length `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is `m - 1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.**
