To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements.
- `res` is `max(0, dist)`.
- `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
- `j` is `(j - 2) % n`.
- If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + n - 1`. Since `i` is 2, the loop will iterate from `2` to `2 + n - 1`, which simplifies to `2` to `n + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `(j - 2) % n`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `2` to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `n + 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `3`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(0, dist)`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is 3, If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0**
