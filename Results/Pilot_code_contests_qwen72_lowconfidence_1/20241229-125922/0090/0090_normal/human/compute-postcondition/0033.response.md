The code snippet `j %= n` updates the value of `j` to be the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, or `res`.

Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `j`: The value of `j` is updated to `j % n`. Since `j` was initially equal to `dist`, the new value of `j` is `dist % n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, `j` is `dist % n`. If the length of `station[j % n]` is 0, the length of `station[j % n]` is 0 and `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0.**
