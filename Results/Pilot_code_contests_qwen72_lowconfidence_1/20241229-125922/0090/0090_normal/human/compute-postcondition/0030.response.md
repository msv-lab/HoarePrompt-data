The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement would not have any effect in this context. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, and the length of `station[j % n]` is 0.**
