To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `res` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i, i + n)`. Since `i` is 1, the loop will iterate from `1` to `1 + n - 1`, which simplifies to `range(1, n + 1)`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n + 1)` is non-empty. This range is non-empty as long as `n` is greater than 0. Given that `n` is at least 2, the range is always non-empty.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `i` is already set to 1, which is correct for the loop to start.
- The variable `n` is already within the valid range (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000), ensuring the loop will execute.

### Final State:
Since the given state already ensures that the loop will execute, no further adjustments are needed. The state can be described as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0**
