The value of `j` is updated to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Given that `j` is initially 3 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5000, the new value of `j` will be 3 % `n`, which simplifies to 3 because 3 is less than `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `dist` is 2.
