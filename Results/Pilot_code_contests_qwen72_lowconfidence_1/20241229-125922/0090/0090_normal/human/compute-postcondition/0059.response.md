The code snippet `j %= n` performs a modulo operation on `j` using `n`, updating the value of `j` to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `res` is 0
- If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0
- `dist` is `j - 1`

After executing `j %= n`:
- `j` is updated to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. This means `j` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` inclusive.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0, `dist` is `j - 1`, `j` is `j % n`.**
