To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `res` is the maximum distance calculated for any non-empty station, and `res` has been printed to the console followed by a space.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains the same, and it must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum distance calculated for any non-empty station, and `res` has been printed to the console followed by a space.**
