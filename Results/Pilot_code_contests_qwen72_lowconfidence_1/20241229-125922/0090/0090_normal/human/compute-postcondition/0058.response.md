The code snippet `dist = j - i` calculates the difference between the variable `j` and the variable `i`, and assigns this difference to the new variable `dist`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `res` is 0
- If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0

The variable `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet. Assuming `j` is already defined and holds a value, the value of `dist` will be `j - 1` since `i` is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0, `dist` is `j - 1`.**
