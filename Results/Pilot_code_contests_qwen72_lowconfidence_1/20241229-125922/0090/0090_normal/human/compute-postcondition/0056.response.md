The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, since this is part of a loop, the loop control variables (`i` in this case) will be updated according to the loop's logic, but this specific snippet does not show the loop structure.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the variables remain unchanged, and the program simply moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is 0, and the current value of `len(station[j % n])` is 0**
