The value of `j` is updated to `j % n`. Given that `j` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `j % n` will be 2 because 2 is less than `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is 2, `dist` is 2, `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is 2, `dist` is 2, `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.**
