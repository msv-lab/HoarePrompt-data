The code snippet provided calculates the distance `dist` as `j - i`.

- Initial State: 
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
  - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
  - `station` is a list of `n` lists
  - `i` is 1
  - `j` is 2
  - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
  - If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0 and `res` is the maximum of 0 and `dist`, where `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.

- Impact of the code:
  - `dist` is assigned the value of `j - i`
  - `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so `dist` is calculated as `2 - 1`, which equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `dist` is 1.**
