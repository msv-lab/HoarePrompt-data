The code snippet `j %= n` updates the value of `j` to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Given that `j` is initially `(dist % n) + 1`, and `dist` is also `(dist % n) + 1`, we need to determine the final value of `j` after the modulo operation.

1. **Initial Value of `j`**: `j = (dist % n) + 1`
2. **Modulo Operation**: `j %= n` means `j = j % n`.

Since `j` is already in the form `(dist % n) + 1`, and `dist % n` is a value between 0 and `n-1`, adding 1 to it ensures that `j` is a value between 1 and `n`. When we perform `j %= n`, the value of `j` will be the same as `(dist % n) + 1` because `(dist % n) + 1` is already less than `n`.

Therefore, the value of `j` remains `(dist % n) + 1` after the modulo operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `dist` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `res` is unchanged**
