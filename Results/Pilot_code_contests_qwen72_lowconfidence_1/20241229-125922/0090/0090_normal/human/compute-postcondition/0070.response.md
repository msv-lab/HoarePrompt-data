The `continue` statement does not alter any variable values; it simply continues to the next iteration of a loop. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically cause an error if this were real code execution, but for the purposes of this simulation, we assume the context is part of a loop.

Given that the `continue` statement does not change any of the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `dist` is 1 + (len(station[2]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[2] + n - 2 if max_candy[2] < 2 else max_candy[2] - 2), `res` is max(res, dist)**
