To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `dist` is 1

### Code Snippet:
```python
dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `len(station[j])`**:
   - `j` is 2, so we need the length of `station[2]`.

2. **Calculate `(len(station[j]) - 1) * n`**:
   - Let `k = len(station[2])`.
   - This part of the expression becomes `(k - 1) * n`.

3. **Calculate the custom key function for `max_candy[j]`**:
   - `max_candy[j]` is already computed based on the custom key function.
   - If `max_candy[j] < j`, then the expression is `max_candy[j] + n - j`.
   - Otherwise, the expression is `max_candy[j] - j`.

4. **Combine the results**:
   - The final expression added to `dist` is `(k - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.

### Updated Values:
- `dist` is updated by adding the calculated value to the current value of `dist`.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `dist` is 1 + (len(station[2]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[2] + n - 2 if max_candy[2] < 2 else max_candy[2] - 2)

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `dist` is 1 + (len(station[2]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[2] + n - 2 if max_candy[2] < 2 else max_candy[2] - 2)**
