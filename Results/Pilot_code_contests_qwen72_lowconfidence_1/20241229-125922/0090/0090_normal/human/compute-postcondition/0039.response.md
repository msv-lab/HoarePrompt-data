The code snippet `dist = j - i` updates the value of `dist` based on the current values of `j` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`
- If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, `dist` is updated to `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, and `res` is set to `max(0, dist)`
- Otherwise, the values of `dist` and `res` remain unchanged

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 0.
2. `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`.
3. The new value of `dist` is calculated as `j - i`.

Since `i` is 0, the new value of `dist` simplifies to `j`.

Therefore, the updated value of `dist` is `(dist % n) + 1`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `dist` is `(dist % n) + 1`, `res` is unchanged**.
