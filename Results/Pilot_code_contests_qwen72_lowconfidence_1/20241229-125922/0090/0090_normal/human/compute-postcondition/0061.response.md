The code snippet updates the variable `res` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dist`. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. **Current Values**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
   - `res` is 0.
   - If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0.
   - `dist` is calculated as `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
   - `j` is `j % n`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - The line `res = max(res, dist)` updates `res` to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value of `dist`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `dist`.

4. **Updated State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `res` is now the maximum of its previous value (0) and the value of `dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum of 0 and `dist`, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0, `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is `j % n`.**
