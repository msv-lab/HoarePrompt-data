To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `n`, meaning it will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists, where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - If `station[m - 1]` is not empty, `max_candy[m - 1]` is set to the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on a custom key function; otherwise, `max_candy[m - 1]` remains 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently `m - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `m - 1 + 1` which simplifies to `m`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be `m`.
- `m` must be less than `n`.

Additionally, the other variables (`n`, `station`, and `max_candy`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is `m`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros. If `station[m - 1]` is not empty, `max_candy[m - 1]` is set to the minimum value in `station[m - 1]` based on the custom key function; otherwise, `max_candy[m - 1]` remains 0.**
