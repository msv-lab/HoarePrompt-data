The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the initial state, it is assumed that this `continue` is part of a loop that is not explicitly shown. The `continue` statement itself does not alter any variable values or states; it only affects the flow of the loop.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `j`, `dist`, and `res` remain unchanged. The loop, if present, would proceed to the next iteration, but since this is not specified in the initial state, it is not included in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 2`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`, `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.**
