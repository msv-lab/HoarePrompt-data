To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `res` is the maximum of 0 and `dist`, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0.
- `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
- `j` is `j % n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + n`. Since `i` is 1, the loop will iterate from `1` to `1 + n - 1` (inclusive).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[1, 1 + n - 1]`.

### State Adjustments:
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. If `j` is currently `1`, it will become `2`.
- **`max_candy`**: The value of `max_candy[j % n]` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.
- **`dist`**: The value of `dist` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` and the updated `max_candy[j % n]`.
- **`res`**: The value of `res` will be updated based on the new value of `dist`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is now 2.
- `max_candy` is updated for `j = 2` based on the custom key function.
- `dist` is updated for `j = 2` using the new `max_candy[2 % n]`.
- `res` is updated to the maximum of 0 and the new `dist`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum of 0 and `dist`, if `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0, `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`**.
