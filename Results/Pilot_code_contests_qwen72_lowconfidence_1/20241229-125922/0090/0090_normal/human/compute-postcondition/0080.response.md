To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial state:

```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 2.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements.
- `res` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(i, i + n)` contains at least one element.
2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The start of the range is `i`, which is 2.
   - The end of the range is `i + n`, which is `2 + n`.
   - For the range to contain at least one element, `i + n` must be greater than `i`.
   - This simplifies to `2 + n > 2`, which is always true since `n` is at least 2.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - Since `2 + n > 2` is always true for `n ≥ 2`, the loop will always execute at least once.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` will start at 2 and go up to `2 + n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
The loop will execute as long as the conditions on `n` and `i` are met, which they are. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 0**.
