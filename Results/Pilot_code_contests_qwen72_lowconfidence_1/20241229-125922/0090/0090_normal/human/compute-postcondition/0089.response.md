The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end prematurely, and the control moves to the next iteration of the loop. This means that no changes are made to the variables in the current iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was encountered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(0, dist)`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is 3, If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0**
