Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 2`. If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, `dist` is updated to `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`, and `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.***
