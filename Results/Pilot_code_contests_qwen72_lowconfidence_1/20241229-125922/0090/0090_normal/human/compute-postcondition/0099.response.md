The value of `j` is updated to `j % n`. Given that `j` was 4 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5000, the new value of `j` is 4 % n. Since 4 is less than the minimum value of `n` (which is 2), `j` remains 4.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`, `j` is 4, `dist` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`, `j` is 4, `dist` is 2**
