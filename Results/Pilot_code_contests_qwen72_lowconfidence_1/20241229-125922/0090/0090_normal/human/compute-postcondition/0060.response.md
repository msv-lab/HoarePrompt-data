Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `res` is 0
- If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0
- `dist` is `j - 1`
- `j` is `j % n`

Code Snippet:
```python
dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `len(station[j])`**: This is the number of stations connected to station `j + 1`.
2. **Calculate `(len(station[j]) - 1) * n`**: This part of the expression multiplies the number of connected stations minus one by `n`.
3. **Calculate `(max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`**:
   - If `max_candy[j] < j`, then the expression evaluates to `max_candy[j] + n - j`.
   - Otherwise, it evaluates to `max_candy[j] - j`.
4. **Update `dist`**: Add the results of the above calculations to `dist`.

Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `res` is 0
- If `len(station[j % n])` is 0, then `max_candy[j % n]` remains 0
- `dist` is `j - 1 + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`
- `j` is `j % n`
