The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `station`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new values of `a` and `b` are now the integers read from the input, and they satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1][b - 1]` is defined, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, `a` ≠ `b`, and `m` must be greater than 1**
