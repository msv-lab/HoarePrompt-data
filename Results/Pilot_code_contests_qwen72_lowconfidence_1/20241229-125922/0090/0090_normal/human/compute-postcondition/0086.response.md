To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is 0
- `dist` is `j - 2`
- `j` is `(j - 2) % n`
- If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0

### Code Snippet:
```python
dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Calculate `len(station[j])`**:
   - `j` is defined as `(j - 2) % n`. Since `j` is already defined in the initial state, we use this value.
   - Let's denote `len(station[j])` as `len_station_j`.

2. **Calculate the first part of the addition**:
   - `(len_station_j - 1) * n`

3. **Calculate the second part of the addition**:
   - We need to evaluate the condition `if max_candy[j] < j`.
   - If `max_candy[j] < j`, then the value is `max_candy[j] + n - j`.
   - If `max_candy[j] >= j`, then the value is `max_candy[j] - j`.

4. **Update `dist`**:
   - `dist` is updated by adding the results from steps 2 and 3.

### Output State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is 0
- `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`
- `j` is `(j - 2) % n`
- If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 0, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is `(j - 2) % n`, If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0**
