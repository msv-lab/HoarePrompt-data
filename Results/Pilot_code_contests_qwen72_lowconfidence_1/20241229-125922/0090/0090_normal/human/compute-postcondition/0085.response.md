The code snippet `j %= n` updates the value of `j` to be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `res`, or the condition about the length of `station[j % n]`.

Given that `j` was initially defined as `j - 2`, the value of `j` before the modulo operation is `j - 2`. After the operation `j %= n`, the new value of `j` will be `(j - 2) % n`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 0, `dist` is `j - 2`, `j` is `(j - 2) % n`, If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0.**
