According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1][b - 1]` is now included, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, `a` ≠ `b`, and `m` must be greater than 2**
