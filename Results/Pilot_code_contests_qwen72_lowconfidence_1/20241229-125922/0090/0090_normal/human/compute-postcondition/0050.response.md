To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the overall effect of the loop after all iterations have completed. Let's break down the loop and analyze its behavior step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- `res` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    if len(station[j % n]) == 0:
        continue
    dist = j - i
    j %= n
    dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
    res = max(res, dist)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + n`. Since `i` is initially 0, this means the loop will iterate from 0 to `n - 1`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each `j` in the range, if `station[j % n]` is empty, the loop continues to the next iteration. This ensures that only non-empty stations are considered.
3. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - `dist` is initialized to `j - i`.
   - `j` is then taken modulo `n` to ensure it stays within the bounds of the list.
   - `dist` is updated to include the length of the station list and the value from `max_candy`.
4. **Update `res`**: `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `dist`.

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: Remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- **`m`**: Remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000.
- **`station`**: Remains a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`.
- **`i`**: Remains 0.
- **`max_candy`**: Remains a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0.
- **`res`**: After the loop completes, `res` will be the maximum value of `dist` calculated across all iterations of the loop where `station[j % n]` is not empty.

### Summary:
The loop iterates through all stations, calculates a distance value for each non-empty station, and updates `res` to the maximum of these distances. If no station is connected, `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `res` is the maximum distance calculated for any non-empty station.**
