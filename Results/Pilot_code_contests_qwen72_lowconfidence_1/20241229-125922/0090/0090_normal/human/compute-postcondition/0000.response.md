The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, while the initial conditions about `station` being a list of `n` empty lists and the constraints on `a` and `b` pairs remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by `input()`, `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, each (a, b) pair read from input satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.**
