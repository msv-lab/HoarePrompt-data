The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values read from the input, split by space. The variables `n` and `m` retain their updated values from the input, and `station` remains a list of `n` empty lists. The variable `i` remains 0. The conditions that `n` and `m` are integers within their respective ranges, and that each (a, b) pair satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, remain valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by `input()`, `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, and `a` ≠ `b`**
