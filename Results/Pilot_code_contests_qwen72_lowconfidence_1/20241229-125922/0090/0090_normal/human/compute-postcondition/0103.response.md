The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print(res, end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `m`: An integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 20000\).
   - `station`: A list of `n` lists.
   - `i`: 2.
   - `max_candy`: A list of `n` elements.
   - `res`: The maximum value of `dist` calculated during the loop, where:
     \[
     \text{dist} = (j - 2) + (\text{len}(\text{station}[j \% n]) - 1) \times n + (\text{max\_candy}[j \% n] + n - j \% n \text{ if } \text{max\_candy}[j \% n] < j \% n \text{ else } \text{max\_candy}[j \% n] - j \% n)
     \]
     for each valid `j` in the range `i` to `i + n - 1` where `station[j % n]` is not empty. If no valid `dist` is calculated, `res` remains 0.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The `print` function outputs the value of `res` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

3. **Output State:**
   - The value of `res` is printed.
   - No variables are modified by this code snippet.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is the maximum value of `dist` calculated during the loop, where `dist = (j - 2) + (len(station[j % n]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j % n] + n - j % n if max_candy[j % n] < j % n else max_candy[j % n] - j % n)` for each valid `j` in the range `i` to `i + n - 1` where `station[j % n]` is not empty. If no valid `dist` is calculated, `res` remains 0.**
