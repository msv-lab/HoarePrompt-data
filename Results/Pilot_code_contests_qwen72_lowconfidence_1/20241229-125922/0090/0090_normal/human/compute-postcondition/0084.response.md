The code snippet `dist = j - i` calculates the difference between `j` and `i`, and assigns this value to the variable `dist`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown. However, the calculation of `dist` depends on the value of `j`.

Since `j` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `dist`. However, we know that `dist` will be `j - 2`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is 0, `dist` is `j - 2`. If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, then the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0.**
