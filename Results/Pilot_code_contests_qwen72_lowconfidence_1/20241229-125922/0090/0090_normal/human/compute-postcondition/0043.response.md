To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the requirements and the changes that occur during each iteration of the loop:

### Given Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0
- `j` is `(dist % n) + 1`
- `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`
- `res` is the maximum of its previous value and `dist`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i, i + n)`. Since `i` is 0, the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. If `j` was `(dist % n) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `(dist % n) + 2`.
   - **`dist`**: The value of `dist` is updated within the loop body. For the next iteration, `dist` will be the new value calculated in the previous iteration.
   - **`res`**: `res` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000)
- `m` remains the same (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000)
- `station` remains the same (a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`)
- `i` remains 0
- `max_candy` remains the same (a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0)
- `j` is now `(dist % n) + 2`
- `dist` is now `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`
- `res` is now the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each element `max_candy[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) is the minimum value in `station[j]` based on the custom key function `lambda x: x + n - j if x < j else x - j` if `station[j]` is not empty; otherwise, `max_candy[j]` remains 0, `j` is `(dist % n) + 2`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j-1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j-1] + n - j if max_candy[j-1] < j else max_candy[j-1] - j)`, `res` is the maximum of its previous value and the new `dist` value**
