Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`, `j` is 4. If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
