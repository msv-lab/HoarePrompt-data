Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[i]` contains the indices of stations connected to station `i + 1` based on the input pairs `(a, b)`, `i` is `m - 1`, and each `(a, b)` pair read from input satisfies 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `station` remains a list of `n` empty lists.**
