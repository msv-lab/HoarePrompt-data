The code reads two integers, `a` and `b`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are constrained to be between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and `a` ≠ `b`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1][b - 1]` is now included, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n` and `a` ≠ `b`, `m` must be greater than 2**
