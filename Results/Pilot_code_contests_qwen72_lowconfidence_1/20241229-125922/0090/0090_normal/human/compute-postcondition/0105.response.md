The function `func_2` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided context, it appears that the function likely interacts with external variables or inputs, specifically `n`, `m`, and `station`, which are described as part of the problem's setup. 

- `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 20000.
- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, intended to store integers representing the destination stations of candies that start at the corresponding station.
- Each (a, b) pair read from input satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.

Given this context, the function `func_2` processes these inputs to populate the `station` list according to the rules defined by the (a, b) pairs. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but typically such functions would either modify the `station` list in place or return a modified version of it.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of (a, b) pairs where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, populating a list `station` of `n` empty lists with integers representing the destination stations of candies starting at the corresponding station. The function modifies the `station` list in place.**
