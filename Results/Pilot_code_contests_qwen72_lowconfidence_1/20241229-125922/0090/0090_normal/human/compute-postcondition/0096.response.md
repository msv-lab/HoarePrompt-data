The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end and moves on to the next iteration. However, in the context provided, there is no explicit loop shown. Assuming this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop structure, its effect would be to skip the rest of the code block within the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 2
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`
- `j` is 4

The `continue` statement does not alter any of the variables. It only affects the flow of the program within a loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 2, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is `max(1, 1 + (len(station[3]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[3] + n - 3 if max_candy[3] < 3 else max_candy[3] - 3))`, `j` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
