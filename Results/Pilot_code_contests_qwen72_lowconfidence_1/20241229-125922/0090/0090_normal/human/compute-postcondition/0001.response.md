The code initializes `station` to be a list of `n` empty lists, where `n` is an integer provided by the input. The values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input, and the structure of `station` reflects this new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by `input()`, `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, each (a, b) pair read from input satisfies 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.**
