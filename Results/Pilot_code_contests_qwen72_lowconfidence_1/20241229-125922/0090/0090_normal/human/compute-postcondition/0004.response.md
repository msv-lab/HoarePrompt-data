The code `station[a - 1].append(b - 1)` modifies the list `station` by appending the value `b - 1` to the list at index `a - 1`. This operation affects the `station` list but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.

- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, and they are updated to the values provided by `input()`.
- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from input, with 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, and `a` ≠ `b`.
- After executing the code, the list at `station[a - 1]` now contains the value `b - 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 20000, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` is `[b - 1]`, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`, and `a` ≠ `b`**
