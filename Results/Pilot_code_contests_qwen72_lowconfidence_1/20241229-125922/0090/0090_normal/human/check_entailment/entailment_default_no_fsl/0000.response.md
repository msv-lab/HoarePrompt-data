Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the delivery of candies in all cases. Specifically, the calculation of the minimum time required to deliver all candies is flawed. The issue lies in how the function calculates the `max_candy` values and the subsequent distances.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `max_candy`**:
   - The line `max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)` is intended to find the closest destination for the candies at station `i`. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the circular nature of the stations properly. The formula `x + n - i if x < i else x - i` is not the correct way to calculate the minimum distance in a circular array.

2. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance calculation inside the nested loop is also flawed. The line `dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)` does not correctly compute the total distance required to deliver all candies. The term `(len(station[j]) - 1) * n` assumes that the train will always take the full circle for each additional candy, which is not necessarily true. Additionally, the distance calculation for the last candy is incorrect due to the same circular distance issue mentioned above.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where a station has multiple candies with different destinations correctly. The current implementation may not find the optimal path for delivering all candies efficiently.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  5 7
  2 4
  5 1
  2 3
  3 4
  4 1
  5 3
  3 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  10 9 10 10 9
  ```
- Actual Output (based on the provided code):
  The actual output may differ from the expected output due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
