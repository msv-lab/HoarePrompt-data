Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum time to deliver all candies from each starting station is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Distance to Closest Connected Station**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the minimum distance to the closest connected station for each station using the line:
     ```python
     max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)
     ```
   - This calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the circular nature of the railway network properly. For example, if `i` is close to `n` and `x` is small, the distance calculation should wrap around the circle, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Distance**:
   - The function calculates the total distance for each starting station using the line:
     ```python
     dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
     ```
   - This calculation is also flawed. It assumes that the train will always pick up the candy with the minimum distance to its destination, but it does not account for the fact that the train can only pick up one candy per station. The correct approach would involve simulating the train's movements and keeping track of the candies picked up and delivered.

3. **Handling of Empty Stations**:
   - The function skips stations with no candies using the line:
     ```python
     if len(station[j % n]) == 0:
         continue
     ```
   - While this is correct, the overall logic for calculating the minimum time is still incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

To correctly solve the problem, the train's movements and candy delivery should be simulated more accurately, taking into account the constraints and the circular nature of the railway network. The current implementation does not handle these aspects correctly, leading to incorrect results for many potential cases.
