Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not correctly handle the calculation of the minimum time required to deliver all candies for each starting station. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_2` for calculating the minimum distance to the closest connected station and the maximum distance for each starting station has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Distance (`max_candy`)**:
   - The line `max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)` is intended to find the minimum distance to the closest connected station. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the circular nature of the stations. For example, if `i = 4` and `n = 5`, and `station[4]` contains `[0, 1]`, the correct minimum distance to station 0 should be 1 (since the train can go from 4 to 0 in 1 second), but the current logic would incorrectly calculate it as 4.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Distance (`res`)**:
   - The loop that calculates the total distance for each starting station (`for j in range(i, i + n)`) has issues with the way it calculates the distance. The line `dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)` is complex and does not correctly account for the circular nature of the stations. For example, if `j = 4` and `max_candy[4] = 0`, the distance should be 1, but the current logic might incorrectly calculate it as 4.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where a station has no candies to deliver. While it skips such stations, it does not ensure that the overall time calculation is correct for all other stations.

To correct these issues, the logic for calculating the minimum distance and the total distance needs to be revised to properly handle the circular nature of the stations and ensure that the distances are calculated correctly for all possible cases.
