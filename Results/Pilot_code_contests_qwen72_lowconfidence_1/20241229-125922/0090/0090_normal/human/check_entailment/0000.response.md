Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case where the train starts at a station that does not contain any candies to pick up. In such a case, the train should still account for the time taken to reach the next station with candies to load. However, the current implementation does not consider this scenario correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 3
1 2
3 4
5 1
```
If the train starts at station 2, it should move to station 1 to pick up the first candy, then proceed to station 2 to deliver it, and so on. However, the current implementation does not correctly account for the initial movement to the next station with candies, leading to an incorrect result.

This indicates that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
