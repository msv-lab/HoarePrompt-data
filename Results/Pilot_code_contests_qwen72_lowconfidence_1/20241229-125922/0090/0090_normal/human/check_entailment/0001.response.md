Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the train starts at a station with no candies to pick up. Specifically, the calculation of `max_candy` is flawed. The `min` function is used to find the minimum distance to the destination of a candy from the current station, but this approach does not correctly account for the circular nature of the railway network. For example, if the train starts at a station with no candies and the next station has a candy, the program might incorrectly calculate the time required to deliver all candies.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3 2
1 2
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
3 3 3
```

Actual Output:
```
3 3 4
```

In this case, the train starting at station 3 should be able to deliver all candies in 3 seconds, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 4 seconds. This is because the program does not correctly handle the circular nature of the railway network when calculating the minimum distance to the destination of a candy.
