**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Time:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum time required to deliver all candies starting from each station. However, the logic used to compute the minimum time is flawed.
   - Specifically, the calculation of `max_candy` and the subsequent computation of `dist` do not correctly account for the constraints of the problem, particularly the rule that only one candy can be loaded per station per visit.

2. **Handling of Empty Stations:**
   - The program correctly skips over stations that have no candies to deliver. However, the way it calculates the minimum time does not ensure that the train visits each station exactly once to pick up a candy if necessary.

3. **Incorrect Distance Calculation:**
   - The distance calculation inside the nested loop is incorrect. The formula used to calculate the distance `dist` does not accurately reflect the time required to deliver all candies starting from a particular station.

4. **Logical Flaws:**
   - The use of `max_candy` to store the minimum distance to the destination station is not appropriate for this problem. The problem requires calculating the total time to deliver all candies, not just the minimum distance to the nearest destination.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
5 7
2 4
5 1
2 3
3 4
4 1
5 3
3 5
```

The expected output is:
```
10 9 10 10 9
```

However, the program's current logic will likely produce different results because it does not correctly simulate the process of loading and delivering candies according to the rules specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the algorithm required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
