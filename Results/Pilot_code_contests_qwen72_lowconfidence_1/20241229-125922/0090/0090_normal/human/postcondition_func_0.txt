The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are expected to be non-negative integers. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function handles the case where either `x` or `y` is 0 by returning the non-zero value as the GCD, and it correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 by returning 0.
