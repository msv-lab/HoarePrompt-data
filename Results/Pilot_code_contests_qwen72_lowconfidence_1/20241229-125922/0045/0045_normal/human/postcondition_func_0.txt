The function `func` reads input from stdin, where the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by `n` lines, each containing a string in the format "<suit> <rank>". The function then updates a dictionary `d` to mark the presence of each card. After processing the input, the function prints the missing cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where each card is represented as a string in the format "<suit> <rank>". If `n` is 0, no cards are marked as present, and the function prints all 52 cards. The function does not return any value; it only prints the missing cards to stdout.
