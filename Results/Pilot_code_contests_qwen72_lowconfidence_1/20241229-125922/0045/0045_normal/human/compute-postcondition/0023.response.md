The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately, and the control moves to the next iteration of the loop. However, this action does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, or the dictionary `d`. The conditions and the structure of the loop remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the loop control has moved to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.**
