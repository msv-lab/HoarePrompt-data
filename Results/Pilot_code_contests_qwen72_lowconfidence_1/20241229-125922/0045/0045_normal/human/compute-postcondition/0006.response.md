The code snippet `x, y = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on a space, and assigns the first part to `x` and the second part to `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` and the rest are `None`
- `x` is the first part of the input
- `y` is the second part of the input

After executing the code:
- `x` is now the first part of the input provided by the user
- `y` is now the second part of the input provided by the user

The values of `n`, `i`, and the structure of `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` and the rest are `None`, `x` is the first part of the user input, `y` is the second part of the user input.**
