The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the effect of `continue` cannot be fully determined, but it implies that the program will skip any remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of a loop.

However, since the initial state does not specify a loop, we can only note that the `continue` statement would take effect if this code were within a loop. No variables are changed by the `continue` statement itself.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is 'H', `d['H'][1]` is falsy, and the program will skip the rest of the current iteration if this code is within a loop.
