The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
- `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
- The current value of `d[k][i]` is `True`.

After executing the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. The current value of `d[k][i]` is `True`.**
