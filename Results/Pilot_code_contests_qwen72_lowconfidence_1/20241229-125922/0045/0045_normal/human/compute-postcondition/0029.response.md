Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. The current value of `d[k][i]` is `True`.**
