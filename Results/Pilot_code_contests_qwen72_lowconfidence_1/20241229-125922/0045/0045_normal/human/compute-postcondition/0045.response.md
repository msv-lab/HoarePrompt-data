The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `i`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged. However, the `continue` statement implies that the next iteration of the loop will proceed, assuming this is part of a loop structure.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. The value at `d[k][i]` is truthy. The current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will proceed.**
