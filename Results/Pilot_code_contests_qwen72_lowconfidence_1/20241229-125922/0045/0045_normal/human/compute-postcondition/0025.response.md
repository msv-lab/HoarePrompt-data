The code snippet provided prints a formatted string using the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `d` are not modified by this code snippet. However, the output of the print statement depends on the current values of `k` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
- For each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True`.
- If `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.

The code snippet:
```python
print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `k` and `i + 1` are used to print a formatted string.
- The variables `n`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration. The formatted string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) is printed.**
