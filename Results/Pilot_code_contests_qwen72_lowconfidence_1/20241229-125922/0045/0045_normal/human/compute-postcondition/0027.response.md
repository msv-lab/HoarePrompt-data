To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
  - For each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True`.
  - The rest of the values in the lists are `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`, which is fixed and contains 4 elements. Therefore, the loop will always execute 4 times regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, or `d`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over a fixed list, the only state that needs to be considered is the current value of `k` and the state of the dictionary `d`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `n` or `i`, but it does depend on the state of `d` to determine what to print.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will proceed to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` in the order they appear.
   - The state of `d` remains the same between iterations of the loop.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state of `k` will change to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.**
