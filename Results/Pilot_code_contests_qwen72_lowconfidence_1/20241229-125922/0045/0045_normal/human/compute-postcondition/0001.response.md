The dictionary `d` is initialized with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values. This dictionary represents the state of the cards, where each suit has 13 positions corresponding to the ranks.

The initial state variables remain unchanged, and the new state includes the initialized dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values.**
