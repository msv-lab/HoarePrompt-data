Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. After the loop finishes, for each key `k` in `d` and each index `i` in the range 0 to 12, if `d[k][i]` was initially `None`, the string `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` has been printed. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged, preserving its structure and values as described in the initial state. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
