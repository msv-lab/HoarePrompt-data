The code snippet reads an input from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, this input is expected to be an integer between 1 and 52, representing the number of cards Taro has.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by `n` lines, each containing a string representing a card in the format "<suit> <rank>", where `<suit>` is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and `<rank>` is an integer from 1 to 13. `n` is an input integer.**
