To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values.
   - `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.
   - If `d[k][i]` is truthy, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will proceed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(13):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `k` will remain the same unless it is explicitly changed within the loop body (which is omitted here).
   - The condition `if d[k][i]` being truthy or falsy will determine whether the current iteration is skipped.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The dictionary `d` and the key `k` will remain the same unless modified within the loop body.
   - The condition `d[k][i]` will now check `d[k][1]` to determine if the iteration should be skipped.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `d[k][1]` is truthy, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will proceed.**
