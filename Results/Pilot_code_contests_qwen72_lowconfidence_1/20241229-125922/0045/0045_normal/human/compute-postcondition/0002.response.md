To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(n)` function on the first iteration.
3. **Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` does not affect the loop execution directly, but it is part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it explicitly. The dictionary `d` remains as is because it does not impact the loop's execution.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values.**
