To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 12.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values.
- `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(13):
    if d[k][i]:
        continue
    print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs 13 times, iterating over `i` from 0 to 12.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `d[k][i]` is truthy. If it is, the loop skips to the next iteration using `continue`.
   - If `d[k][i]` is falsy, it prints the string `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)`.

2. **Variable States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `i` is redefined within the loop to iterate from 0 to 12.
   - `d` remains the same dictionary with the same lists of 13 values.
   - `k` remains the same key from the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` that was determined before the loop started.

3. **Output State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will have iterated from 0 to 12.
   - The state of `d` and `k` will remain the same as they were before the loop started.
   - The output will be a series of strings printed if `d[k][i]` is falsy for any `i`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
- `i` has been used in the loop to iterate from 0 to 12.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values (unchanged).
- `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k` (unchanged).
- The loop has printed strings of the form `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` for each `i` where `d[k][i]` is falsy.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` has been used in the loop to iterate from 0 to 12, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. Strings of the form `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` have been printed for each `i` where `d[k][i]` is falsy.**
