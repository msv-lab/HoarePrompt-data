Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `d[k][i]` is truthy, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will proceed.***
