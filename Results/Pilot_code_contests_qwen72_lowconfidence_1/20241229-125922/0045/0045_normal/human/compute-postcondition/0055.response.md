The code prints the formatted string `%s %d` using the values of `k` and `i + 1`. The value of `k` is 'H', and `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. The output of the print statement will be `'H 3'`.

The variables `n`, `i`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition `d['H'][1]` being falsy does not affect the execution of this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is 'H', `d['H'][1]` is falsy, and the string 'H 3' is printed.**
