The code snippet `d[x][int(y) - 1] = True` modifies the dictionary `d` by setting the value at the index `int(y) - 1` of the list associated with the key `x` to `True`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values (partially changed)
- `x` is the first part of the input (unchanged)
- `y` is the second part of the input (unchanged)

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is set to `True`.
- All other values in the dictionary remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` and the rest are `None`, `x` is the first part of the input, `y` is the second part of the input.**
