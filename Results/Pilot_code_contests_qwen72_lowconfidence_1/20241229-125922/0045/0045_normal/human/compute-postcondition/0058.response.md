The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from standard input (stdin). The input consists of:

- An integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) indicating the number of cards Taro has.
- Followed by `n` lines, each containing a string in the format "<suit> <rank>", where `<suit>` is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and `<rank>` is an integer from 1 to 13.

The function returns a list of strings, each representing a card that is missing from the standard deck of 52 cards (13 cards per suit).

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, where the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by `n` lines, each containing a string in the format "<suit> <rank>". It returns a list of strings representing the cards that are missing from the standard deck of 52 cards.**
