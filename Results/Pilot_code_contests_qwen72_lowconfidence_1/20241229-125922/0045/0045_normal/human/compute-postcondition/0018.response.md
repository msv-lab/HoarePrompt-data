To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
- If `d[k][i]` is `True`, the condition holds; otherwise, the condition does not hold and no changes are made to `d[k][i]`.
- The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) is printed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(13):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop starts at 0 and goes up to 12, the next value of `i` will be `n`.

### Adjustments:
- **`i`**: Increment `i` by 1.
- **`n`**: Since `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n`.
- **`d`**: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes are made to `d`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `d` remains a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.**
