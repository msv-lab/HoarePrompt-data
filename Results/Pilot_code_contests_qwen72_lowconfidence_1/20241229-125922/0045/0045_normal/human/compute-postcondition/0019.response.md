The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. It does not change the values of the variables but affects the flow control within a loop. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this is part of an existing loop.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
