The code snippet `x, y = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and assigns the first part to `x` and the second part to `y`. This changes the values of `x` and `y` from their initial conditions to the values provided by the user.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` and the rest are `None`
- `x` is the first part of the user input (initially undefined)
- `y` is the second part of the user input (initially undefined)

After executing the code snippet, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the user-provided values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` and the rest are `None`, `x` is the first part of the user input, `y` is the second part of the user input.**
