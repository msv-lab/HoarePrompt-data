Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.***
