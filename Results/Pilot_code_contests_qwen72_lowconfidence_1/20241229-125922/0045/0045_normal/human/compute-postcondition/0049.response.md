The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately, and the control moves to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the next iteration will proceed, potentially with a different value of `k` depending on the loop structure. Since the precondition mentions that if `d[k][1]` is truthy, the current iteration is skipped, this condition remains true, and the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `d[k][1]` is truthy, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration will proceed.**
