To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
   - For each valid input `(x, y)`, `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True`.
   - The rest of the values in the lists are `None`.
   - If `d[k][i]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(13):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than 13.
   - The value of `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than 13, so `n + 1` must be less than 13.
   - The condition `d[k][i]` being `True` must hold for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the adjusted state for the next iteration is:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `d` remains the same dictionary structure.
- The loop will continue if `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `d[k][n + 1]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration.**
