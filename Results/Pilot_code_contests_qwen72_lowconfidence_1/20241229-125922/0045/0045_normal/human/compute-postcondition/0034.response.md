The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop. Since no changes are made to any variables within the provided code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
