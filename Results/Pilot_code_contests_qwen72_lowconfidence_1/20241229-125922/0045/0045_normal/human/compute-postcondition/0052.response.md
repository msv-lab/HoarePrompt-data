To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the conditions:

1. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values.
   - `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.
   - If `d[k][1]` is truthy, the current iteration is skipped.
   - If `d[k][1]` is falsy, the current iteration continues, and the string `'%s %d' % (k, 2)` is printed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(13):` will continue as long as `i` is less than 13.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, it should be 2 for the next iteration.
   - **`k`**: `k` needs to be the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If the current `k` is 'S', the next `k` will be 'H'. If `k` is 'H', the next `k` will be 'C', and so on.
   - **`d[k][1]`**: This value determines whether the current iteration is skipped or not. For the loop to execute one more time, `d[k][1]` must be falsy (since if it's truthy, the iteration is skipped).

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `k` moves to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`.
- The value of `d[k][1]` must be falsy for the loop to proceed.

Assuming the current `k` is 'S', the next `k` will be 'H'. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is 'H', `d['H'][1]` is falsy**.
