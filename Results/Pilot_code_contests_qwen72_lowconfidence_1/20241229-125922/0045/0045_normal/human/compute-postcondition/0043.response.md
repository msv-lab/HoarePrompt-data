To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

- The loop is defined as `for i in range(13):`, which means the loop will iterate 13 times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 12.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0, not 12, because the loop expects `i` to start from 0 and increment up to 12.
- The variable `n` being a non-negative integer does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it is part of the initial state and should be mentioned.
- The dictionary `d` and the variable `k` are part of the initial state but do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop executes correctly are:

- `i` must be set to 0.
- The loop will execute 13 times regardless of the value of `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`**
