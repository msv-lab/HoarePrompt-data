To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
   - If `d[k][i]` is `True`, it remains `True`.
   - If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, it remains `None`.
   - `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(13):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 12 (inclusive).
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The dictionary `d` and the key `k` remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
   - The other variables (`n`, `d`, `k`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
