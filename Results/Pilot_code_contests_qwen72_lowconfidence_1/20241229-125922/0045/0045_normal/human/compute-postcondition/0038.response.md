The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Since this is the only operation performed, none of the variables (`n`, `i`, `d`, `k`) are modified by this statement. The structure and content of `d` remain unchanged, and the value of `k` does not change.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) has been printed.**
