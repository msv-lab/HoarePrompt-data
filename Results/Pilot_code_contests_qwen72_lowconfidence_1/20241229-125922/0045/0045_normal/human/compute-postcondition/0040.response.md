The provided Python code snippet only includes a print statement. This means the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the specified string is printed.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is 2
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values
- If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition
- If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`
- If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`
- If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`
- The string `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` has been printed

The print statement `print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))` will print the string formed by the key `k` and the value of `i + 1`, which is 3.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) has been printed.**
