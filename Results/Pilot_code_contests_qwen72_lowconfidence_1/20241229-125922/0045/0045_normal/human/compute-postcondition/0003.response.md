The code snippet `x, y = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting parts to the variables `x` and `y`.

- `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (unchanged)
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values (unchanged)
- `x` is assigned the first part of the split input
- `y` is assigned the second part of the split input

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 `None` values, `x` is the first part of the input, `y` is the second part of the input.**
