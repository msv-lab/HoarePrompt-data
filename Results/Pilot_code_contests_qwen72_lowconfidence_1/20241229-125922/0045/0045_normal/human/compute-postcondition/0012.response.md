To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. The loop iterates over the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`. This means the loop will execute as long as this list is not empty.
2. The state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
   - If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.

Given these conditions, the loop will always execute because the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` is not empty. However, we need to ensure that the initial state is consistent with the loop's execution.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`**: This list is fixed and contains 4 elements, so the loop will always execute at least once.
2. **Variable `n`**: It is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 0, then `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
3. **Variable `i`**: It is set to `n - 1`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, which is consistent with the given state.
4. **Dictionary `d`**: It has keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.

Since the loop will always execute at least once due to the non-empty list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`, no adjustments are needed to the given state for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
