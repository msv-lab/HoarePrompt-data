To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values.
- `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(13):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(13):` will always execute 13 times regardless of the initial value of `i` because `range(13)` generates a sequence from 0 to 12.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`. This value is not used inside the loop itself, as the loop reassigns `i` from 0 to 12.
3. **Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. The values are `True` for valid inputs and `None` otherwise. This state does not affect the loop execution but is important for the loop body.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, but this does not affect the loop execution. The loop will overwrite `i` with values from 0 to 12.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the loop execution, but if `n` is 0, then `i` is -1, which is not used in the loop.
- **`d`**: The dictionary `d` should remain as described, with each key having a list of 13 values, initially all `None`.

### Final State:
Since the loop will execute 13 times regardless of the initial value of `i`, and the dictionary `d` is already in the correct state, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
