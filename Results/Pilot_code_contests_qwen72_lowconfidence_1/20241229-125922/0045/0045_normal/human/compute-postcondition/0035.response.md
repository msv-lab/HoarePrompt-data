Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, and `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.***
