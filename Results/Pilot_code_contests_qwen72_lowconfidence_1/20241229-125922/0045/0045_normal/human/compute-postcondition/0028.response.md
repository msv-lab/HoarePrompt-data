To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
- `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(13):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(13)` will iterate 13 times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = 12`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be reset to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range is valid, which it always is (since `range(13)` will always produce 13 iterations).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Reset `i` to 0**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to adjust the initial state to set `i` to 0.
- **Ensure `n` is Non-Negative**: The value of `n` must be non-negative, but this is already given in the state.
- **Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` should remain as described, with each key associated with a list of 13 values, and the values should be `True` or `None` as specified.
- **Next Element `k`**: The value of `k` should be the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.**
