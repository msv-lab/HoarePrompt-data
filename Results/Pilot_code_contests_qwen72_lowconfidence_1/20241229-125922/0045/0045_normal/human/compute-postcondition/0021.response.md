The code snippet provided prints a formatted string using the current values of `k` and `i`. It does not alter the values of `n`, `i`, or the dictionary `d`. Therefore, the only effect is the printing of the string.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, and `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop does not continue to the next iteration. '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) is printed.**
