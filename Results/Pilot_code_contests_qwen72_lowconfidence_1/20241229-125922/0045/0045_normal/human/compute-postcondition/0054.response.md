Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values, `k` is 'H', `d['H'][1]` is falsy. If `d[k][i]` is truthy, the program will skip the rest of the current iteration if this code is within a loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statements.***
