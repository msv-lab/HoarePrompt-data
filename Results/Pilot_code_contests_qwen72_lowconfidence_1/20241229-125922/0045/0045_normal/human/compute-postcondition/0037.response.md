To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values.
- If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`.
- If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`.
- If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
- If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`.
- The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) has been printed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(13):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `d` is a dictionary with the specified structure.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to 12 (inclusive).

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

3. **Dictionary `d`**:
   - The value of `d[k][i]` needs to be checked again.
   - If `d[k][i]` is `True`, it remains `True`.
   - If `d[k][i]` is `None`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) will be printed with the updated values of `k` and `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `d` remains the same structure, but `d[k][i]` needs to be checked again.
- If `d[k][i]` is `None`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', each associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, `k` is set to the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. The string '%s %d' % (k, i + 1) has been printed.**
