The code snippet prints the current value of `k` followed by the value of `i + 1`. It does not modify any variables or the dictionary `d`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. If `d[k][i]` is `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `True`, and `d` retains its structure as described in the precondition. If `d[k][i]` is not `True`, then `d[k][i]` remains `None`. `k` is the next element in the list `['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']` after the current `k`. If `n` is 0, `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.**
