You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Taro is going to play a card game. However, now he has only n cards, even though there should be 52 cards (he has no Jokers).

The 52 cards include 13 ranks of each of the four suits: spade, heart, club and diamond.

Note

解説



Input

In the first line, the number of cards n (n ≤ 52) is given.

In the following n lines, data of the n cards are given. Each card is given by a pair of a character and an integer which represent its suit and rank respectively. A suit is represented by 'S', 'H', 'C' and 'D' for spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds respectively. A rank is represented by an integer from 1 to 13.

Output

Print the missing cards. The same as the input format, each card should be printed with a character and an integer separated by a space character in a line. Arrange the missing cards in the following priorities:

* Print cards of spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds in this order.
* If the suits are equal, print cards with lower ranks first.

    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = raw_input().split()
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the function to read input is `input()`. Therefore, the program will not work correctly in Python 3 due to this incompatibility. Additionally, the variable `n` should be converted to an integer using `int(n)` since `input()` returns a string. Without this conversion, the loop `for i in range(n):` will raise a TypeError. Here is the corrected version of the problematic parts:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = input().split()  # Use input() instead of raw_input()
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
```

With these changes, the program would be correct and follow the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by n lines, each containing a string representing a card in the format "<suit> <rank>", where <suit> is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and <rank> is an integer from 1 to 13.
def func():
    n = input()
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = raw_input().split()
        
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. After the loop finishes, for each key `k` in `d` and each index `i` in the range 0 to 12, if `d[k][i]` was initially `None`, the string `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` has been printed. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged, preserving its structure and values as described in the initial state. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
