Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Type of `n`**: 
   - In the program, `n` is read using `input()`, which returns a string. However, the program treats `n` as an integer in the `for` loop. To fix this, `n` should be converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since the problem description does not specify the version of Python, it is safer to assume Python 3, which is more commonly used today.

3. **Handling of Missing Cards**:
   - The program correctly identifies and prints the missing cards in the required order (spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds, and then by rank). However, the use of `None` to mark missing cards and `True` to mark present cards is unconventional. It would be clearer to use a boolean value (`False` for missing, `True` for present).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    d = {'S': [False] * 13, 'H': [False] * 13, 'C': [False] * 13, 'D': [False] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = input().split()
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
    
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if not d[k][i]:
                print(f'{k} {i + 1}')
```

### Why the Corrected Program is Correct:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of cards `n` as an integer and then reads the card details as strings.
- **Data Structure**: The dictionary `d` is used to track the presence of each card, with `False` indicating a missing card and `True` indicating a present card.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the missing cards in the required order (spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds, and then by rank).

By addressing these issues, the program now fully meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
