Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input is provided in Python 3. The function uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments, making it incorrect according to the problem description, which assumes valid input but does not specify the Python version. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not work in every potential case.
