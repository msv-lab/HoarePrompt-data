Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the function to read input is `input()`. Therefore, the program will not work correctly in Python 3 due to this incompatibility. Additionally, the variable `n` should be converted to an integer using `int(n)` since `input()` returns a string. Without this conversion, the loop `for i in range(n):` will raise a TypeError. Here is the corrected version of the problematic parts:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = input().split()  # Use input() instead of raw_input()
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
```

With these changes, the program would be correct and follow the problem description for every potential case.
