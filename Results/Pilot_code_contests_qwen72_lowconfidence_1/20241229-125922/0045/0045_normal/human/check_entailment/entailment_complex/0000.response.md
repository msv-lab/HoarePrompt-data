Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment, which is the more commonly used version today.

2. **Type Conversion for `n`**:
   - The variable `n` is read using `input()`, but it is not converted to an integer. This means `n` is a string, and the subsequent loop `for i in range(n):` will raise a `TypeError` because `range()` expects an integer.

3. **Handling of Missing Cards**:
   - The program correctly marks the presence of cards in the dictionary `d` and prints the missing cards. However, the use of `None` as the initial value in the dictionary lists and `True` to mark the presence of cards is unconventional. It would be more intuitive to use `False` and `True` for clarity.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())  # Convert input to integer
    d = {'S': [False] * 13, 'H': [False] * 13, 'C': [False] * 13, 'D': [False] * 13}
    
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = input().split()
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
    
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if not d[k][i]:
                print(f'{k} {i + 1}')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: `n` is converted to an integer using `int(input())`.
- **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with `False` values, indicating that no cards are initially present.
- **Marking Presence**: The presence of each card is marked by setting the corresponding entry in the dictionary to `True`.
- **Printing Missing Cards**: The program iterates over the dictionary and prints the missing cards in the required order.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not meet the problem description due to the issues mentioned. The corrected program, however, correctly implements the requirements and should be considered correct. Therefore, the original program is **False**.
