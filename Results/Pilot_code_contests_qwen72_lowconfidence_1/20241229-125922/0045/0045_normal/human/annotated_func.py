#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by n lines, each containing a string representing a card in the format "<suit> <rank>", where <suit> is one of 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D' and <rank> is an integer from 1 to 13.
def func():
    n = input()
    d = {'S': [None] * 13, 'H': [None] * 13, 'C': [None] * 13, 'D': [None] * 13}
    for i in range(n):
        x, y = raw_input().split()
        
        d[x][int(y) - 1] = True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values, where `d[x][int(y) - 1]` is `True` for each valid input `(x, y)` provided during the loop, and the rest are `None`. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
    for k in ['S', 'H', 'C', 'D']:
        for i in range(13):
            if d[k][i]:
                continue
            print('%s %d' % (k, i + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `d` is a dictionary with keys 'S', 'H', 'C', 'D', and each key is associated with a list of 13 values. After the loop finishes, for each key `k` in `d` and each index `i` in the range 0 to 12, if `d[k][i]` was initially `None`, the string `'%s %d' % (k, i + 1)` has been printed. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged, preserving its structure and values as described in the initial state. If `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and `d` remains unchanged with all values being `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from stdin, where the first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 52) representing the number of cards Taro has, followed by `n` lines, each containing a string in the format "<suit> <rank>". The function then updates a dictionary `d` to mark the presence of each card. After processing the input, the function prints the missing cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where each card is represented as a string in the format "<suit> <rank>". If `n` is 0, no cards are marked as present, and the function prints all 52 cards. The function does not return any value; it only prints the missing cards to stdout.
