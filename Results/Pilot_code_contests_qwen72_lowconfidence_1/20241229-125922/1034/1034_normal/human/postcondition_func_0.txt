The function `func_1` reads a number `n` from standard input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` from standard input. The function evaluates whether the sum of `n * a` and `b` is at least `S`. If `n * a` is less than `S`, it checks if the remaining value `S - (n * a)` is less than or equal to `b`. If `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`, it checks if the remainder `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`. Based on these conditions, it appends either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` to a result string. After processing all test cases, it writes the result string to standard output. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results are printed to standard output, with each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`.
