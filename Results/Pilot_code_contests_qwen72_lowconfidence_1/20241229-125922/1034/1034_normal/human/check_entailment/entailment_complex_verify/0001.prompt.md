You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a coins of value n and b coins of value 1. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such x and y that if you take x (0 ≤ x ≤ a) coins of value n and y (0 ≤ y ≤ b) coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S.

You have to answer q independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then q test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains four integers a, b, n and S (1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins of value n, the number of coins of value 1, the value n and the required total value.

Output

For the i-th test case print the answer on it — YES (without quotes) if there exist such x and y that if you take x coins of value n and y coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 6
5 2 6 27
3 3 5 18


Output


YES
NO
NO
YES
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = stdin.readline()
    res = ''
    for x in range(int(n)):
        (a, b, n, S) = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
        prod = n * a
        if n * a < S:
            if S - prod <= b:
                res += 'YES\n'
            else:
                res += 'NO\n'
        elif S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
    stdout.write(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `if n * a < S:`. This condition is checking if the total value of all coins of value `n` is less than `S`, which is not always the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach should involve checking if there exists a combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * n + y = S` and `0 <= x <= a` and `0 <= y <= b`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2 1 3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, we have 2 coins of value 3 and 1 coin of value 1. We need to make a total of 5. The correct combination is taking 1 coin of value 3 and 2 coins of value 1 (since 1 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 5). However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it checks if `3 * 2 < 5`, which is false, and then incorrectly concludes that it cannot form the sum `5`.

To fix this, the program should check if there exists a valid combination of `x` and `y` that satisfies the conditions. A corrected version of the logic would be:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func_1():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    res = ''
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b, n, S) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if S // n <= a and S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
    stdout.write(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from sys import stdin, stdout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4, and each of the q test cases contains four integers a, b, n, and S where 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = stdin.readline()
    res = ''
    for x in range(int(n)):
        a, b, n, S = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
        
        prod = n * a
        
        if n * a < S:
            if S - prod <= b:
                res += 'YES\n'
            else:
                res += 'NO\n'
        elif S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `res` is a string containing `q` lines, each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` based on the conditions evaluated for each of the `q` test cases. For each test case, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` are integers read from input, `prod` is calculated as `n * a`, and the conditions are: if `n * a < S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, or if `n * a ≥ S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, then the line is `'YES\n'`; otherwise, the line is `'NO\n'`.
    stdout.write(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a number `n` from standard input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` from standard input. The function evaluates whether the sum of `n * a` and `b` is at least `S`. If `n * a` is less than `S`, it checks if the remaining value `S - (n * a)` is less than or equal to `b`. If `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`, it checks if the remainder `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`. Based on these conditions, it appends either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` to a result string. After processing all test cases, it writes the result string to standard output. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results are printed to standard output, with each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
