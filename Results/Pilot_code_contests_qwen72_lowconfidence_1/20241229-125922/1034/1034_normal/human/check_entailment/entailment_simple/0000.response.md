Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called at the beginning of the script, but it is not defined until after the call. This will cause a runtime error because the function is not yet defined when it is called.
   - The input handling inside `func_1()` is incorrect. The variable `n` should be renamed to `q` to match the problem description, which specifies that `q` is the number of test cases.

2. **Logic Errors:**
   - The logic for determining whether there exist `x` and `y` such that `x * n + y = S` is flawed. The current implementation checks if `n * a < S` and then if `S - prod <= b`, but this does not cover all possible cases.
   - The condition `if n * a < S:` is not necessary. The correct approach is to check if there exists a non-negative integer `x` such that `x * n + y = S` and `0 ≤ x ≤ a` and `0 ≤ y ≤ b`.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct approach is to check if there exists an integer `x` such that `0 ≤ x ≤ a` and `0 ≤ S - x * n ≤ b`. This can be simplified to checking if `S % n <= b` and `S // n <= a`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func_1():
    q = int(stdin.readline())
    res = ''
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b, n, S = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if S % n <= b and S // n <= a:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
    
    stdout.write(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case.
- **Condition Check:** For each test case, it checks if `S % n <= b` and `S // n <= a`. If both conditions are true, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

This corrected program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
