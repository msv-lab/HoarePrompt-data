You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a coins of value n and b coins of value 1. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such x and y that if you take x (0 ≤ x ≤ a) coins of value n and y (0 ≤ y ≤ b) coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S.

You have to answer q independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then q test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains four integers a, b, n and S (1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins of value n, the number of coins of value 1, the value n and the required total value.

Output

For the i-th test case print the answer on it — YES (without quotes) if there exist such x and y that if you take x coins of value n and y coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 6
5 2 6 27
3 3 5 18


Output


YES
NO
NO
YES
Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = stdin.readline()
    res = ''
    for x in range(int(n)):
        (a, b, n, S) = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
        prod = n * a
        if n * a < S:
            if S - prod <= b:
                res += 'YES\n'
            else:
                res += 'NO\n'
        elif S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
    stdout.write(res)


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` reads a number `n` from standard input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` from standard input. The function evaluates whether the sum of `n * a` and `b` is at least `S`. If `n * a` is less than `S`, it checks if the remaining value `S - (n * a)` is less than or equal to `b`. If `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`, it checks if the remainder `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`. Based on these conditions, it appends either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` to a result string. After processing all test cases, it writes the result string to standard output. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results are printed to standard output, with each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
