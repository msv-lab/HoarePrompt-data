You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have a coins of value n and b coins of value 1. You always pay in exact change, so you want to know if there exist such x and y that if you take x (0 ≤ x ≤ a) coins of value n and y (0 ≤ y ≤ b) coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S.

You have to answer q independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then q test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains four integers a, b, n and S (1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins of value n, the number of coins of value 1, the value n and the required total value.

Output

For the i-th test case print the answer on it — YES (without quotes) if there exist such x and y that if you take x coins of value n and y coins of value 1, then the total value of taken coins will be S, and NO otherwise.

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Example

Input


4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 6
5 2 6 27
3 3 5 18


Output


YES
NO
NO
YES
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin, stdout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4, and each of the q test cases contains four integers a, b, n, and S where 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n = stdin.readline()
    res = ''
    for x in range(int(n)):
        a, b, n, S = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
        
        prod = n * a
        
        if n * a < S:
            if S - prod <= b:
                res += 'YES\n'
            else:
                res += 'NO\n'
        elif S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `res` is a string containing `q` lines, each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` based on the conditions evaluated for each of the `q` test cases. For each test case, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` are integers read from input, `prod` is calculated as `n * a`, and the conditions are: if `n * a < S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, or if `n * a ≥ S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, then the line is `'YES\n'`; otherwise, the line is `'NO\n'`.
    stdout.write(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a number `n` from standard input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` from standard input. The function evaluates whether the sum of `n * a` and `b` is at least `S`. If `n * a` is less than `S`, it checks if the remaining value `S - (n * a)` is less than or equal to `b`. If `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`, it checks if the remainder `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`. Based on these conditions, it appends either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` to a result string. After processing all test cases, it writes the result string to standard output. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results are printed to standard output, with each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
