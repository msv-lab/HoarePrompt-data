Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `if n * a < S:`. This condition is checking if the total value of all coins of value `n` is less than `S`, which is not always the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach should involve checking if there exists a combination of `x` and `y` such that `x * n + y = S` and `0 <= x <= a` and `0 <= y <= b`.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
1
2 1 3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, we have 2 coins of value 3 and 1 coin of value 1. We need to make a total of 5. The correct combination is taking 1 coin of value 3 and 2 coins of value 1 (since 1 * 3 + 2 * 1 = 5). However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it checks if `3 * 2 < 5`, which is false, and then incorrectly concludes that it cannot form the sum `5`.

To fix this, the program should check if there exists a valid combination of `x` and `y` that satisfies the conditions. A corrected version of the logic would be:

```python
from sys import stdin, stdout

def func_1():
    n = int(stdin.readline())
    res = ''
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b, n, S) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if S // n <= a and S % n <= b:
            res += 'YES\n'
        else:
            res += 'NO\n'
    stdout.write(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases.
