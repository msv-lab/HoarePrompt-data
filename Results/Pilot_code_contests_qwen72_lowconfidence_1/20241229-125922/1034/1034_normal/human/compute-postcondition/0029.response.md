The provided Python code reads four integers (`a`, `b`, `n`, and `S`) from the standard input and assigns them to the respective variables. This operation does not affect the values of `q`, `x`, `prod`, or `res`.

- `q` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4.
- `x` remains 2.
- `prod` remains `n * a`.
- `res` remains the same based on the conditions described.

The new values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` are the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` remains the same based on the conditions described.**
