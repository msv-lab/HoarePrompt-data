Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, and `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`. Additionally, `S % n` is greater than `b`.***
