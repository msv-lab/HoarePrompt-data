The code snippet `res += 'NO\n'` appends the string `'NO\n'` to the existing value of `res`. Given the initial conditions, `res` can be one of the following strings based on the conditions provided:

- `'YES\n'`
- `'NO\n'`

After executing `res += 'NO\n'`, the value of `res` will be updated accordingly. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

- If `res` was `'YES\n'`, after the operation, `res` will be `'YES\nNO\n'`.
- If `res` was `'NO\n'`, after the operation, `res` will be `'NO\nNO\n'`.

The other variables (`q`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `S`, `x`, `prod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 1, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` is either `'YES\nNO\n'` or `'NO\nNO\n'`**
