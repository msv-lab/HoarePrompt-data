The line of code `res += 'NO\n'` appends the string `'NO\n'` to the variable `res`. Given that `res` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `res` will be equal to `'NO\n'`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is `'NO\n'`, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, and `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`. Additionally, `S % n` is greater than `b`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is `'NO\n'`, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, and `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`. Additionally, `S % n` is greater than `b`.**
