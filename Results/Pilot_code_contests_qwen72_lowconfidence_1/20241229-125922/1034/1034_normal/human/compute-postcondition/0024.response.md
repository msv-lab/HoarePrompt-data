The value of `res` is updated by appending the string `'YES\n'` to its current value. Since the initial state specifies conditions under which `res` could be either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`, the new value of `res` will depend on these conditions. However, regardless of the initial value of `res`, the new value of `res` will be the original value plus the appended string `'YES\n'`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 1, `prod` is `n * a`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\nYES\n'`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\nYES\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\nYES\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\nYES\n'`.**
