The code snippet reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` respectively. The values of `q`, `x`, and `prod` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `res` are still based on the new values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 1, `prod` is `n * a`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`.**
