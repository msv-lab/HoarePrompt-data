Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`. If `n * a < S`, then if `S - prod` ≤ `b`, `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with `'YES\n'`. Otherwise, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `'NO\n'`. If `n * a ≥ S`, then if `S % n` ≤ `b`, `res` is updated to include `'YES\n'` appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `res` is updated to include `'NO\n'` appended to its previous value.***
