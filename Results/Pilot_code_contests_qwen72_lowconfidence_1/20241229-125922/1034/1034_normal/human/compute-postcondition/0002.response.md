To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the `for` loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for x in range(int(n)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `int(n)` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be a positive integer.
2. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4.
   - Each of the `q` test cases contains four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` where 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `n`, `S` ≤ 10^9.
   - `res` is an empty string.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check `n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 1 and 10^9, this condition is satisfied.
2. **Initialize `x`**: The variable `x` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`q`, `a`, `b`, `S`, and `res`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
Given that `n` is already a positive integer, the only adjustment needed is to initialize `x` to 0, which is done implicitly by the `range` function.

State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 10^9, `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 10^9, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `S` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 10^9, `res` is an empty string, `x` is 0**
