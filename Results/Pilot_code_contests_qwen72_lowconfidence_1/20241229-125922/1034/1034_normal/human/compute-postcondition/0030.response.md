The line of code `prod = n * a` is already present in the initial state, which means the value of `prod` is set to `n * a`. Since this operation does not change from the initial state, no additional changes occur.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` remains the same based on the conditions described.**
