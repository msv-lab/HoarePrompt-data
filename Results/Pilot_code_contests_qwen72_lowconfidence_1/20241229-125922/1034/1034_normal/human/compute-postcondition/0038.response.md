Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `res` is a string containing `q` lines, each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` based on the conditions evaluated for each of the `q` test cases. For each test case, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` are integers read from input, `prod` is calculated as `n * a`, and the conditions are: if `n * a < S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, or if `n * a ≥ S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, then the line is `'YES\n'`; otherwise, the line is `'NO\n'`.**
