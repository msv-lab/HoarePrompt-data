The line of code `prod = n * a` recalculates the value of `prod` based on the current values of `n` and `a`. Since the initial state already defines `prod` as `n * a`, this calculation does not change the value of `prod`. The conditions and values for `q`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `S`, `x`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 1, `prod` is `n * a`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`.**
