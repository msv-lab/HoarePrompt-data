Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `prod` is `n * a`, and `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`. If `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. Otherwise, `res` is `'NO\n'`. In both cases, `x` remains 0.***
