The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept multiple parameters to process the described inputs. Specifically, the function needs to handle `q` test cases, each consisting of four integers: `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S`.

Therefore, the function likely accepts these parameters in some form, possibly as a list of tuples or individual parameters. For simplicity, let's assume it accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four integers (a, b, n, S) with 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**

However, since the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, I will assume the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case. The exact nature of the result (e.g., a boolean, an integer, a string) is not specified, so I'll keep it general.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four integers (a, b, n, S) with 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
