The line of code `res += 'NO\n'` appends the string `'NO\n'` to the variable `res`. Since `res` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `res` will contain the string `'NO\n'`. No other variables are directly modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `res` while keeping all other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is `'NO\n'`, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, the value of `n * a` is less than `S`, and `S - prod > b`**
