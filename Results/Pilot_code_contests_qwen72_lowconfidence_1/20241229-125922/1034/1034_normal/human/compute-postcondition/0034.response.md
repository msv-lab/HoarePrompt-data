The code snippet `res += 'YES\n'` appends the string `'YES\n'` to the variable `res`. This operation modifies the value of `res`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` is updated to include `'YES\n'` appended to its previous value.**
