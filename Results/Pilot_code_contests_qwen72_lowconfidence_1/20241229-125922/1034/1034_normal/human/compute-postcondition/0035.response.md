The line of code `res += 'NO\n'` appends the string `'NO\n'` to the variable `res`. This impacts the value of `res` by extending its current content.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `q` â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` is `res` appended with `'NO\n'`.**
