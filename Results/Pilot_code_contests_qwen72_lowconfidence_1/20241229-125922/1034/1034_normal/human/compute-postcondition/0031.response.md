The line of code `res += 'YES\n'` appends the string `'YES\n'` to the variable `res`. This operation modifies the value of `res`.

Initial State:
- `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4
- `a` is an integer read from input
- `b` is an integer read from input
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `S` is an integer read from input
- `x` is 2
- `prod` is `n * a`
- `res` remains the same based on the conditions described

After executing `res += 'YES\n'`:
- `res` is updated to its previous value concatenated with `'YES\n'`

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with `'YES\n'`.**
