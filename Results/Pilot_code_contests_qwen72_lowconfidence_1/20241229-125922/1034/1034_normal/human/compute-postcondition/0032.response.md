The line of code `res += 'NO\n'` appends the string `'NO\n'` to the existing value of `res`. This operation modifies the value of `res` while leaving all other variables unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 2, `prod` is `n * a`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `'NO\n'`.**
