The code snippet reads a line from standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation changes the value of `n` from its initial state, which was part of the initial conditions for the q test cases, to the value read from the input.

The other variables (`q`, `a`, `b`, `S`) and their constraints remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: q is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4, and each of the q test cases contains four integers a, b, n, and S where 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9, **`n` is now the input line read from stdin**.

Output State: **q is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^4, and each of the q test cases contains four integers a, b, n, and S where 1 ≤ a, b, n, S ≤ 10^9, `n` is now the input line read from stdin**.
