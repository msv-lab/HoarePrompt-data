Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a number `n` from standard input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` from standard input. The function evaluates whether the sum of `n * a` and `b` is at least `S`. If `n * a` is less than `S`, it checks if the remaining value `S - (n * a)` is less than or equal to `b`. If `n * a` is greater than or equal to `S`, it checks if the remainder `S % n` is less than or equal to `b`. Based on these conditions, it appends either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'` to a result string. After processing all test cases, it writes the result string to standard output. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results are printed to standard output, with each line being either `'YES\n'` or `'NO\n'`. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case:** If `S` is exactly equal to `n * a`, the function should still return `'YES\n'` because the condition `S % n <= b` will always be true (since `S % n` will be 0).
- **Missing Functionality:** The function assumes that `n` is always a valid positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function will raise an error when attempting to convert it to an integer or iterate over the range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is malformed or incomplete, which could lead to runtime errors.
