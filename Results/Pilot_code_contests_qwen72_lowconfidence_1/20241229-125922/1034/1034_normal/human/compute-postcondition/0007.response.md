The code appends the string `'YES\n'` to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables (`q`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `S`, `x`, `prod`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is `'YES\n'`, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, and the value of `n * a` is less than `S`. Additionally, the difference between `S` and `prod` (i.e., `S - prod`) is less than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is `'YES\n'`, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`, and the value of `n * a` is less than `S`. Additionally, the difference between `S` and `prod` (i.e., `S - prod`) is less than or equal to `b`.**
