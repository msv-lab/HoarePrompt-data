Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 0, and `prod` is `n * a`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` < `S` and `S - prod` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` ≤ `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. If `n * a` ≥ `S` and `S % n` > `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`.***
