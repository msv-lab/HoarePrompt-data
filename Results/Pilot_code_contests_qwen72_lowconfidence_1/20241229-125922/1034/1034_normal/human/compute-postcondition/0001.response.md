The code initializes an empty string `res`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `S`. The value of `n` is read from the standard input, but this action is not part of the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change in the state is the initialization of `res`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, and each of the `q` test cases contains four integers `a`, `b`, `n`, and `S` where 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `n`, `S` ≤ 10^9, `res` is an empty string**.
