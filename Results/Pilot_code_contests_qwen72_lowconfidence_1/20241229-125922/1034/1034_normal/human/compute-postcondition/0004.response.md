The code snippet `prod = n * a` calculates the product of the variables `n` and `a`, and assigns the result to the variable `prod`. 

Given the initial state:
- `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4
- `a` is an integer read from input
- `b` is an integer read from input
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `S` is an integer read from input
- `res` is an empty string
- `x` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the value of `prod` is updated to `n * a`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `res` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `prod` is `n * a`**
