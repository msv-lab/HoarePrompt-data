Postcondition: ***`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `S` is an integer read from input, `x` is 0, and `prod` is `n * a` where `n * a` is less than `S`. If `S - prod` is less than or equal to `b`, `res` is `'YES\n'`. Otherwise, if `S - prod` is greater than `b`, `res` is `'NO\n'`.***
