Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the sequence of bosses starts with an easy boss (a_1 = 0). In such cases, the initial assignment `F[0] = A[0]` will set `F[0]` to 0, which is incorrect because the first session is always your friend's session, and if the first boss is easy, no skip points should be used initially. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
0 1 0
```
The expected output should be 0 because your friend can kill the first boss (which is easy) without using any skip points, and you can kill the remaining bosses. However, the program will incorrectly compute the result as 1.
