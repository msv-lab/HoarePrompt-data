Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the issue lies in how the dynamic programming arrays `F` and `M` are initialized and updated, which can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Initialization and Update of `F` and `M`:**
   - The initialization of `F[0]` and `F[1]` is done without considering the dynamic nature of the problem. For example, if the first two elements are both hard bosses (`A[0] = 1` and `A[1] = 1`), the current logic does not correctly handle the scenario where your friend can kill both bosses in one session using only one skip point.
   - The update of `F[i]` and `M[i]` does not correctly account for the possibility of your friend killing two bosses in one session. Specifically, the cost calculation `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])` does not consider the optimal way to minimize skip points.

### Example Case:
Consider the test case:
```
n = 4
A = [1, 1, 0, 1]
```
- According to the problem, the optimal solution would be:
  - Friend kills the first two bosses using 1 skip point.
  - You kill the third boss.
  - Friend kills the fourth boss using 1 skip point.
- The total skip points needed are 2.

However, the provided code might incorrectly calculate the minimum skip points due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in the initialization and update of the dynamic programming arrays. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
