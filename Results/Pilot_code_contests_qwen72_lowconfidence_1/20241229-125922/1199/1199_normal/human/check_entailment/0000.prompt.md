You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.

During one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.

Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.

Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

For example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:

  * your friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; 
  * you kill the third and the fourth bosses; 
  * your friend kills the fifth boss; 
  * you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses; 
  * your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i is the type of the i-th boss.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(raw_input())
        A = map(int, raw_input().split())
        A.reverse()
        F = [0] * n
        M = [0] * n
        F[0] = A[0]
        if n == 1:
            print(F[0])
            continue
        F[1] = A[1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])
            F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
        print(F[-1])


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
