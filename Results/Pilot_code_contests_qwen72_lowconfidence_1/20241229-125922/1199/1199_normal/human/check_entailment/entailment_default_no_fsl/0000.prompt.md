You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.

During one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.

Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.

Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

For example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:

  * your friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; 
  * you kill the third and the fourth bosses; 
  * your friend kills the fifth boss; 
  * you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses; 
  * your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i is the type of the i-th boss.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(raw_input())
        A = map(int, raw_input().split())
        A.reverse()
        F = [0] * n
        M = [0] * n
        F[0] = A[0]
        if n == 1:
            print(F[0])
            continue
        F[1] = A[1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])
            F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
        print(F[-1])


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each one. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers (each being 0 or 1). The function calculates the minimum cost to traverse the list from the start to the end, where the cost of moving to the next element is determined by the values in the list. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `A` is a list of the last input integers in reversed order, `F` and `M` are lists of length `n` used for dynamic programming calculations, and the results for each test case have been printed. Edge cases include when `n` is 1, in which case the function directly prints the first element of `A`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
