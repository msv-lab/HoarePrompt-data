You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.

During one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.

Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.

Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

For example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:

  * your friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; 
  * you kill the third and the fourth bosses; 
  * your friend kills the fifth boss; 
  * you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses; 
  * your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i is the type of the i-th boss.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i is either 0 or 1. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(raw_input())
        
        A = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        A.reverse()
        
        F = [0] * n
        
        M = [0] * n
        
        F[0] = A[0]
        
        if n == 1:
            print(F[0])
            continue
        
        F[1] = A[1]
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])
            F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
        
        print(F[-1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the last input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. For each iteration of the loop, the value of `F[-1]` has been printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
