Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of bosses `n` and the list of boss types `A`.

2. **Reversing the List:**
   - The list `A` is reversed. This is a crucial step because the dynamic programming solution is designed to work from the end of the list to the beginning. Reversing the list allows the program to handle the sessions in the correct order (friend's session first, followed by yours).

3. **Dynamic Programming Arrays:**
   - `F` is an array where `F[i]` represents the minimum number of skip points needed to kill the first `i+1` bosses.
   - `M` is an auxiliary array used to store the minimum skip points required to reach the current boss from the previous one or two bosses.

4. **Initialization:**
   - `F[0]` is set to `A[0]` because the first boss is handled in the first session.
   - `F[1]` is set to `A[1]` because the second boss is handled in the second session.

5. **Dynamic Programming Loop:**
   - For each boss from the third to the last, the program calculates the minimum skip points needed to kill the current boss and the previous one or two bosses.
   - The formula `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])` ensures that the minimum skip points are used by considering both the current boss and the previous one or two bosses.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints `F[-1]`, which is the minimum number of skip points needed to kill all the bosses.

### Why It Works:
- The program correctly handles the alternating sessions between you and your friend.
- The dynamic programming approach ensures that the minimum skip points are used by considering the optimal way to kill the current boss and the previous one or two bosses.
- The reversal of the list `A` ensures that the sessions are handled in the correct order, starting with your friend's session.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 1`. In this case, the minimum skip points needed is simply `A[0]`.
- The program also handles larger test cases efficiently due to the dynamic programming approach, which has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
