Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the first boss is easy (a_1 = 0) and the second boss is hard (a_2 = 1). According to the problem statement, the first session is always your friend's session, and your friend cannot kill a hard boss without a skip point. However, the program initializes `F[1] = A[1]`, which means it assumes the second boss can be killed without a skip point if it is hard. This is incorrect because your friend would need a skip point to kill the second boss if it is hard.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
1
2
0 1
```
In this case, the first boss is easy, and the second boss is hard. The correct output should be `1` because your friend needs one skip point to kill the second boss. However, the program will output `0`, which is incorrect.
