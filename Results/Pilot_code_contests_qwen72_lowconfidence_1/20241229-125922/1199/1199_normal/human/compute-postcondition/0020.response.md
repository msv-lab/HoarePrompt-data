The code `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[4]` to the minimum of `F[3]` and `F[2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, and `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)` and `M[3]` which is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `i` is 4

The specific values of `F[2]` and `F[3]` are:
- `F[2]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence.
- `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`.

Thus, the value of `M[4]` is updated to the minimum of `F[2]` and `F[3]`.
