To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions that determine whether the loop will run. Specifically, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts from 0)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `t` is within the specified range. The other variables (`n` and `a`) are not directly relevant to the initial execution of the loop, but they will be used within the loop body.
