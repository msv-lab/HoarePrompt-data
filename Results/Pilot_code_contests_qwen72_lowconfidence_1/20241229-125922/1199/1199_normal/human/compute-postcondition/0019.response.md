To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - The first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence
  - The second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence
  - `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
- `M` is a list of length `n` with:
  - All elements initialized to 0 except:
    - `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`
    - `M[3]` which is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `i` is 3

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 4, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, and `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)` and `M[3]` which is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, `i` is 4**
