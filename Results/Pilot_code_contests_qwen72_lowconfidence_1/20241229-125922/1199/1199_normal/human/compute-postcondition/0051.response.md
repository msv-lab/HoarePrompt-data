The code snippet `M = [0] * n` initializes the list `M` with `n` zeros. This overrides any previous values that `M` might have had. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `A`, `F`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[0]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` has been printed.**
