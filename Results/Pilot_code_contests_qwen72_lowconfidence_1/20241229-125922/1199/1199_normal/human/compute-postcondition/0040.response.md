The code snippet updates the value of `F[i]` based on the given formula. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `i` is currently 3.
2. The formula for updating `F[i]` is:
   ```
   F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
   ```
3. Substituting `i` with 3:
   ```
   F[3] = min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])
   ```
4. According to the initial state, `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`. However, this information is not directly used in the calculation of `F[3]`.
5. The values of `A[3]`, `A[2]`, `M[2]`, and `M[1]` are not specified in the initial state, but they are required to compute `F[3]`.

Since the values of `A[3]`, `A[2]`, `M[2]`, and `M[1]` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `F[3]`. However, we can describe the updated state as follows:

- `i` remains 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.
- `M[3]` is still the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`.
- `F[3]` is now computed as `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again, `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`, `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`**.
