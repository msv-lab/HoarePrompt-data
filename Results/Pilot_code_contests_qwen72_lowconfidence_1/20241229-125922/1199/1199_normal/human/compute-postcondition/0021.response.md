The code updates the value of `F[i]` where `i` is 4. The new value of `F[4]` is calculated as the minimum of `A[4] + M[3]` and `A[4] + A[3] + M[2]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, and `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`, `M[3]` which is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, and `M[4]` which is `min(F[2], F[3])`
- `i` is 4

The calculation for `F[4]` is:
- `F[4] = min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])`

Since `M[3]` is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])` and `M[2]` is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`:
