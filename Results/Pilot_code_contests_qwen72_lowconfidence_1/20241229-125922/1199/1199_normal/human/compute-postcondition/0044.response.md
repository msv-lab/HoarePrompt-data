To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop updates the variables `F` and `M`. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0.
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.
- If `n` == 1, `F[0]` has been printed, and we move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])
    F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `F[0] = A[0]`
   - `F[1] = A[1]`
   - `M` is initially `[0] * n`

2. **First Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - `M[2] = min(F[1], F[0]) = min(A[1], A[0])`
   - `F[2] = min(A[2] + M[1], A[2] + A[1] + M[0]) = min(A[2] + 0, A[2] + A[1] + 0) = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - `M[3] = min(F[2], F[1]) = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
   - `F[3] = min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1]) = min(A[3] + min(A[1], A[0]), A[3] + A[2] + 0)`

4. **General Iteration (i > 2)**:
   - `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`
   - `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- **`_`**: Remains 1.
- **`n`**: Is an input integer.
- **`A`**: Is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order.
- **`F`**: After the loop finishes, `F` will be a list of length `n` where:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - For `i` in range(2, n), `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`
- **`M`**: After the loop finishes, `M` will be a list of length `n` where:
  - For `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`
  - `M[0]` and `M[1]` remain 0.

### Special Case:
- If `n == 1`, `F[0]` is printed, and the loop does not execute. Therefore:
  - `F` remains `[A[0]]`
  - `M` remains `[0]`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`, and `M[0]` and `M[1]` are 0. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`.**
