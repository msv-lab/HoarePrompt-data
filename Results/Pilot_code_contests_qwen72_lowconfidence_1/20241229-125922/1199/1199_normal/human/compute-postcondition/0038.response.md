To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
  - The rest of the elements are 0.
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, with `M[2] = min(A[1], A[0])`.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, with `M[2] = min(A[1], A[0])`, `i` is 3**
