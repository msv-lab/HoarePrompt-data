To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the changes that occur between iterations. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by the variable `t` and the loop variable `_`. The loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `t`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` with specific values calculated based on `A`.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` with specific values calculated based on `F`.
   - The value of `F[-1]` has been printed.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `A`, `F`, `M`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop (as per the given information).

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `_` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i]` is `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`**.
