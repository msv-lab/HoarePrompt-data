The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` to the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 2.
- `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest are initialized to 0.
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0.

The code updates `M[2]` to the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[0]`. Since `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, `M[2]` will be set to `min(A[0], A[1])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-2)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`, `i` is 2**
