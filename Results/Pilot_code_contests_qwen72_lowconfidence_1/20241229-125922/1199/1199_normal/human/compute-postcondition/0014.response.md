The code `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` to the minimum of the values at indices `i-1` and `i-2` of the list `F`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0
- `i` is 2

We need to compute `M[2]` which is `min(F[1], F[0])`.

Let's denote the last element of the original input sequence as `last_element` and the second element of the reversed input sequence as `second_reversed_element`.

Given:
- `F[0] = last_element`
- `F[1] = second_reversed_element`

Thus:
- `M[2] = min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`, `i` is 2**
