The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` to the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is now 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

We can deduce the following:

- Since `i` is 3, the code will set `M[3]` to the minimum of `F[2]` and `F[1]`.
- The values of `F[1]` and `F[2]` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `M[3]`. However, we know that `M[3]` will be the smaller of `F[1]` and `F[2]`.

The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again, `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`**
