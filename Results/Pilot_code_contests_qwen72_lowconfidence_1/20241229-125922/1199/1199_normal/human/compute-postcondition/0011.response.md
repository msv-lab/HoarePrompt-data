Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If `n` is 1, the value of `F[0]` has been printed.***
