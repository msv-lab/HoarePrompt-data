The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` based on the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
  - `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
  - `F[4] = 0`
  - The rest initialized to `[0] * (n-5)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with:
  - `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`
  - `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `i` is 4

The code updates `M[4]` to the minimum of `F[3]` and `F[2]`.

Let's compute `F[2]` and `F[3]`:
- `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
- `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`

Now, `M[4]` will be:
- `M[4] = min(F[3], F[2])`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
  - `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
  - `F[4] = 0`
  - The rest initialized to `[0] * (n-5)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with:
  - `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`
  - `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
  - `M[4] = min(F[3], F[2])`
- `i` is 4

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`, `F[4] = 0`, the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-5)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`, `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, `M[4] = min(F[3], F[2])`, `i` is 4**
