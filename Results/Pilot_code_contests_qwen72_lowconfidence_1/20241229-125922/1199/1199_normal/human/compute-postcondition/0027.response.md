The code snippet `A.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the list `A`. Since `A` was initially a map object containing integers from the input line in the order they were provided, after reversing, the elements in `A` will now be in the reverse order.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the order they are provided
- `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i]` is `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`
- `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`

After executing the code snippet `A.reverse()`, the state changes as follows:
- The elements in `A` are now in reverse order.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `F`, `M`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the reverse order they are provided, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i]` is `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`**
