To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. Let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-2)`.
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.
- If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`.
- The value of `F[-1]` has been printed, and if `n == 1`, the value of `A[0]` has also been printed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will execute if the range `range(2, n)` is non-empty.
- For the range `range(2, n)` to be non-empty, `n` must be greater than 2.
- The loop variable `i` will start at 2 and iterate up to `n-1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- The loop variable `i` should be initialized to 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `A`, `F`, `M`) should remain as they are, but their values should be consistent with the conditions given.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-2)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `i` is 2**.
