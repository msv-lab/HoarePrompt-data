Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the last input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. For each iteration of the loop, the value of `F[-1]` has been printed.**
