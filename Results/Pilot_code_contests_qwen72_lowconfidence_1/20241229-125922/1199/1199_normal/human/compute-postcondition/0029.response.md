The code snippet `M = [0] * n` initializes the list `M` to a list of zeros with a length of `n`. This overrides the previous definition of `M`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the reverse order they are provided, `F` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the reverse order they are provided, `F` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`**
