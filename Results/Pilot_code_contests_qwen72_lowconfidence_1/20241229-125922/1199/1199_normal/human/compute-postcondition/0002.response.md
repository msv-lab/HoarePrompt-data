The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and `_` is 0. After executing the code, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
