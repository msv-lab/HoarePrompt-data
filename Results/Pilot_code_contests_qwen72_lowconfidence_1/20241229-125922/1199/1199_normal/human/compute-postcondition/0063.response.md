To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
  - `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
  - The rest initialized to `[0] * (n-4)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with:
  - `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`
  - `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `i` is 3

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains the same: 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` remains the same: 2
- `n` remains the same: an input integer greater than 3
- `A` remains the same: a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` remains the same: a list of length `n` with the specified initial values and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-4)`
- `M` remains the same: a list of length `n` with the specified initial values and the rest initialized to `[0] * n`
- `i` is incremented to 4

Thus, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`, and `F[4] = 0`, the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-5)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])` and `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, `i` is 4**
