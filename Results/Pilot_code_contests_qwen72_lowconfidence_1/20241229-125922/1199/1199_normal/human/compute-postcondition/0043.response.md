The given Python code snippet computes the value of `F[i]` using the formula:

```
F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again
- `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`
- `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`
- `M[4]` is `min(F[3], F[2])`
- `F[4]` is yet to be computed

We substitute `i` with 4 in the code snippet:

```
F[4] = min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])
```

Now, let's list the impact of this code on the program:

1. **`F[4]`** is computed using the given formula.
2. The values of `A[4]`, `M[3]`, and `M[2]` are used in the computation.
3. The value of `F[4]` is the minimum of two expressions:
   - `A[4] + M[3]`
   - `A[4] + A[3] + M[2]`

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again
- `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`
- `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`
- `M[4]` is `min(F[3], F[2])`
- `F[4]` is `min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])`

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again, `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`, `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`, `M[4]` is `min(F[3], F[2])`, `F[4]` is `min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])`**
