To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-3)`.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - The loop condition requires that `i < n`. Since `n` is greater than 2, and `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - No other variables need to be adjusted based on the given loop structure and current state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-3)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`, `i` is 3**
