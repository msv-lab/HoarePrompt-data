The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of lists `a` (where each inner list represents a test case). Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a` for that test case, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` is either 0 or 1. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

The function's output is not specified in the provided context, but typically, such functions process the input test cases and return a result for each test case. Without more specific details on the expected output, we can only infer that the function processes the given test cases and returns some form of result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `a`, where each inner list `a` contains `n` integers (each being 0 or 1) for each test case. The function processes these test cases and returns results for each test case.**
