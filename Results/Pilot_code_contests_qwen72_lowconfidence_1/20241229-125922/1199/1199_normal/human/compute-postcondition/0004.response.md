The code snippet `A.reverse()` reverses the elements in the map object `A`. Since the exact contents of `A` are not specified, we can only say that the order of the elements in `A` is reversed.

Other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order**
