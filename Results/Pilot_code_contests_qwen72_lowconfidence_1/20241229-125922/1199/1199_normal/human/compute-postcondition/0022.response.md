Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i]` is `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `M` remains a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
