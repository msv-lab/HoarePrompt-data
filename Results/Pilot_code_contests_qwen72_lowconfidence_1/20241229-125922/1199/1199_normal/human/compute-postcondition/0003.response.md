The code snippet `A = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting iterable to the variable `A`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line**
