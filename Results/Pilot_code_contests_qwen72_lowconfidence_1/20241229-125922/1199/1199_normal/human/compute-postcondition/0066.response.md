To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the final values of the variables based on the loop's behavior. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-2)`.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(2, n)`.
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - `M[i]` is set to the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`.
     - `F[i]` is set to the minimum of `A[i] + M[i - 1]` and `A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop iterates from 2 to `n - 1`.
   - `F` will be fully populated with values up to `F[n-1]`.
   - `M` will be fully populated with values up to `M[n-1]`.

4. **Values of Variables**:
   - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` remains 2.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `A` remains a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` where:
     - `F[0] = A[0]`
     - `F[1] = A[1]`
     - For `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `F[i]` is the minimum of `A[i] + M[i - 1]` and `A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2]`.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` where:
     - For `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `M[i]` is the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`.

5. **Special Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the loop does not execute, and `F` remains `[A[0]]` and `M` remains `[0]`.

Given this analysis, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `F[i]` is the minimum of `A[i] + M[i - 1]` and `A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2]`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `M[i]` is the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`.**
