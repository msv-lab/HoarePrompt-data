The code snippet updates the value of `F[i]` using the formula `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
   - `M[3]` is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`.

2. **Evaluating the Code**:
   - `F[i]` is updated to `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`.
   - For `i = 3`, this becomes `F[3] = min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`.
   - Since `M[1]` is 0 (as all elements of `M` are 0 except `M[2]`), the expression simplifies to `F[3] = min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2])`.

3. **Substituting Known Values**:
   - `M[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
   - Therefore, `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - `F[3]` is now set to the minimum of `A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])` and `A[3] + A[2]`.

5. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, and `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)` and `M[3]` which is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, `i` is 3.**
