Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-1)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`
- If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`
- The value of `F[-1]` has been printed

Code Snippet:
```
print(F[0])
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

- The value of `F[0]` is printed. Since `F[0] = A[0]`, the value of `A[0]` is printed.
- No other variables are changed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-1)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` has been printed, and the value of `A[0]` has been printed.**
