Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-1)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` has been printed, and if `n == 1`, the value of `A[0]` has also been printed.***
