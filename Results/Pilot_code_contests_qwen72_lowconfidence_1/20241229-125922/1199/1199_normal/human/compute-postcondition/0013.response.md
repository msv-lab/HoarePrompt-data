To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence.
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will execute if the range `2` to `n` (exclusive) contains at least one integer. This means `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `i` will start at 2 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

### States to Adjust:
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will start at 2.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `A`, `F`, `M`) do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 2**.
