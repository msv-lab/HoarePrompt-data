The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` based on the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-3)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`
- `i` is 3

Let's evaluate the impact of the code:

1. **`M[i]` Calculation**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `M[3]` will be assigned the minimum of `F[2]` and `F[1]`.
   - `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
   - `F[1]` is `A[1]`.

2. **Evaluate `M[3]`**:
   - `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`.

The updated state will be:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-3)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])` and `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `i` is 3

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`, and the rest initialized to `[0] * (n-3)`, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])` and `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`, `i` is 3**.
