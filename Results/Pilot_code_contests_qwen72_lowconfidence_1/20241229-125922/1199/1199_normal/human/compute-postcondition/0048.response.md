The code snippet provided updates the value of `A` by reading an input line and converting it into a map object containing integers in reverse order.

- The initial state specifies that `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order. The new line of code redefines `A` based on a new input.
- The input is split by spaces and each part is converted to an integer, then mapped into `A`.
- Since the input is read again, the previous content of `A` (if any) is overwritten.

Given this, the updated state of `A` is now a map object containing the integers from the new input line in reverse order. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`, and `M[0]` and `M[1]` are 0. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` has been printed.**
