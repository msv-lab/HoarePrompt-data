To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and initial state:

- The loop `for i in range(2, n):` will only execute if `n` is greater than 2. This is because the range function generates numbers starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`. If `n` is 2 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

- The variable `i` is initialized to 2 at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

- The state before the loop starts includes:
  - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
  - `_` is 1.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order.
  - `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0.
  - `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.
  - If `n` == 1, `F[0]` has been printed, and we move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.

Given these conditions, the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `i` is 2**.
