The code snippet updates the value of `M[i]` to be the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3.
- `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
- `M[2]` is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`.

Let's calculate the new value of `M[3]`:

1. `F[2]` is already given as `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
2. `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, which is `A[1]`.
3. `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, which is `A[0]`.

The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` translates to `M[3] = min(F[2], F[1])`.

Given the initial state:
- `F[1]` is `A[1]`.
- `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.

Therefore, `M[3]` is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`.

The output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence.
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`.
- `i` is 3.
- `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.
- `M[3]` is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`.
