The code snippet `F[0] = A[0]` assigns the first element of the map object `A` (which contains integers in reverse order from the input line) to the first position of the list `F`.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` remains 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `A` remains a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order.
- `F` was initially a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`. After the execution, the first element of `F` is updated to the first element of `A`.
- `M` remains a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`**.
