The code snippet updates the value of `F[i]` using the formula `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`. Given the initial state, we can calculate the new value of `F[i]`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with:
  - `F[0] = A[0]`
  - `F[1] = A[1]`
  - `F[2] = min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`
  - `F[3] = min(A[3] + min(A[0], A[1]), A[3] + A[2])`
  - `F[4] = 0`
  - The rest initialized to `[0] * (n-5)`
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n` with:
  - `M[2] = min(A[0], A[1])`
  - `M[3] = min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
  - `M[4] = min(F[3], F[2])`
- `i` is 4

### Code Execution:
```python
F[i] = min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])
```

### Calculation:
- `i` is 4
- `A[4]` is the fourth element in the map object `A`
- `M[3]` is `min(min(A[2], A[2] + A[1]), A[1])`
- `M[2]` is `min(A[0], A[1])`
- `A[3]` is the third element in the map object `A`

The new value of `F[4]` is calculated as:
- `F[4] = min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])`

### Updated State:
- `F[4]` is now `min(A[4] + M[3], A[4] + A[3] + M[2])`
- All other variables remain unchanged.
