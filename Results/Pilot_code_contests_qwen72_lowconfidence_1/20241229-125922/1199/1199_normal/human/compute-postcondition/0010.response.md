The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end, and the control flow skips to the next iteration of the loop (if within a loop). Since no loop is explicitly mentioned in the context provided, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure. However, without the loop context, the statement itself does not alter any variable values.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged from the Initial State, except that the `continue` statement indicates that the next iteration of the enclosing loop (if any) should begin immediately.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is 1, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. The value of `F[0]` has been printed.**
