The code snippet initializes the list `F` to be a list of zeros of length `n`. This changes the previous definition of `F` which was described as having specific values based on the input sequence and the map object `A`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the reverse order they are provided, `F` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`**
