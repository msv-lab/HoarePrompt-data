The code snippet `F[1] = A[1]` assigns the value of `A[1]` to the second element of the list `F`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4 (unchanged).
- `_` is 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order (unchanged).
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence.
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 (unchanged).

Since `F[1]` is being updated with the value of `A[1]`, we need to consider the value of `A[1]`. The value of `A[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
- `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence.
- `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
