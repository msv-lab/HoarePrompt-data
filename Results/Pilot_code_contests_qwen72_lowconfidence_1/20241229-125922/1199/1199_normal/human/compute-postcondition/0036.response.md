The code snippet `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])` updates the value of `M[i]` based on the minimum of the two preceding elements in the list `F`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`
- `i` is 2

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 2.
2. `M[i]` is updated to the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`.
3. `F[i - 1]` is `F[1]`, which is `A[1]`.
4. `F[i - 2]` is `F[0]`, which is `A[0]`.

Thus, `M[2]` is set to `min(A[1], A[0])`.

The output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order
- `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, with `M[2] = min(A[1], A[0])`
- `i` is 2

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and `F[1] = A[1]`, and the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, with `M[2] = min(A[1], A[0])`, `i` is 2**
