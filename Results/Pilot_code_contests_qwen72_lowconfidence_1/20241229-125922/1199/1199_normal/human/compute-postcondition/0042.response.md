Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again
- `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`
- `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`
- `F[4]` is yet to be computed

Code Snippet:
```
M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code updates the value of `M[i]` to be the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`.
   - Since `i` is 4, `M[4]` will be set to the minimum of `F[3]` and `F[2]`.

2. **Previous Values of Affected Variables:**
   - `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`
   - `F[2]` is already known from the previous iterations (though its exact value is not provided).

3. **Calculation of the Result:**
   - `M[4]` will be set to `min(F[3], F[2])`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again
- `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`
- `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`
- `M[4]` is `min(F[3], F[2])`
- `F[4]` is yet to be computed

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again, `M[3]` is the minimum of `F[1]` and `F[2]`, `F[3]` is `min(A[3] + M[2], A[3] + A[2] + M[1])`, `M[4]` is `min(F[3], F[2])`, and `F[4]` is yet to be computed.**
