The code snippet `F = [0] * n` initializes the list `F` with `n` zeros. This overrides any previous values that `F` might have had. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `A`, `M`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` in range(2, n), `M[i] = min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`, and `M[0]` and `M[1]` are 0. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[0]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` has been printed.**
