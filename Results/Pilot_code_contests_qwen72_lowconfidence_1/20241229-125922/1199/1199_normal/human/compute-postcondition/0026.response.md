The provided code snippet updates the variable `A` to be a map object that contains integers from the input line, split by spaces. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `F`, or `M`.

The new value of `A` is a map object that iterates over the integers read from the input line, in the order they are provided (not reversed, contrary to what was stated in the initial state).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in the order they are provided, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0]` is the last element of the original input sequence, `F[1]` is the second element of the reversed input sequence, and for `i` in range(2, n), `F[i]` is `min(A[i] + M[i - 1], A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2])`, `M` is a list of length `n` where `M[i]` for `i` in range(2, n) is `min(F[i - 1], F[i - 2])`**
