Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`. If `n` == 1, `F[0]` has been printed, and we move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.***
