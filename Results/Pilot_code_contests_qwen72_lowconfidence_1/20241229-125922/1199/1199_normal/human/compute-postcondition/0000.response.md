`t` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and this condition remains valid after the assignment. The other conditions regarding `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
