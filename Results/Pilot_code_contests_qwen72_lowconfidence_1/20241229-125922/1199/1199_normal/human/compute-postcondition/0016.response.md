To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Current State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order.
   - `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence.
   - `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for i in range(2, n):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 2 and ending at `n-1`.
   - At the end of the current iteration (where `i` is 2), the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `_`, `A`, `F`, and `M` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the loop control structure.

Given these steps, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with the first element initialized to the last element of the original input sequence and the second element initialized to the second element of the reversed input sequence, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `M[2]` which is `min(last_element, second_reversed_element)`, `i` is 3, `F[2]` is `min(A[2], A[2] + A[1])`**
