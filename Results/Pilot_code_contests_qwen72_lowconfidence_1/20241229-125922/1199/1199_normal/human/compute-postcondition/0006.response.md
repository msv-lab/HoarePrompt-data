The code initializes a new list `M` of length `n`, with all elements set to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `A`, and `F` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `M` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
