The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since this is a standalone `continue` statement, it implies that there must be a loop (like a `for` or `while` loop) enclosing this statement. However, without the context of the loop, we can only infer that the loop's current iteration is skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.

The values of the variables do not change, but the program control moves to the next iteration of the enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reverse order, `F` is a list of length `n` with `F[0] = A[0]` and the rest elements are 0, `M` is a list of length `n` initialized to `[0] * n`, `F[0]` has been printed, and we move to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.**
