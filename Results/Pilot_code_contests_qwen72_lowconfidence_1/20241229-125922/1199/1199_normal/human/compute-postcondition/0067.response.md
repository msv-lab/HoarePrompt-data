The code prints the last element of the list `F`. This impacts the program by displaying the value of `F[-1]` but does not alter any variables or the state of the program.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order
- `F` is a list of length `n` initialized based on the rules provided
- `M` is a list of length `n` initialized based on the rules provided

After executing `print(F[-1])`, the output state remains the same, except the value of `F[-1]` is printed. The variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the new input line in the original order, `F` is a list of length `n` where `F[0] = A[0]`, `F[1] = A[1]`, and for `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `F[i]` is the minimum of `A[i] + M[i - 1]` and `A[i] + A[i - 1] + M[i - 2]`, `M` is a list of length `n` where for `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `M[i]` is the minimum of `F[i - 1]` and `F[i - 2]`. If `n == 1`, `F` is `[A[0]]` and `M` is `[0]`. The value of `F[-1]` is printed.**
