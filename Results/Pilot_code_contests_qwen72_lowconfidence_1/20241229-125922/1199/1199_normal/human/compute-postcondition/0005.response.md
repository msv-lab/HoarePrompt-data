The code initializes a list `F` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The initial state includes `t` being an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` being 0, `n` being an input integer, and `A` being a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order. After executing the code, the only change is the creation and initialization of the list `F`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a map object containing integers from the input line in reversed order, `F` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0.**
