You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are n bosses in this tower, numbered from 1 to n. The type of the i-th boss is a_i. If the i-th boss is easy then its type is a_i = 0, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is a_i = 1.

During one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.

Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.

Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.

For example: suppose n = 8, a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]. Then the best course of action is the following:

  * your friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; 
  * you kill the third and the fourth bosses; 
  * your friend kills the fifth boss; 
  * you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses; 
  * your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. 



You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1), where a_i is the type of the i-th boss.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 (∑ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).

Output

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all n bosses in the given order.
