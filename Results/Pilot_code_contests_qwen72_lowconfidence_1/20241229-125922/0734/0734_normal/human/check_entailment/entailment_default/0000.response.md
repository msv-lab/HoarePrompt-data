Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the binary search implementation in `func_1` has a flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Binary Search Implementation in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`.
   - The binary search loop terminates when `l + 1 < r`, but the condition inside the loop `if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0` is not always correctly handled.
   - For example, when `c` is 0 and `d` is non-zero, the function should return 0, but the current implementation may return an incorrect value because the condition `mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0` simplifies to `- (n - mid) * d >= 0`, which is always false for `mid < n`.

2. **Edge Case Analysis**:
   - When `c` is 0 and `d` is non-zero, the function should return 0, but the current implementation may return a different value.
   - When `d` is 0 and `c` is non-zero, the function should return `n`, but the current implementation may return a different value.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if there exists an integer `i` such that `ll <= dd <= rr`, where `ll = i * c - (n - i) * d` and `rr = i * d - (n - i) * c`.
   - The logic is generally correct, but the incorrect value of `l` returned by `func_1` can lead to incorrect results in the main loop.

Given these issues, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, particularly in edge cases involving `c` and `d` being zero. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
