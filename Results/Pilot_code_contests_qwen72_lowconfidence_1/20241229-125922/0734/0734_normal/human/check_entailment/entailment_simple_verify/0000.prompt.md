You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares in a row. The leftmost square contains the integer A, and the rightmost contains the integer B. The other squares are empty.

Aohashi would like to fill the empty squares with integers so that the following condition is satisfied:

* For any two adjacent squares, the (absolute) difference of the two integers in those squares is between C and D (inclusive).



As long as the condition is satisfied, it is allowed to use arbitrarily large or small integers to fill the squares. Determine whether it is possible to fill the squares under the condition.

Constraints

* 3 \leq N \leq 500000
* 0 \leq A \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq B \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq C \leq D \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B C D


Output

Print `YES` if it is possible to fill the squares under the condition; print `NO` otherwise.

Program:
```
(n, a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
dd = b - a
if dd < 0:
    dd = -dd
l = func_1(n, c, d)
ok = False
for i in range(l, n + 1):
    ll = i * c - (n - i) * d
    rr = i * d - (n - i) * c
    if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
        ok = True
    if ll > dd:
        break
if ok:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(n, c, d):
    l = -1
    r = n
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
    return r


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to fill the squares such that the absolute difference between any two adjacent squares is between \(C\) and \(D\) (inclusive). The program uses a binary search-like approach in `func_1` to find the minimum number of steps required to achieve the desired difference. It then checks all possible values within this range to see if the absolute difference between the first and last elements can be achieved. The logic ensures that all edge cases and constraints are handled correctly, and the program produces the correct output for all provided examples and potential edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
dd = b - a
if dd < 0:
    dd = -dd
l = func_1(n, c, d)
ok = False
for i in range(l, n + 1):
    ll = i * c - (n - i) * d
    rr = i * d - (n - i) * c
    if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
        ok = True
    if ll > dd:
        break
if ok:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, c and d are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d):
    l = -1
    r = n
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        
        if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is the largest integer such that `l * c - (n - l) * d < 0`, `r` is the smallest integer such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`, `mid` is no longer relevant as the loop has terminated, `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` remain integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
    return r
    #The program returns `r`, which is the smallest integer such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. Here, `r` is determined based on the initial conditions where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
