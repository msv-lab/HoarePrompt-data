Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it fails to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments, which are more commonly used today.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the binary search implementation is not correctly handling the condition to find the smallest `r`.

3. **Incorrect Range in the Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over `i` from `l` to `n + 1`. However, the range should be from `0` to `n-1` because the indices of the squares range from `0` to `n-1`. The current range might lead to incorrect results or out-of-bounds errors.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of `ll` and `rr`**:
   - The calculations for `ll` and `rr` are incorrect. The correct formula for `ll` should be `i * c - (n - 1 - i) * d` and for `rr` should be `i * d - (n - 1 - i) * c`. The current formulas might not correctly represent the minimum and maximum possible values for the absolute difference between the values in the squares.

5. **Early Break Condition**:
   - The condition `if ll > dd:` is used to break the loop early. However, this might prematurely terminate the loop, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should meet the problem description:

```python
def solve(n, a, b, c, d):
    dd = abs(b - a)
    for i in range(n):
        ll = i * c - (n - 1 - i) * d
        rr = i * d - (n - 1 - i) * c
        if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

# Read input
n, a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())

# Solve and print result
print(solve(n, a, b, c, d))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading**: Uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
- **Absolute Difference Calculation**: Correctly calculates the absolute difference `dd`.
- **Loop Range**: Iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1` to cover all possible positions.
- **Correct Formulas**: Uses the correct formulas for `ll` and `rr` to ensure the absolute difference condition is met.
- **Result**: Returns 'YES' if the condition is met for any `i`, otherwise returns 'NO'.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
