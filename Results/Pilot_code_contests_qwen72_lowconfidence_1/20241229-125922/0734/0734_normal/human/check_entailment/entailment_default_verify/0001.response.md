Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the program is correct, and based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, this assessment is accurate. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the input values `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using `raw_input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is consistent with the problem constraints and input format.

2. **Absolute Difference Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the absolute difference `dd` between `a` and `b` using `dd = abs(b - a)`. This ensures that the program handles both positive and negative differences.

3. **Binary Search Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. This is crucial for determining the range of possible values for `i` in the main loop.
   - The binary search approach is efficient and correctly handles edge cases such as when `c` is 0 or `d` is 0. For example, if `c` is 0, `r` will always be 0, and if `d` is 0, `r` will be `n`.

4. **Main Loop and Condition Checking**:
   - The program iterates over the range `[l, n]` (where `l` is the result of `func_1`) and checks if there exists an `i` such that the condition `ll <= dd <= rr` holds, where:
     - `ll = i * c - (n - i) * d`
     - `rr = i * d - (n - i) * c`
   - If such an `i` is found, the program prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases, including when `c` is 0 or `d` is 0, as mentioned in the output hints.
   - The constraints and input format are respected, and the program does not assume invalid inputs.

Given the above points, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is accurate.
