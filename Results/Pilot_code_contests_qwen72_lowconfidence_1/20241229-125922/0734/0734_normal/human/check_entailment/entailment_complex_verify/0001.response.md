Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The annotated version of the code provides a detailed explanation of the program's state at different points, which aligns with the original assessment and the problem description. Here's a systematic evaluation based on the annotations and the original assessment:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using `raw_input().split()` and `map(int, ...)`.
   - The constraints are respected, and the input values are validated by the problem description.

2. **Absolute Difference Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the absolute difference `dd` between `a` and `b` using a simple if-else statement to handle both positive and negative differences. This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum i**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the smallest value of `i` such that the expression `i * c - (n - i) * d` is non-negative.
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies the smallest `i` that satisfies the condition. This is crucial for the main loop to check the validity of the solution.

4. **Checking Validity**:
   - The main loop iterates over the range `[l, n]` and calculates `ll` and `rr` for each `i`.
   - The program checks if `ll <= dd <= rr` and sets `ok` to `True` if the condition is met.
   - The loop breaks early if `ll > dd`, optimizing the search.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `YES` if a valid `i` is found and `NO` otherwise.
   - This output is consistent with the problem requirements.

The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state at each step and adheres to the problem constraints. The binary search and the main loop logic are sound and correctly implemented. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct is accurate. The program meets the problem description and handles all edge cases effectively.

Thus, the final assessment remains **True**.
