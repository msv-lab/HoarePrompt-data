You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares in a row. The leftmost square contains the integer A, and the rightmost contains the integer B. The other squares are empty.

Aohashi would like to fill the empty squares with integers so that the following condition is satisfied:

* For any two adjacent squares, the (absolute) difference of the two integers in those squares is between C and D (inclusive).



As long as the condition is satisfied, it is allowed to use arbitrarily large or small integers to fill the squares. Determine whether it is possible to fill the squares under the condition.

Constraints

* 3 \leq N \leq 500000
* 0 \leq A \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq B \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq C \leq D \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B C D


Output

Print `YES` if it is possible to fill the squares under the condition; print `NO` otherwise.

Examples

Program:
```
(n, a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
dd = b - a
if dd < 0:
    dd = -dd
l = func_1(n, c, d)
ok = False
for i in range(l, n + 1):
    ll = i * c - (n - i) * d
    rr = i * d - (n - i) * c
    if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
        ok = True
    if ll > dd:
        break
if ok:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(n, c, d):
    l = -1
    r = n
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
    return r


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
