Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly solves the problem described. Let's break down the key components and logic to ensure it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   ```python
   (n, a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
   ```
   This line reads the input and splits it into the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The constraints are assumed to be valid as per the problem description.

2. **Absolute Difference Calculation:**
   ```python
   dd = b - a
   if dd < 0:
       dd = -dd
   ```
   This calculates the absolute difference `dd` between the integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Binary Search Function:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, c, d):
       l = -1
       r = n
       while l + 1 < r:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
               r = mid
           else:
               l = mid
       return r
   ```
   This function performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. This is used to determine the minimum number of steps needed to achieve the required difference.

4. **Main Logic:**
   ```python
   l = func_1(n, c, d)
   ok = False
   for i in range(l, n + 1):
       ll = i * c - (n - i) * d
       rr = i * d - (n - i) * c
       if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
           ok = True
       if ll > dd:
           break
   if ok:
       print('YES')
   else:
       print('NO')
   ```
   - The variable `l` is the result of the binary search, representing the smallest number of steps needed.
   - The loop iterates from `l` to `n`, calculating the possible range of differences `ll` and `rr` for each step.
   - If the absolute difference `dd` falls within the range `[ll, rr]`, it sets `ok` to `True`.
   - If `ll` exceeds `dd`, the loop breaks early, optimizing the search.
   - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Constraints Handling:** The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description, ensuring that all input values are within the valid ranges.
- **Binary Search Efficiency:** The binary search function efficiently finds the minimum number of steps needed, which is crucial for handling large inputs (`n` up to 500,000).
- **Range Calculation:** The main logic correctly calculates the possible range of differences for each step, ensuring that the solution checks all necessary conditions.
- **Optimization:** The loop breaks early if the calculated lower bound `ll` exceeds the absolute difference `dd`, making the program more efficient.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
