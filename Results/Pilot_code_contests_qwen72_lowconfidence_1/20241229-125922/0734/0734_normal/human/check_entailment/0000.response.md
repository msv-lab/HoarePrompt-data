Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to fill the squares such that the absolute difference between any two adjacent squares is between \(C\) and \(D\) (inclusive). The program uses a binary search-like approach in `func_1` to find the minimum number of steps required to achieve the desired difference. It then checks all possible values within this range to see if the absolute difference between the first and last elements can be achieved. The logic ensures that all edge cases and constraints are handled correctly, and the program produces the correct output for all provided examples and potential edge cases.
