Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It checks if it's possible to fill the squares such that the absolute difference between any two adjacent squares is within the specified range [C, D]. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` using `raw_input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem constraints.

2. **Absolute Difference Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference `dd` between the values `a` and `b` to ensure it handles both positive and negative differences.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum i**: The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the minimum value of `i` such that the expression `i * c - (n - i) * d` is non-negative. This helps in determining the range of possible values for `i`.

4. **Checking Validity**: The program iterates over the range `[l, n]` (where `l` is the result of `func_1`) and checks if there exists an `i` such that the condition `ll <= dd <= rr` holds, where `ll` and `rr` are calculated as follows:
   - `ll = i * c - (n - i) * d`
   - `rr = i * d - (n - i) * c`

5. **Output**: If a valid `i` is found, the program prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. It ensures that the absolute difference between adjacent squares is within the specified range [C, D] for all possible values of `i` in the range `[l, n]`.

Since the program meets all the requirements and constraints for every potential case, it is correct.
