You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N squares in a row. The leftmost square contains the integer A, and the rightmost contains the integer B. The other squares are empty.

Aohashi would like to fill the empty squares with integers so that the following condition is satisfied:

* For any two adjacent squares, the (absolute) difference of the two integers in those squares is between C and D (inclusive).



As long as the condition is satisfied, it is allowed to use arbitrarily large or small integers to fill the squares. Determine whether it is possible to fill the squares under the condition.

Constraints

* 3 \leq N \leq 500000
* 0 \leq A \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq B \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq C \leq D \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B C D


Output

Print `YES` if it is possible to fill the squares under the condition; print `NO` otherwise.

Output

YES
Program:
```
(n, a, b, c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
dd = b - a
if dd < 0:
    dd = -dd
l = func_1(n, c, d)
ok = False
for i in range(l, n + 1):
    ll = i * c - (n - i) * d
    rr = i * d - (n - i) * c
    if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:
        ok = True
    if ll > dd:
        break
if ok:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(n, c, d):
    l = -1
    r = n
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
    return r


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9. It returns the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. The function uses a binary search approach to find this value of `r`. After the function concludes, `r` is the smallest integer satisfying the condition, and the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `c` is 0, in which case `r` will always be 0, and when `d` is 0, in which case `r` will be `n`.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
