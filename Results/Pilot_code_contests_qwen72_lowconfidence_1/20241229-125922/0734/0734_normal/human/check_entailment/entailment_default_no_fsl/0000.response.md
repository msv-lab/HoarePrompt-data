Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail in environments where Python 3 is used, which is more common today.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_1` is intended to find the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. However, the implementation of the binary search might not handle edge cases correctly, particularly when `c` or `d` are zero. For example, if `c` is 0, the loop condition `mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0` will never be true unless `d` is also 0, leading to an incorrect value of `r`.

3. **Range Check in Main Loop**: The main loop iterates over `i` from `l` to `n + 1`, but the condition `if ll <= dd and rr >= dd:` might not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the calculation of `ll` and `rr` assumes that the range `[ll, rr]` will always cover the possible values of `dd`, but this might not be true for all inputs, especially when `c` or `d` are very small or zero.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where `c` or `d` are zero, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, if `c` is 0 and `d` is non-zero, the program might incorrectly conclude that a solution exists when it does not.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
