#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, c and d are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, c, d):
    l = -1
    r = n
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) / 2
        
        if mid * c - (n - mid) * d >= 0:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `l` is the largest integer such that `l * c - (n - l) * d < 0`, `r` is the smallest integer such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`, `mid` is no longer relevant as the loop has terminated, `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` remain integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
    return r
    #The program returns `r`, which is the smallest integer such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. Here, `r` is determined based on the initial conditions where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9. It returns the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. The function uses a binary search approach to find this value of `r`. After the function concludes, `r` is the smallest integer satisfying the condition, and the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `c` is 0, in which case `r` will always be 0, and when `d` is 0, in which case `r` will be `n`.
