The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9. It returns the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`. The function uses a binary search approach to find this value of `r`. After the function concludes, `r` is the smallest integer satisfying the condition, and the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. Edge cases include when `c` is 0, in which case `r` will always be 0, and when `d` is 0, in which case `r` will be `n`.
