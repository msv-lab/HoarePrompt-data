You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are N squares in a row. The leftmost square contains the integer A, and the rightmost contains the integer B. The other squares are empty.

Aohashi would like to fill the empty squares with integers so that the following condition is satisfied:

* For any two adjacent squares, the (absolute) difference of the two integers in those squares is between C and D (inclusive).



As long as the condition is satisfied, it is allowed to use arbitrarily large or small integers to fill the squares. Determine whether it is possible to fill the squares under the condition.

Constraints

* 3 \leq N \leq 500000
* 0 \leq A \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq B \leq 10^9
* 0 \leq C \leq D \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N A B C D


Output

Print `YES` if it is possible to fill the squares under the condition; print `NO` otherwise.
