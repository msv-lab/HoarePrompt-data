The value of `l` is updated to `mid`. The initial value of `mid` is calculated as `(-1 + n) / 2`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `mid` will also be a floating-point number. However, since `l` is an integer, `mid` should be cast to an integer when assigning to `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `l = (-1 + n) // 2`, `r = n`, `mid = (-1 + n) / 2`, and `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d < 0)`**
