Output State: **`l` is the largest integer such that `l * c - (n - l) * d < 0`, `r` is the smallest integer such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`, `mid` is no longer relevant as the loop has terminated, `n` remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` remain integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9.**
