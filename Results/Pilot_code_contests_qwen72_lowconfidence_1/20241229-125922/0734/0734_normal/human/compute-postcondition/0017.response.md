The value of `l` is updated to the current value of `mid`. The value of `mid` depends on the condition `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0`. If the condition is true, `mid = (n - 7) / 8`. If the condition is false, `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- If `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0`, then `l = (n - 7) / 8`, `r = (n - 3) / 4`, and `mid = (n - 7) / 8`
- Otherwise, `l = (3 * n - 1) / 4`, `r = n`, and `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9, if `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0`, then `l = (n - 7) / 8`, `r = (n - 3) / 4`, and `mid = (n - 7) / 8`; otherwise, `l = (3 * n - 1) / 4`, `r = n`, and `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`**
