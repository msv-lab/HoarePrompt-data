The value of `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) / 2`. Given that `l = -1` and `r = n`, the value of `mid` becomes `(-1 + n) / 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `n`, `c`, or `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `l = -1`, `r = n`, `mid = (-1 + n) / 2`**
