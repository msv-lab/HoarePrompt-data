The code snippet `l = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `l`. We need to consider the two possible conditions for `mid` based on the initial state:

1. If `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0`, then:
   - `l = -1`
   - `r = (-1 + n) / 2`
   - `mid = (n - 3) / 4`

2. Otherwise:
   - `l = (-1 + n) // 2`
   - `r = n`
   - `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`

In both cases, the value of `mid` is used to update `l`.

### Case 1: `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0`
- `mid = (n - 3) / 4`
- `l` is updated to `(n - 3) / 4`

### Case 2: `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) < 0`
- `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`
- `l` is updated to `(3 * n - 1) / 4`

Therefore, the output state will depend on which condition is met. However, in both cases, the value of `l` is updated to the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9, if `(mid * c - (n - mid) * d) >= 0` then `l = (n - 3) / 4`, `r = (-1 + n) / 2`, and `mid = (n - 3) / 4`, otherwise `l = (3 * n - 1) / 4`, `r = n`, and `mid = (3 * n - 1) / 4`.**
