The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `c`, and `d`. `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9. The function returns the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500000, and `c` and `d` are integers such that 0 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 10^9. It returns the smallest integer `r` such that `r * c - (n - r) * d >= 0`.**
