The code snippet `balls = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `balls`. 

- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
- The variable `t` also remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
- A new variable `balls` is introduced, which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `t` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ ti ≤ n, `balls` is a list of integers from user input**.
