The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through `raw_input()`. Since `n` was initially defined as an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, this constraint should still hold true after the assignment, assuming the input is within the specified range. The list `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 (updated from user input), and t is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ ti ≤ n.**
