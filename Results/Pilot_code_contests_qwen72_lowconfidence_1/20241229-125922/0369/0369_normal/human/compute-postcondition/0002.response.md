The code snippet `domination = (n + 1) * [0]` initializes a new list `domination` with a length of `n + 1`, where each element is initialized to 0.

- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The variable `balls` remains unchanged.
- A new variable `domination` is introduced, which is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `t` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ ti ≤ n, `balls` is a list of integers from user input, `domination` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**.
