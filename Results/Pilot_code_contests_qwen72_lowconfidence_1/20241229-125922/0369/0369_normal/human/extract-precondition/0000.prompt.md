You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Bear Limak has n colored balls, arranged in one long row. Balls are numbered 1 through n, from left to right. There are n possible colors, also numbered 1 through n. The i-th ball has color ti.

For a fixed interval (set of consecutive elements) of balls we can define a dominant color. It's a color occurring the biggest number of times in the interval. In case of a tie between some colors, the one with the smallest number (index) is chosen as dominant.

There are <image> non-empty intervals in total. For each color, your task is to count the number of intervals in which this color is dominant.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of balls.

The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 ≤ ti ≤ n) where ti is the color of the i-th ball.

Output

Print n integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the number of intervals where i is a dominant color.

Examples

Input

4
1 2 1 2


Output

7 3 0 0 


Input

3
1 1 1


Output

6 0 0 

Note

In the first sample, color 2 is dominant in three intervals:

  * An interval [2, 2] contains one ball. This ball's color is 2 so it's clearly a dominant color. 
  * An interval [4, 4] contains one ball, with color 2 again. 
  * An interval [2, 4] contains two balls of color 2 and one ball of color 1. 



There are 7 more intervals and color 1 is dominant in all of them.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
