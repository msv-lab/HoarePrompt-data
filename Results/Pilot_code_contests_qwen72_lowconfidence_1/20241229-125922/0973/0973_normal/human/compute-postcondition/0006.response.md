The code `total.append(str(big))` adds the string representation of the current value of `big` to the list `total`.

- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `big` was previously divided by 2, and its current value is half of the original value.
- `total` initially contained the string representation of the original `big`. After executing the code, `total` now contains two elements: the string representation of the original `big` and the string representation of the current value of `big`.
- `temp` remains unchanged and is still equal to the original value of `big`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` is an input integer, `big` is an input integer and now `big` is equal to `big / 2`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and the string representation of the current `big`, `temp` is equal to the original `big`.**
