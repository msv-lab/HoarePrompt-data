The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `big`. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers with the condition 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9. However, the input operation does not affect the values of `a` and `b` directly. After executing the code, `n` and `big` will hold the values provided by the input, which are integers.

Output State: **a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers**.
