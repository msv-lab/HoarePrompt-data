Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big`. If `big` is even, `big` is updated to `big / 2`, and `total` also contains the string representation of the new `big`. If `big` is odd and `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, then `total` also contains the string representation of `temp`, and `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`. If `big` is odd and `(temp * 10 + 1) != big`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout.***
