The value of `temp` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `big` is an input integer and is guaranteed to be greater than `n`, the condition for `temp` being calculated as `(big - 1) // 10` holds true. The `total` list contains the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, but this specific code snippet does not affect the `total` list.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd)**
