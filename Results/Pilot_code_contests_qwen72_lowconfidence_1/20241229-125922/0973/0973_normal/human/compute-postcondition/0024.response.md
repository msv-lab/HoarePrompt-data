Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout. If `big` is even, `big` is updated to `big / 2` (a floating-point number) and the string representation of the updated `big` is added to `total`. If `big` is odd, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`. If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, then `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10` and the string representation of the updated `big` is added to `total`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
