To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `big > n`.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `big` are input integers.
- `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`.
- `temp` is equal to `big`.

### Condition Analysis:
The loop will execute if `big` is greater than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `big > n` is true for the loop to run at least once.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **No adjustment is needed for `a`, `b`, or `total`** because they do not directly affect the condition `big > n`.
- **`big` and `n` need to be such that `big > n`**. If `big` is not greater than `n`, the loop will not execute.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state does not specify the relationship between `big` and `n`, we need to ensure that `big` is greater than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`, `temp` is equal to `big`**.
