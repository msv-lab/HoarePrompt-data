The code appends the string representation of the current value of `big` to the list `total`. Since `big` was previously divided by 2, the new value of `big` is half of its original value. The string representation of this new value is added to the list `total`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `big` is now `big / 2` (a floating-point number), `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and the updated `big` values, `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout.**
