Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop. If the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`, then the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`. Otherwise, the last element of `total` is not equal to the string representation of `n`.***
