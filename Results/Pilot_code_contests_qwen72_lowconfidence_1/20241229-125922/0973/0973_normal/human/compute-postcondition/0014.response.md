Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`. If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, then `total` also contains the string representation of `temp`, and `big` is now equal to `(big - 1) // 10`. Otherwise, `(temp * 10 + 1) != big`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
