Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values. If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, `total` also contains the string representation of `(big - 1) // 10`, and `big` is now `(big - 1) // 10`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
