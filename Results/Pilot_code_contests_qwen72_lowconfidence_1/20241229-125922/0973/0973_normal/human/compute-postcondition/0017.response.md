The code snippet `big = big / 2` updates the value of `big` to be half of its original value. Since `big` was originally greater than `n` and had to satisfy certain conditions based on whether it was even or odd, the new value of `big` will now be a floating-point number (since division in Python 3 returns a float).

- If `big` was even before the operation, the condition `big / 2 > n` should still hold because `big` was originally more than twice `n`.
- If `big` was odd, the condition `(big - 1) // 10 > n` would have held, but after dividing by 2, this condition might no longer apply in the same way, but the new value of `big` will still be greater than `n`.

The variable `temp` remains unchanged and retains the original value of `big`. The list `total` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `big` is now `big / 2` (a floating-point number), `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout.**
