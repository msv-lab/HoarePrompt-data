The code snippet `total.append(str(big))` appends the string representation of the current value of `big` to the list `total`. Given the initial conditions, `big` has already been updated to `big // 2` and must remain greater than `n`.

Therefore, the updated `big` is appended to the list `total`, which initially contains the string representations of the original `big` and the updated `big`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big`, the updated `big`, and the updated `big` again, `temp` remains equal to the original `big`, `big` is now `big // 2` which is an integer, and `big` must be greater than `n` after the update.**
