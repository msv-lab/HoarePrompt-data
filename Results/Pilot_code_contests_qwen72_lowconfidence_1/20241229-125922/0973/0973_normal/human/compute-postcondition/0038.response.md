The code `sys.stdout.write('NO\n')` writes the string 'NO\n' to the standard output. This operation does not alter the values of any variables in the program state. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop. The last element of `total` is not equal to the string representation of `n`.**
