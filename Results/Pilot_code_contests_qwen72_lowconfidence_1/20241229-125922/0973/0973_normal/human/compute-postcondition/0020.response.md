The code appends the string representation of `temp` to the list `total`. Since `temp` is defined as `(big - 1) // 10`, this value is converted to a string and added to the list `total`.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `big`) remain unchanged, as does the condition that `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd), `total` now includes the string representation of `temp`.**
