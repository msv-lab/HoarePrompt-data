The code snippet initializes a list `total` and assigns it a single element, which is the string representation of the integer `big`.

- `total` is now a list containing one element, which is the string representation of the value of `big`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `big` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`**.
