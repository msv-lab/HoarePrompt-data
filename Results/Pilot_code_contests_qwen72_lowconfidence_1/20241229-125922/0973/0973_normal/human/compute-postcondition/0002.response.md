The code snippet `temp = big` assigns the value of `big` to the variable `temp`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`, `temp` is equal to `big`**.
