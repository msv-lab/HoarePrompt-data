The value of `big` is updated to be equal to `temp`. The value of `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10` from the initial state. Therefore, `big` now holds the value `(big - 1) // 10`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values and the string representation of `(big - 1) // 10`, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` is now `(big - 1) // 10`**
