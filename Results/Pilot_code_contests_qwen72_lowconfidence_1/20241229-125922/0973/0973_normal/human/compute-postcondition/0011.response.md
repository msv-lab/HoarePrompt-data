`big` is assigned the value of `temp`. Given that `temp` is equal to `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` is now equal to `(big - 1) // 10`. The conditions that `1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9`, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big` and the string representation of `temp`, and `big` is odd, remain unchanged. However, the new value of `big` means that `temp * 10 + 1` is no longer necessarily equal to `big` since `big` has been updated.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the old `big` and the string representation of `temp`, `temp` is equal to `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` is now equal to `(big - 1) // 10`**.
