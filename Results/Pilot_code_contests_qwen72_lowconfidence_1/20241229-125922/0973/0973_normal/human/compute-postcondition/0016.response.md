To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can continue. The loop condition is `big > n`.

### Current State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`.
- `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big`.
- If `big` is even, `big` is updated to `big / 2`, and `total` also contains the string representation of the new `big`.
- If `big` is odd and `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, then `total` also contains the string representation of `temp`, and `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`.
- If `big` is odd and `(temp * 10 + 1) != big`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `big > n`.
2. **Update Rules**:
   - If `big` is even, `big` is updated to `big / 2`.
   - If `big` is odd and `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`.
   - If `big` is odd and `(temp * 10 + 1) != big`, the loop breaks.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- **Current `big` Value**: Since `big` is greater than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the updated `big` is still greater than `n` for the next iteration.
- **Even Case**: If `big` is even, it is updated to `big / 2`. For the loop to continue, `big / 2` must be greater than `n`.
- **Odd Case**:
  - If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`. For the loop to continue, `(big - 1) // 10` must be greater than `n`.
  - If `temp * 10 + 1 != big`, the loop breaks, so this case does not affect the continuation of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Even Case**: Ensure that `big / 2 > n`.
- **Odd Case**: Ensure that `(big - 1) // 10 > n`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `big` to ensure that the updated `big` (whether it is `big / 2` or `(big - 1) // 10`) is still greater than `n`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd), `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout.**
