Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
