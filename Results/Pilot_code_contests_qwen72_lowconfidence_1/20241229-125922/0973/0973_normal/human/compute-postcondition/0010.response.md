The code appends the string representation of `temp` to the list `total`. 

- `total` initially contains the string representation of `big`.
- `temp` is calculated as `(big - 1) // 10`.

Since `temp * 10 + 1` is equal to `big`, `temp` can be derived as:

\[ \text{temp} = \frac{\text{big} - 1}{10} \]

Thus, the new element appended to `total` is the string representation of this value.

Therefore, the updated `total` list will contain two elements: the string representation of `big` and the string representation of `temp`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big` and the string representation of `temp`, `temp` is equal to `(big - 1) // 10`, and `big` is odd. Additionally, `temp * 10 + 1` is equal to `big`.**
