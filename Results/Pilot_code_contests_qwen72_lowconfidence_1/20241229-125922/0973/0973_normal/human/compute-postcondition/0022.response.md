The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently executing. However, since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly shown in the provided snippet, we assume the `break` is part of an implied loop or condition from the context. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the flow of the program is altered.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
