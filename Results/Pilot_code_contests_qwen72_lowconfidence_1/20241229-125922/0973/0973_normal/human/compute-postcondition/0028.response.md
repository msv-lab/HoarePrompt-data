The code snippet updates the value of `temp` to `(big - 1) // 10`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, or `total`. However, it changes the value of `temp` based on the current value of `big`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9
- `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`
- `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values
- `temp` remains equal to the original `big` throughout

After executing the code snippet:
- `temp` is now `(big - 1) // 10`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`**
