The code snippet `big = temp` updates the value of `big` to the value of `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` is defined as `(big - 1) // 10`. After this assignment, `big` will take on the value of `temp`.

The conditions in the initial state regarding `a`, `b`, `n`, and `big` remain unchanged, except for the value of `big` itself. The new value of `big` is `(big - 1) // 10`, and this value must still satisfy the condition that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd).

The list `total` now includes the string representation of the new `big` value.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `big` is now `(big - 1) // 10`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and the string representation of the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd).**
