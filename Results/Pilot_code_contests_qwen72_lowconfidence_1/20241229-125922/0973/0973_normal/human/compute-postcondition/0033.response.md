Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big`. If `big` is even, `big` is updated to `big // 2`, the string representation of the updated `big` is added to `total`, and `big` must be greater than `n` after the update. If `big` is odd, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`. If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10`, the string representation of the updated `big` is added to `total`, and `big` must be greater than `n` after the update. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
