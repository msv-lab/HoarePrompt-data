The value of `big` is divided by 2. Since `big` was initially an even number, dividing it by 2 results in an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` is an input integer, `big` is an input integer and now `big` is equal to `big / 2`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big`, `temp` is equal to the original `big`. The current value of `big` is an integer.**
