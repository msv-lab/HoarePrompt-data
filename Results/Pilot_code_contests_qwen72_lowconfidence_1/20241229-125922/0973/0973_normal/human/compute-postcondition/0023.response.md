Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of the original `big` and possibly the updated `big` values, `temp` is `(big - 1) // 10`, `big` must be such that either `big / 2 > n` (if `big` is even) or `(big - 1) // 10 > n` (if `big` is odd). If `temp * 10 + 1 == big`, then `big` is updated to `(big - 1) // 10` and the string representation of the updated `big` is added to `total`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
