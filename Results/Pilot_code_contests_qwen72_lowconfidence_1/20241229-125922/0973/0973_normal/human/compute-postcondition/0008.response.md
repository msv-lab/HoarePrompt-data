The code `temp = (big - 1) // 10` modifies the value of `temp`. Given that `big` is an odd integer greater than `n`, and `temp` was initially equal to `big`, the new value of `temp` will be `(big - 1) // 10`.

Since `big` is odd, `big - 1` is even, and dividing an even number by 10 using integer division (`//`) will result in an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers with `big` greater than `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representation of `big`, `temp` is equal to `(big - 1) // 10`, and `big` is odd.
