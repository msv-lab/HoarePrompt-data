The provided code snippet writes a formatted string to the standard output. This string includes "YES", the length of the `total` list, and the elements of `total` in reverse order, separated by spaces. After executing this code, the state of the variables does not change because the `sys.stdout.write` function only outputs to the console and does not modify any variables.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop. The last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`.**
