You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Vasily has a number a, which he wants to turn into a number b. For this purpose, he can do two types of operations:

  * multiply the current number by 2 (that is, replace the number x by 2·x); 
  * append the digit 1 to the right of current number (that is, replace the number x by 10·x + 1). 



You need to help Vasily to transform the number a into the number b using only the operations described above, or find that it is impossible.

Note that in this task you are not required to minimize the number of operations. It suffices to find any way to transform a into b.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 109) — the number which Vasily has and the number he wants to have.

Output

If there is no way to get b from a, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print three lines. On the first line print "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain single integer k — the length of the transformation sequence. On the third line print the sequence of transformations x1, x2, ..., xk, where:

  * x1 should be equal to a, 
  * xk should be equal to b, 
  * xi should be obtained from xi - 1 using any of two described operations (1 < i ≤ k). 



If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
