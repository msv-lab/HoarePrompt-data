Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle certain cases correctly, specifically when the number `b` cannot be transformed from `a` using the allowed operations. The provided counterexample demonstrates this issue clearly:

**Input:**
```
3 14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
3
14 1 3 
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints a transformation sequence that does not follow the rules specified in the problem description. The sequence `14 -> 1 -> 3` is invalid because the operation to go from 14 to 1 is not allowed (it would require dividing by 14, which is not one of the allowed operations). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

The output hints also confirm that the program generates a sequence starting from `big` and repeatedly applies the operations of dividing by 2 if it is even, or subtracting 1 and dividing by 10 if it is odd, until `big` becomes less than or equal to `n`. However, the program does not correctly validate whether the generated sequence is valid according to the problem constraints, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Thus, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
