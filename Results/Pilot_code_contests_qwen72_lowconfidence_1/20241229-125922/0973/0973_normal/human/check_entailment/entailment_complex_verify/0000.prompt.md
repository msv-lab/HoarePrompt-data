You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasily has a number a, which he wants to turn into a number b. For this purpose, he can do two types of operations:

  * multiply the current number by 2 (that is, replace the number x by 2·x); 
  * append the digit 1 to the right of current number (that is, replace the number x by 10·x + 1). 



You need to help Vasily to transform the number a into the number b using only the operations described above, or find that it is impossible.

Note that in this task you are not required to minimize the number of operations. It suffices to find any way to transform a into b.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 109) — the number which Vasily has and the number he wants to have.

Output

If there is no way to get b from a, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print three lines. On the first line print "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain single integer k — the length of the transformation sequence. On the third line print the sequence of transformations x1, x2, ..., xk, where:

  * x1 should be equal to a, 
  * xk should be equal to b, 
  * xi should be obtained from xi - 1 using any of two described operations (1 < i ≤ k). 



If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big / 2
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            temp = (big - 1) // 10
            if temp * 10 + 1 == big:
                total.append(str(temp))
                big = temp
            else:
                break
    if total[-1] == str(n):
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `b`. According to the problem statement, `a` should be less than `b`, but the program does not check this condition and may produce incorrect output if `n` is greater than `b`.

For example, if the input is:
```
5 2
```
The program will still attempt to run and produce an incorrect output because it does not validate that `a` is less than `b`. This violates the problem description, which states that `1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, big = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [str(big)]
    temp = big
    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big / 2
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            temp = (big - 1) // 10
            if temp * 10 + 1 == big:
                total.append(str(temp))
                big = temp
            else:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop.
    if (total[-1] == str(n)) :
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else :
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop. If the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`, then the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`. Otherwise, the last element of `total` is not equal to the string representation of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `big` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n < big ≤ 10^9`. It then generates a sequence of numbers starting from `big` and repeatedly divides `big` by 2 if it is even, or subtracts 1 and divides by 10 if it is odd, until `big` becomes less than or equal to `n`. The function collects these numbers in a list `total` as their string representations. After the loop, if the last number in the sequence is equal to `n`, it prints "YES" followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in reverse order. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only performs I/O operations. The variables `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations do not appear in the function, and the function does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
