Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle cases where the number `b` cannot be transformed from `a` using the allowed operations. 

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3 14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
3
14 1 3 
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints a transformation sequence that does not follow the rules specified in the problem description. The sequence `14 -> 1 -> 3` is invalid because the operation to go from 14 to 1 is not allowed (it would require dividing by 14, which is not one of the allowed operations). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
