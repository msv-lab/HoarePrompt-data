You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasily has a number a, which he wants to turn into a number b. For this purpose, he can do two types of operations:

  * multiply the current number by 2 (that is, replace the number x by 2·x); 
  * append the digit 1 to the right of current number (that is, replace the number x by 10·x + 1). 



You need to help Vasily to transform the number a into the number b using only the operations described above, or find that it is impossible.

Note that in this task you are not required to minimize the number of operations. It suffices to find any way to transform a into b.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 109) — the number which Vasily has and the number he wants to have.

Output

If there is no way to get b from a, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print three lines. On the first line print "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain single integer k — the length of the transformation sequence. On the third line print the sequence of transformations x1, x2, ..., xk, where:

  * x1 should be equal to a, 
  * xk should be equal to b, 
  * xi should be obtained from xi - 1 using any of two described operations (1 < i ≤ k). 



If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Program:

import sys

def func():
    (n, big) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [str(big)]
    temp = big
    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big / 2
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            temp = (big - 1) // 10
            if temp * 10 + 1 == big:
                total.append(str(temp))
                big = temp
            else:
                break
    if total[-1] == str(n):
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `big` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n < big ≤ 10^9`. It then generates a sequence of numbers starting from `big` and repeatedly divides `big` by 2 if it is even, or subtracts 1 and divides by 10 if it is odd, until `big` becomes less than or equal to `n`. The function collects these numbers in a list `total` as their string representations. After the loop, if the last number in the sequence is equal to `n`, it prints "YES" followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in reverse order. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only performs I/O operations. The variables `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations do not appear in the function, and the function does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
