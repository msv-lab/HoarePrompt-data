Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when the sequence generated from `big` to `n` does not end exactly at `n`. Specifically, the program checks if the last element in the sequence is equal to `n` using `if total[-1] == str(n)`. However, this check can fail in certain scenarios where the sequence does not directly reach `n` due to the operations performed.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 15
```
The expected output should be:
```
NO
```
However, the program will generate the sequence `[15, 7, 3]` and then check if `3` is the last element in the sequence. Since it is, the program will incorrectly output:
```
YES
3
15 7 3
```
This is incorrect because the sequence does not start from `3` and end at `15` using the allowed operations.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the sequence starts from `n` and ends at `big` by constructing the sequence in reverse and verifying that the first element is `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
import sys

def func():
    (n, big) = map(int, input().split())
    total = [str(big)]
    temp = big
    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big // 2
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            temp = (big - 1) // 10
            if temp * 10 + 1 == big:
                total.append(str(temp))
                big = temp
            else:
                break
    if big == n:
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')

func()
```

In this corrected version, the final check is `if big == n` instead of `if total[-1] == str(n)`, ensuring that the sequence correctly starts from `n` and ends at `big`. This change makes the program correct for all potential cases.
