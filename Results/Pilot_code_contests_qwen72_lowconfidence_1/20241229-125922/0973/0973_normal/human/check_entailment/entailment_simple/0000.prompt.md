You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasily has a number a, which he wants to turn into a number b. For this purpose, he can do two types of operations:

  * multiply the current number by 2 (that is, replace the number x by 2·x); 
  * append the digit 1 to the right of current number (that is, replace the number x by 10·x + 1). 



You need to help Vasily to transform the number a into the number b using only the operations described above, or find that it is impossible.

Note that in this task you are not required to minimize the number of operations. It suffices to find any way to transform a into b.

Input

The first line contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 109) — the number which Vasily has and the number he wants to have.

Output

If there is no way to get b from a, print "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise print three lines. On the first line print "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain single integer k — the length of the transformation sequence. On the third line print the sequence of transformations x1, x2, ..., xk, where:

  * x1 should be equal to a, 
  * xk should be equal to b, 
  * xi should be obtained from xi - 1 using any of two described operations (1 < i ≤ k). 



If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n, big = map(int, raw_input().split())
    total = [str(big)]
    temp = big
    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big / 2
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            temp = (big - 1) // 10
            if temp * 10 + 1 == big:
                total.append(str(temp))
                big = temp
            else:
                break
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop.
    if (total[-1] == str(n)) :
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else :
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `big` are input integers. After the loop, `big` is less than or equal to `n`, `total` is a list containing the string representations of the original `big` and all subsequent values of `big` generated by the loop operations. `temp` remains equal to the original value of `big` throughout the loop. If the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`, then the last element of `total` is the string representation of `n`. Otherwise, the last element of `total` is not equal to the string representation of `n`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
