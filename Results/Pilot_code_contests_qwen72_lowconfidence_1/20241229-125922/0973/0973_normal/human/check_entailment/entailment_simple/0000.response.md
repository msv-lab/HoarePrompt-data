Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy means the program will not run as expected in Python 3 environments, which are more common today.

2. **Incorrect Backtracking Logic**: The program attempts to backtrack from `b` to `a` by either dividing by 2 or removing the last digit if it is 1. However, the logic for removing the last digit is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if temp * 10 + 1 == big:` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the program should simply check if the last digit of `big` is 1 and then remove it.

3. **Termination Condition**: The program terminates the loop when `big` becomes less than or equal to `n`. However, it should terminate when `big` equals `n` to ensure the correct sequence is found.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the sequence in reverse order, which is correct, but it should also handle the case where `big` cannot be reduced to `n` correctly. The current implementation breaks out of the loop prematurely in some cases, leading to incorrect output.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
import sys

def func():
    n, big = map(int, input().split())
    total = [str(big)]
    
    while big > n:
        if big % 2 == 0:
            big = big // 2
            total.append(str(big))
        elif big % 10 == 1:
            big = (big - 1) // 10
            total.append(str(big))
        else:
            break
    
    if big == n:
        sys.stdout.write('YES\n%d\n' % len(total) + ' '.join(total[::-1]) + '\n')
    else:
        sys.stdout.write('NO\n')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
1. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function is used instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
2. **Backtracking Logic**: The program correctly checks if `big` is divisible by 2 or ends with 1. If neither condition is met, the loop breaks, indicating that it's not possible to transform `a` to `b`.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until `big` equals `n`, ensuring the correct sequence is found.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints "YES" followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in reverse order if the transformation is possible. If not, it prints "NO".

This corrected program meets the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
