Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Loop Condition and Operations:**
   - The loop condition is `while big > n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `big` is greater than `n`. However, this does not guarantee that the sequence of operations will transform `a` into `b`.
   - The operations inside the loop are:
     - If `big` is even, divide it by 2.
     - If `big` is odd, subtract 1 and divide by 10.
   - These operations are not the inverse of the operations described in the problem statement. The problem states that the allowed operations are:
     - Multiply by 2.
     - Append 1 to the right.
   - The inverse operations should be:
     - Divide by 2 (if the number is even).
     - Subtract 1 and divide by 10 (if the number ends in 1).

2. **Incorrect Sequence Construction:**
   - The sequence is constructed by appending the results of the operations to the list `total`. However, the sequence should be constructed in reverse, starting from `b` and working backwards to `a`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the sequence cannot be constructed. It breaks out of the loop without ensuring that the final value is `a`.

3. **Incorrect Final Check:**
   - The final check `if (total[-1] == str(n))` is not sufficient to ensure that the sequence is correct. The sequence should be checked to ensure that each step is valid according to the allowed operations.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input `a = 2` and `b = 162`:
- The correct sequence should be `2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 81 -> 162`.
- The program will generate the sequence `162 -> 81 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2`, which is correct.
- However, for input `a = 4` and `b = 42`, the correct answer should be `NO` because it is impossible to transform 4 into 42 using the allowed operations.
- The program will incorrectly try to construct a sequence and may fail to detect that it is impossible to transform 4 into 42.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to transform `a` into `b` using the allowed operations and does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
