Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `b`. According to the problem statement, `a` should be less than `b`, but the program does not check this condition and may produce incorrect output if `n` is greater than `b`.

For example, if the input is:
```
5 2
```
The program will still attempt to run and produce an incorrect output because it does not validate that `a` is less than `b`. This violates the problem description, which states that `1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
