The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `big` from the standard input, where `1 ≤ n < big ≤ 10^9`. It then generates a sequence of numbers starting from `big` and repeatedly divides `big` by 2 if it is even, or subtracts 1 and divides by 10 if it is odd, until `big` becomes less than or equal to `n`. The function collects these numbers in a list `total` as their string representations. After the loop, if the last number in the sequence is equal to `n`, it prints "YES" followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself in reverse order. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value; it only performs I/O operations. The variables `a` and `b` mentioned in the annotations do not appear in the function, and the function does not compute the greatest common divisor (GCD).
