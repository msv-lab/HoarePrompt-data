Final: **True**

Reasoning:

The original assessment stated that the provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` did not address the specific problem of calculating the expected total number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code, it becomes clear that the program does indeed handle the required steps:

1. **Counting Inversions in Known Elements**:
   - The code uses a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently count the number of inversions in the known part of the permutation. This is done in the loop where `cnt` is incremented using `func_3` and `func_2`.

2. **Handling Unknown Elements (`-1`)**:
   - The program identifies and handles the `-1` elements by skipping them in the initial inversion counting loop.
   - It then calculates the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown elements. This is done by considering the number of missing elements and their potential positions relative to known elements.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The program combines the counts of inversions from known elements and the expected inversions from unknown elements.
   - It uses modular arithmetic to ensure the result is within the specified modulo.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly uses modular inverses and modular multiplication to compute the final result, ensuring it is in the form \( P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353} \).

Given the annotations and the detailed steps in the code, it is evident that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is not accurate, and the program should be considered correct. Thus, the final assessment is **True**.
