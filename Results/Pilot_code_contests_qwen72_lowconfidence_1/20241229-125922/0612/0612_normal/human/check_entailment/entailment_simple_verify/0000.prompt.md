You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation p is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and a_i < a_j. For example, a permutation [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

You are given a permutation p of size n. However, the numbers on some positions are replaced by -1. Let the valid permutation be such a replacement of -1 in this sequence back to numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the resulting sequence is a permutation of size n.

The given sequence was turned into a valid permutation randomly with the equal probability of getting each valid permutation.

Calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (-1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ 0) — the initial sequence.

It is guaranteed that all elements not equal to -1 are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Note

In the first example two resulting valid permutations are possible:

  * [3, 1, 2] — 2 inversions; 
  * [3, 2, 1] — 3 inversions. 



The expected value is (2 ⋅ 1 + 3 ⋅ 1)/(2) = 2.5.

In the second example no -1 are present, thus the only valid permutation is possible — the given one. It has 0 inversions.

In the third example there are two resulting valid permutations — one with 0 inversions and one with 1 inversion.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        func_2(fwtree, i, arr[i])
    return fwtree

#Function 2:
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        i += i & -i

#Function 3:
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to implement a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sum queries and updates. However, they do not address the specific problem of calculating the expected total number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`.

The problem requires a more complex approach that involves:

1. Counting the number of inversions in the known part of the permutation.
2. Calculating the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown elements (those replaced by `-1`).
3. Combining these to get the final expected number of inversions.

The provided code does not handle these steps. Specifically, it does not:
- Identify and handle the `-1` elements.
- Calculate the expected number of inversions for the unknown elements.
- Combine the results to produce the final output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:

for i in range(1, 200010):
    fac.append(i * fac[-1] % mod)
facInv = []
for i in fac:
    facInv.append(pow(i, mod - 2, mod))
n = input()
p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, raw_input().split()))
numMissing = len([x for x in p if x == -2])
A = [0 for i in range(n)]

    if i == -2:
        cntNeg += 1
        continue
    missingGreater = n - i - 1 - (func_3(A, n - 1) - func_3(A, i))
    missingSmaller = i - func_3(A, i - 1)
    missingLeftPos = cntNeg
    missingRightPos = numMissing - cntNeg
    cnt += fac[numMissing - 1] * missingGreater * missingLeftPos + fac[numMissing - 1] * missingSmaller * missingRightPos
cnt += fac[numMissing] * numMissing * (numMissing - 1) / 4
cnt %= mod
print(cnt * facInv[numMissing] % mod)

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
