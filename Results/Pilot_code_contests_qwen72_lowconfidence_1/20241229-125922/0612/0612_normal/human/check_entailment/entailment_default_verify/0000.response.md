Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not address the specific requirements of the problem description. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` implement a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sum queries and updates, but they do not handle the core aspects of the problem, which include:

1. Identifying and handling the `-1` elements in the permutation.
2. Calculating the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown elements.
3. Combining the known and expected inversions to produce the final result.

The output hints confirm that `func_3` correctly computes the sum of elements in the Fenwick Tree, but they do not indicate that the program as a whole addresses the problem of calculating the expected total number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`. Therefore, the program is incomplete and incorrect for the given problem.
