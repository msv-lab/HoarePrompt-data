Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to implement a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sum queries and updates. However, they do not address the specific problem of calculating the expected total number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`.

The problem requires a more complex approach that involves:

1. Counting the number of inversions in the known part of the permutation.
2. Calculating the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown elements (those replaced by `-1`).
3. Combining these to get the final expected number of inversions.

The provided code does not handle these steps. Specifically, it does not:
- Identify and handle the `-1` elements.
- Calculate the expected number of inversions for the unknown elements.
- Combine the results to produce the final output.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
