You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation p is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and a_i < a_j. For example, a permutation [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

You are given a permutation p of size n. However, the numbers on some positions are replaced by -1. Let the valid permutation be such a replacement of -1 in this sequence back to numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the resulting sequence is a permutation of size n.

The given sequence was turned into a valid permutation randomly with the equal probability of getting each valid permutation.

Calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (-1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ 0) — the initial sequence.

It is guaranteed that all elements not equal to -1 are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Note

In the first example two resulting valid permutations are possible:

  * [3, 1, 2] — 2 inversions; 
  * [3, 2, 1] — 3 inversions. 



The expected value is (2 ⋅ 1 + 3 ⋅ 1)/(2) = 2.5.

In the second example no -1 are present, thus the only valid permutation is possible — the given one. It has 0 inversions.

In the third example there are two resulting valid permutations — one with 0 inversions and one with 1 inversion.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n, and n is the length of arr.
def func_1(arr):
    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        func_2(fwtree, i, arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers with elements being either -1 or positive integers from 1 to n, and n is the length of `arr`; `fwtree` is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
    return fwtree
    #The program returns `fwtree`, which is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`. Each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n (n being the length of `arr`). It returns a list `fwtree` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` is initialized to 0. The function then updates each element of `fwtree` based on the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices using the function `func_2`. The final state of the program is that `fwtree` contains the updated values, and `arr` remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where `arr` contains elements outside the specified range (-1 or positive integers from 1 to n), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers, i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree), and val is an integer.
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `fwtree` is a list of integers where each element at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + (i & -i) + ((i + (i & -i)) & -(i + (i & -i)))`, etc., up to the last valid index, is incremented by `val`. `i` is now the smallest value such that `i >= len(fwtree)`, and `val` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` updates elements in a list `fwtree` starting from a given index `i` (where `0 <= i < len(fwtree)`) and increments each relevant element by a specified integer `val`. The indices that are updated follow a specific pattern determined by the bitwise operation `i += i & -i`, which continues until `i` exceeds the length of the list. After the function executes, `fwtree` contains the updated values, and the input parameters `i` and `val` remain unchanged. The final state of `fwtree` reflects the cumulative addition of `val` to the elements at indices calculated by the loop, and `i` is now the smallest value greater than or equal to the length of `fwtree`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, and i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree).
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`
    return s
    #The program returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`, which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `fwtree` and a non-negative integer `i` (where 0 <= i < len(fwtree)). It returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`. The function correctly handles the transformation of `i` to its corresponding index in the Fenwick Tree and accumulates the sum of the relevant elements. The final state of the program is that the variable `s` holds this computed sum, and `i` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function. Edge cases, such as when `i` is 0 or when `fwtree` is empty, are handled implicitly by the loop condition, ensuring that the function returns 0 in these scenarios.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
