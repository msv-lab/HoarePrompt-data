Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to implement a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sum queries, but they do not address the core problem of calculating the expected number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
3
3 -1 -1
```

### Expected Output:
```
499122179
```

### Actual Output:
The provided functions do not produce any output related to the expected number of inversions. They simply build a Fenwick Tree, which is not the solution to the problem.

### Explanation of the Expected Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Identify the positions of `-1` and the known values in the permutation.
2. Calculate the number of inversions contributed by the known values.
3. Calculate the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown values (replaced by `-1`).
4. Combine these to get the total expected number of inversions.
5. Compute the result modulo \(998244353\).

The provided code does not perform any of these steps, and thus it is incorrect.
