Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation, as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of the code and how they align with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The code reads the input correctly, converting the permutation elements to a 0-based index (by subtracting 1).
   - It calculates the number of missing elements (`numMissing`) and initializes the Fenwick Tree (`A`).

2. **Fenwick Tree Construction**:
   - `func_1` constructs the Fenwick Tree from the input array, which is used to efficiently query the number of elements up to a certain index.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are standard functions for updating and querying the Fenwick Tree, respectively. They are used to maintain and retrieve the cumulative counts of elements.

3. **Counting Inversions**:
   - The code iterates through the permutation, skipping `-1` elements, and uses the Fenwick Tree to count the inversions involving known elements.
   - It also handles the expected inversions involving the unknown elements (`-1`), considering the possible positions and values they can take.

4. **Expected Inversions Calculation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the expected number of inversions by considering the contributions from both known and unknown elements.
   - It uses modular arithmetic to ensure the result is within the specified modulo (`998244353`).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final result is printed in the required format, ensuring it is the value of \( P \cdot Q^{-1} \pmod{998244353} \).

Given the detailed breakdown and the alignment of the code with the problem requirements, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like permutations with no `-1` elements or permutations with all elements being `-1`. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
