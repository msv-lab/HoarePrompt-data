You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation p is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and a_i < a_j. For example, a permutation [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

You are given a permutation p of size n. However, the numbers on some positions are replaced by -1. Let the valid permutation be such a replacement of -1 in this sequence back to numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the resulting sequence is a permutation of size n.

The given sequence was turned into a valid permutation randomly with the equal probability of getting each valid permutation.

Calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (-1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ 0) — the initial sequence.

It is guaranteed that all elements not equal to -1 are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

-1 -1


Output

Note

In the first example two resulting valid permutations are possible:

  * [3, 1, 2] — 2 inversions; 
  * [3, 2, 1] — 3 inversions. 



The expected value is (2 ⋅ 1 + 3 ⋅ 1)/(2) = 2.5.

In the second example no -1 are present, thus the only valid permutation is possible — the given one. It has 0 inversions.

In the third example there are two resulting valid permutations — one with 0 inversions and one with 1 inversion.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        func_2(fwtree, i, arr[i])
    return fwtree

#Function 2:
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        i += i & -i

#Function 3:
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
