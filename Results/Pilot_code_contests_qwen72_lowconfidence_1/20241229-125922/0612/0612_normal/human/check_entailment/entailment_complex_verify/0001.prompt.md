You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A permutation of size n is an array of size n such that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly once in this array. An inversion in a permutation p is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i > j and a_i < a_j. For example, a permutation [4, 1, 3, 2] contains 4 inversions: (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).

You are given a permutation p of size n. However, the numbers on some positions are replaced by -1. Let the valid permutation be such a replacement of -1 in this sequence back to numbers from 1 to n in such a way that the resulting sequence is a permutation of size n.

The given sequence was turned into a valid permutation randomly with the equal probability of getting each valid permutation.

Calculate the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the sequence.

The second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (-1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ 0) — the initial sequence.

It is guaranteed that all elements not equal to -1 are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print a single integer — the expected total number of inversions in the resulting valid permutation.

It can be shown that it is in the form of P/Q where P and Q are non-negative integers and Q ≠ 0. Report the value of P ⋅ Q^{-1} \pmod {998244353}.

Note

In the first example two resulting valid permutations are possible:

  * [3, 1, 2] — 2 inversions; 
  * [3, 2, 1] — 3 inversions. 



The expected value is (2 ⋅ 1 + 3 ⋅ 1)/(2) = 2.5.

In the second example no -1 are present, thus the only valid permutation is possible — the given one. It has 0 inversions.

In the third example there are two resulting valid permutations — one with 0 inversions and one with 1 inversion.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        func_2(fwtree, i, arr[i])
    return fwtree

#Function 2:
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        i += i & -i

#Function 3:
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        i -= i & -i
    return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to implement a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) for prefix sum queries, but they do not address the core problem of calculating the expected number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
3
3 -1 -1
```

### Expected Output:
```
499122179
```

### Actual Output:
The provided functions do not produce any output related to the expected number of inversions. They simply build a Fenwick Tree, which is not the solution to the problem.

### Explanation of the Expected Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Identify the positions of `-1` and the known values in the permutation.
2. Calculate the number of inversions contributed by the known values.
3. Calculate the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown values (replaced by `-1`).
4. Combine these to get the total expected number of inversions.
5. Compute the result modulo \(998244353\).

The provided code does not perform any of these steps, and thus it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
mod = 998244353
fac = [1]
for i in range(1, 200010):
    fac.append(i * fac[-1] % mod)
facInv = []
for i in fac:
    facInv.append(pow(i, mod - 2, mod))
n = input()
p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - 1, raw_input().split()))
numMissing = len([x for x in p if x == -2])
A = [0 for i in range(n)]
A = func_1(A)
cnt = 0
for i in p:
    if i == -2:
        continue
    cnt += func_3(A, n - 1) - func_3(A, i)
    func_2(A, i, 1)
cnt *= fac[numMissing]
cntNeg = 0
for i in p:
    if i == -2:
        cntNeg += 1
        continue
    missingGreater = n - i - 1 - (func_3(A, n - 1) - func_3(A, i))
    missingSmaller = i - func_3(A, i - 1)
    missingLeftPos = cntNeg
    missingRightPos = numMissing - cntNeg
    cnt += fac[numMissing - 1] * missingGreater * missingLeftPos + fac[numMissing - 1] * missingSmaller * missingRightPos
cnt += fac[numMissing] * numMissing * (numMissing - 1) / 4
cnt %= mod
print(cnt * facInv[numMissing] % mod)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n, and n is the length of arr.
def func_1(arr):
    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        func_2(fwtree, i, arr[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers with elements being either -1 or positive integers from 1 to n, and n is the length of `arr`; `fwtree` is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
    return fwtree
    #The program returns `fwtree`, which is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`. Each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n (n being the length of `arr`). It returns a list `fwtree` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` is initialized to 0. The function then updates each element of `fwtree` based on the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices using the function `func_2`. The final state of the program is that `fwtree` contains the updated values, and `arr` remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where `arr` contains elements outside the specified range (-1 or positive integers from 1 to n), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers, i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree), and val is an integer.
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `fwtree` is a list of integers where each element at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + (i & -i) + ((i + (i & -i)) & -(i + (i & -i)))`, etc., up to the last valid index, is incremented by `val`. `i` is now the smallest value such that `i >= len(fwtree)`, and `val` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` updates elements in a list `fwtree` starting from a given index `i` (where `0 <= i < len(fwtree)`) and increments each relevant element by a specified integer `val`. The indices that are updated follow a specific pattern determined by the bitwise operation `i += i & -i`, which continues until `i` exceeds the length of the list. After the function executes, `fwtree` contains the updated values, and the input parameters `i` and `val` remain unchanged. The final state of `fwtree` reflects the cumulative addition of `val` to the elements at indices calculated by the loop, and `i` is now the smallest value greater than or equal to the length of `fwtree`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, and i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree).
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`
    return s
    #The program returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`, which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `fwtree` and a non-negative integer `i` (where 0 <= i < len(fwtree)). It returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`. The function correctly handles the transformation of `i` to its corresponding index in the Fenwick Tree and accumulates the sum of the relevant elements. The final state of the program is that the variable `s` holds this computed sum, and `i` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function. Edge cases, such as when `i` is 0 or when `fwtree` is empty, are handled implicitly by the loop condition, ensuring that the function returns 0 in these scenarios.
