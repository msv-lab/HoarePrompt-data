Final: **True**

Reasoning:

The original assessment stated that the provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) did not address the specific problem of calculating the expected total number of inversions in a permutation with some elements replaced by `-1`. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the main logic of the program does indeed handle the required steps to solve the problem:

1. **Counting Inversions in Known Part:**
   - The code uses a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to count inversions in the known part of the permutation.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the Fenwick Tree, and `func_2` and `func_3` are used to update and query the tree, respectively.
   - The loop that iterates over the permutation and updates the count of inversions (`cnt`) correctly handles the known elements.

2. **Handling Unknown Elements (`-1`):**
   - The code correctly identifies and counts the number of unknown elements (`numMissing`).
   - It calculates the expected number of inversions contributed by the unknown elements by considering the positions of known elements and the possible placements of unknown elements.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The code combines the inversions counted from the known part and the expected inversions from the unknown part.
   - It uses combinatorial calculations involving factorials and modular inverses to compute the expected number of inversions.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly handles modular arithmetic to ensure the result is within the required modulo `998244353`.

Given the detailed annotations and the logic described, the program appears to correctly implement the required steps to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is not accurate, and the program should be considered correct.
