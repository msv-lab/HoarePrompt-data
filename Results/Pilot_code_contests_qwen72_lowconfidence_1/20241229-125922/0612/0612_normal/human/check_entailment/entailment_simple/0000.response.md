Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem described, but there are several issues that prevent it from being fully correct according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause a syntax error in Python 3.
   - The input handling for the permutation is not robust. Specifically, the conversion of input values to `int` and then subtracting 1 (`int(x) - 1`) is done using `raw_input().split()`, which might lead to issues if the input is not formatted correctly.

2. **Fenwick Tree Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a Fenwick Tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) but does not handle the case where the input array `arr` contains `-1` values. This means that the Fenwick Tree is not correctly initialized for the given problem constraints.

3. **Inversion Counting**:
   - The logic for counting inversions and calculating the expected number of inversions is complex and relies on the correctness of the Fenwick Tree operations. However, the program does not correctly handle the cases where there are multiple `-1` values and how they affect the inversion count.

4. **Modular Inverse Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the modular inverse using `pow(i, mod - 2, mod)`, which is correct, but the overall logic for combining these inverses and the final result is not clearly correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the input permutation is already complete (no `-1` values) or when the input permutation is entirely `-1` values.

### Specific Issues:

1. **Python Version Compatibility**:
   - Using `raw_input()` instead of `input()` will cause the program to fail in Python 3.

2. **Fenwick Tree Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` should handle `-1` values in the input array. The current implementation does not account for these values, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Inversion Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the expected number of inversions is complex and not clearly explained. The program should ensure that it correctly handles the contributions of `-1` values to the inversion count.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The final result should be computed modulo \(998244353\). The program should ensure that all intermediate results are also handled correctly under modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
