The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n (n being the length of `arr`). It returns a list `fwtree` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` is initialized to 0. The function then updates each element of `fwtree` based on the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices using the function `func_2`. The final state of the program is that `fwtree` contains the updated values, and `arr` remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where `arr` contains elements outside the specified range (-1 or positive integers from 1 to n), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
