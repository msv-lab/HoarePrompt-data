The value of `s` is updated by adding the value of `fwtree[i]` to it. The initial value of `s` was 0, so now `s` is equal to `fwtree[i]`. The values of `fwtree` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, i is a positive integer such that 1 <= i < len(fwtree), s = fwtree[i]**
