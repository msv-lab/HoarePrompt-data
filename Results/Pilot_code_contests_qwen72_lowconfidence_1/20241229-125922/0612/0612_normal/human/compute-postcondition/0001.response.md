The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree), after incrementing, `i` will be a non-negative integer such that 1 <= i < len(fwtree) or 0 <= i <= len(fwtree) - 1. The value of `s` remains 0.

Output State: **fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, i is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= i < len(fwtree) or 0 <= i <= len(fwtree) - 1, s = 0**
