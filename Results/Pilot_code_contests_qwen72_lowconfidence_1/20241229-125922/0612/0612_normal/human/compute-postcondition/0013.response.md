The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `fwtree` and `i`. `fwtree` is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, and `i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree). The function returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `fwtree` and a non-negative integer `i` (where 0 <= i < len(fwtree)). It returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`.**
