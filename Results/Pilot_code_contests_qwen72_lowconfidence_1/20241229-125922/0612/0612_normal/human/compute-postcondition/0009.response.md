`s` is updated by adding the value of `fwtree[i]` to its current value. Initially, `s` is `2 * fwtree[i]`. After the execution, `s` becomes `2 * fwtree[i] + fwtree[i]`, which simplifies to `3 * fwtree[i]`. The value of `i` remains `i - (i & -i)` and must be greater than 0. The value of `fwtree` is not altered.

Output State: **`fwtree` is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, `i` is `i - (i & -i)` and must be greater than 0, `s` is `3 * fwtree[i]`**
