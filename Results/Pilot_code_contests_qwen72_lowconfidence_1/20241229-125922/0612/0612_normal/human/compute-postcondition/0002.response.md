According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be greater than 0. Right before the loop, `i` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= i < len(fwtree) or 0 <= i <= len(fwtree) - 1. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 0.

Since the condition `1 <= i < len(fwtree)` already ensures that `i` is greater than 0, we only need to adjust the state to ensure that `i` is at least 1.

State: **fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, i is a positive integer such that 1 <= i < len(fwtree), s = 0**
