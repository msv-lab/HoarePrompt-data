The value of `i` is updated using the operation `i -= i & -i`. This operation effectively subtracts the least significant bit (LSB) that is set to 1 in the binary representation of `i`. The value of `s` remains unchanged.

Let's assume the initial value of `i` is a positive integer within the range 1 <= i < len(fwtree). After executing the code, the value of `i` will be `i - (i & -i)`.

The output state is: `fwtree` is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, `i` is now `i - (i & -i)`, `s = fwtree[i]`.

Output State: **`fwtree` is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, `i` is now `i - (i & -i)`, `s = fwtree[i]`**
