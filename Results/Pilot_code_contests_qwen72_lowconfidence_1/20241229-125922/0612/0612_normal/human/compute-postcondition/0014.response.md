Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `fwtree` and a non-negative integer `i` (where 0 <= i < len(fwtree)). It returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`. The function correctly handles the transformation of `i` to its corresponding index in the Fenwick Tree and accumulates the sum of the relevant elements. The final state of the program is that the variable `s` holds this computed sum, and `i` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function. Edge cases, such as when `i` is 0 or when `fwtree` is empty, are handled implicitly by the loop condition, ensuring that the function returns 0 in these scenarios. **
