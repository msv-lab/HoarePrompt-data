The value of `s` is updated by adding the value of `fwtree[i]` to its current value. The value of `i` is already defined as `i - (i & -i)` from the initial state. The initial state also specifies that `s = fwtree[i]` before this operation, and `i` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, after executing `s += fwtree[i]`, the new value of `s` becomes `2 * fwtree[i]` because `s` was initially set to `fwtree[i]`, and then `fwtree[i]` is added to it again.

The value of `i` and the list `fwtree` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`fwtree` is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, `i` is `i - (i & -i)`, `s` is `2 * fwtree[i]`, and `i` must be greater than 0**
