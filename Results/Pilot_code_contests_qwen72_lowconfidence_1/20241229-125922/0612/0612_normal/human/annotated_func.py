    fwtree = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
    for i in range(len(arr)):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers with elements being either -1 or positive integers from 1 to n, and n is the length of `arr`; `fwtree` is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices; `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
    return fwtree
    #The program returns `fwtree`, which is a list of integers with a length of `len(arr) + 1`. Each element of `fwtree` has been updated by the function `func_2` according to the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of integers, where each element is either -1 or a positive integer from 1 to n (n being the length of `arr`). It returns a list `fwtree` of length `len(arr) + 1`, where each element of `fwtree` is initialized to 0. The function then updates each element of `fwtree` based on the corresponding elements of `arr` and their indices using the function `func_2`. The final state of the program is that `fwtree` contains the updated values, and `arr` remains unchanged. The function does not handle the case where `arr` contains elements outside the specified range (-1 or positive integers from 1 to n), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers, i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree), and val is an integer.
def func_2(fwtree, i, val):
    i += 1
    while i < len(fwtree):
        fwtree[i] += val
        
        i += i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `fwtree` is a list of integers where each element at indices `i`, `i + (i & -i)`, `i + (i & -i) + ((i + (i & -i)) & -(i + (i & -i)))`, etc., up to the last valid index, is incremented by `val`. `i` is now the smallest value such that `i >= len(fwtree)`, and `val` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` updates elements in a list `fwtree` starting from a given index `i` (where `0 <= i < len(fwtree)`) and increments each relevant element by a specified integer `val`. The indices that are updated follow a specific pattern determined by the bitwise operation `i += i & -i`, which continues until `i` exceeds the length of the list. After the function executes, `fwtree` contains the updated values, and the input parameters `i` and `val` remain unchanged. The final state of `fwtree` reflects the cumulative addition of `val` to the elements at indices calculated by the loop, and `i` is now the smallest value greater than or equal to the length of `fwtree`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: fwtree is a list of integers representing a Fenwick Tree, and i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < len(fwtree).
def func_3(fwtree, i):
    s = 0
    i += 1
    while i > 0:
        s += fwtree[i]
        
        i -= i & -i
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`
    return s
    #The program returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`, which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `fwtree` and a non-negative integer `i` (where 0 <= i < len(fwtree)). It returns the sum of elements in `fwtree` indexed by all the positions that contribute to the Fenwick Tree representation of the original value of `i`. The function correctly handles the transformation of `i` to its corresponding index in the Fenwick Tree and accumulates the sum of the relevant elements. The final state of the program is that the variable `s` holds this computed sum, and `i` is reduced to 0 by the end of the function. Edge cases, such as when `i` is 0 or when `fwtree` is empty, are handled implicitly by the loop condition, ensuring that the function returns 0 in these scenarios.
