The function `func_2` updates elements in a list `fwtree` starting from a given index `i` (where `0 <= i < len(fwtree)`) and increments each relevant element by a specified integer `val`. The indices that are updated follow a specific pattern determined by the bitwise operation `i += i & -i`, which continues until `i` exceeds the length of the list. After the function executes, `fwtree` contains the updated values, and the input parameters `i` and `val` remain unchanged. The final state of `fwtree` reflects the cumulative addition of `val` to the elements at indices calculated by the loop, and `i` is now the smallest value greater than or equal to the length of `fwtree`.
