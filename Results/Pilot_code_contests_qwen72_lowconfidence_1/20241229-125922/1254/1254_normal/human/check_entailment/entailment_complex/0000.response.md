Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Board Initialization**:
   - In `func_2()`, the code appends 8 new rows to the `board` list, but it does not clear the initial `board` list. This means that if `board` already contains some data (e.g., from a previous run), it will grow to 16 rows instead of maintaining 8 rows. This violates the problem description, which specifies that the board is always an 8x8 grid.

2. **Handling Fully Black Columns**:
   - The function `func_1(col_num)` is supposed to check if a column is fully black and if it can be painted by a single stroke. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if all cells in the column are black and if all rows have been painted. This is incorrect because a column can be fully black even if not all rows have been painted. The function should simply check if the column is fully black and then increment the stroke count if it is.

3. **Counting Strokes**:
   - The function `func_2()` counts the number of fully black rows and columns, but it does not handle the case where a row and a column overlap. For example, if a row and a column are both fully black, they should be counted as a single stroke if they intersect at a black square. The current implementation does not account for this overlap, leading to an incorrect count of strokes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases where the entire board is black or entirely white. For a completely black board, the correct output should be 8 (since all rows or columns are black), but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.

To summarize, the code does not correctly handle the problem of counting the minimum number of strokes needed to paint the board according to the client's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
