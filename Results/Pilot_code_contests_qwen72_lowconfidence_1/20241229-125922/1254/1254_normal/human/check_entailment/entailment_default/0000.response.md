Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_2` reads input using `raw_input()` and `xrange()`, which are Python 2 constructs. In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`, and `xrange()` has been replaced by `range()`. This means the code will not run correctly in Python 3 environments, which is a common environment for modern Python development.

Additionally, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where a column is entirely black but is not a result of painting an entire row. The function returns `True` if all cells in the column are `True` and not all rows have been painted black, which can lead to over-counting the number of strokes needed. For example, if a column is entirely black because it is part of a row that was painted black, the function will still count it as a separate stroke, leading to an incorrect result.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBB
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
8
```

In this case, the entire board is black, which can be achieved by painting just one row or one column. However, the program incorrectly counts all 8 columns as separate strokes, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for all potential cases.
