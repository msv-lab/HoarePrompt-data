Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that make it incorrect for some inputs:

1. **Use of `xrange`**: The function `xrange` is not available in Python 3; it should be replaced with `range`.

2. **Reading Input**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is also not available in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()`.

3. **Initialization of `painted_rows` and `painted_cols`**: The variables `painted_rows` and `painted_cols` are used but never initialized. This will cause a `NameError` when the program tries to access these variables.

4. **Handling of Rows and Columns**: The logic in `func_1` is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the condition `return True and (not painted_by_rows)` might not accurately reflect whether a column needs to be painted.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where a row or column is partially painted (e.g., a row with a mix of 'B' and 'W' squares). It assumes that if a row or column is fully black, it can be painted in one stroke, but it does not check if a row or column can be part of a valid solution if it is not fully black.

To fix these issues, the program should be updated to use Python 3 syntax, properly initialize variables, and simplify the logic for checking rows and columns. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_strokes(board):
    # Initialize painted rows and columns
    painted_rows = [False] * 8
    painted_cols = [False] * 8

    # Count the number of fully black rows and columns
    strokes = 0

    # Check rows
    for row_num, row in enumerate(board):
        if all(cell == 'B' for cell in row):
            strokes += 1
            painted_rows[row_num] = True

    # Check columns
    for col_num in range(8):
        if all(board[row_num][col_num] == 'B' for row_num in range(8)):
            if not all(painted_rows[row_num] for row_num in range(8)):
                strokes += 1
                painted_cols[col_num] = True

    return strokes

# Read input
board = [input().strip() for _ in range(8)]

# Calculate and print the result
print(min_strokes(board))
```

This corrected version initializes `painted_rows` and `painted_cols`, uses `range` instead of `xrange`, and `input` instead of `raw_input`. It also simplifies the logic for checking rows and columns, ensuring that it handles all edge cases correctly.
