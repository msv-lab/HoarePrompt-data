Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the scenario where a column is completely painted black but the rows intersecting those columns are not fully painted black. According to the problem description, if a column is completely black, it should be counted as a single stroke, regardless of whether the rows are fully painted or not. However, the current implementation only counts a column as a stroke if all the rows are already painted black, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
WBWBWBWB
```

Expected Output:
```
8
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

In this case, each column is completely black, but no rows are fully painted black. The program should count each column as a stroke, resulting in 8 strokes. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 because it does not properly handle the case where a column is completely black but the rows are not.
