Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Data Structures for `painted_rows` and `painted_cols`:**
   - The problem description states that `painted_rows` and `painted_cols` should be lists of booleans. However, in the program, they are initialized as lists but are later used as dictionaries. This is a mismatch and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. **Incorrect Board Initialization:**
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read the input, which is deprecated in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
   - The board is appended to twice, leading to a board with 16 rows instead of 8. This is clearly incorrect and violates the problem description.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Strokes:**
   - The program counts the number of rows and columns that need to be painted, but it does not correctly handle the case where a row or column is already painted. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that a square can be painted multiple times but only changes color once.
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check if a column can be painted, but it does not correctly handle the case where a column is already painted by a row. This can lead to over-counting the number of strokes needed.

4. **Inefficient and Incorrect Use of `painted_by_rows`:**
   - The variable `painted_by_rows` is used to check if all squares in a column are painted by rows. However, it is not used effectively, and the logic for determining if a column can be painted is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To meet the problem description, the program should:

1. **Initialize the board correctly:**
   - Use `input()` to read the input.
   - Initialize the board as an 8x8 grid of booleans.

2. **Count the number of rows and columns that need to be painted:**
   - Iterate through each row and count how many rows are entirely black.
   - Iterate through each column and count how many columns are entirely black.
   - Ensure that a square is not counted multiple times if it is painted by both a row and a column.

3. **Use the correct data structures:**
   - Use lists for `painted_rows` and `painted_cols`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_strokes_to_paint_chessboard():
    board = []
    for _ in range(8):
        row = input().strip()
        board.append([c == 'B' for c in row])

    painted_rows = [all(row) for row in board]
    painted_cols = [all(board[row_num][col_num] for row_num in range(8)) for col_num in range(8)]

    strokes = sum(painted_rows) + sum(painted_cols)

    # Ensure no double counting
    for row_num in range(8):
        for col_num in range(8):
            if painted_rows[row_num] and painted_cols[col_num]:
                strokes -= 1

    print(strokes)

min_strokes_to_paint_chessboard()
```

This corrected version initializes the board correctly, counts the number of rows and columns that need to be painted, and ensures that no square is double-counted. It meets the requirements of the problem description.
