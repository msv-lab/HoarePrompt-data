The provided code snippet is a simple print statement that outputs the value of the variable `strokes`. This does not alter the state of any variables or data structures within the program. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the value of `strokes` is printed.

Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols[col_num]` is `True` for each `col_num` where `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`, `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus the number of columns for which `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`, `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and the loop has iterated over all column numbers from 0 to 7.**
