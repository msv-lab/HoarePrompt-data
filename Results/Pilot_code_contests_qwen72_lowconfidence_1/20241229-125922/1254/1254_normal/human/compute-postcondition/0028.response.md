The value of `strokes` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans. If `func_1(col_num)` returns `True` for `col_num = 0`, then `painted_cols[0]` is `True`, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 2. Otherwise, `painted_cols` remains unchanged, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1. `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and `col_num` is 1.**
