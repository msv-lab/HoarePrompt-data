The code assigns `True` to `painted_cols[col_num]`. Given that `col_num` is 2, `painted_cols[2]` is now `True`.

- `board` remains a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows` remains a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `painted_cols` is updated such that `painted_cols[1]` is `True` if `func_1(1)` returns `True`, and `painted_cols[2]` is now `True`.
- `strokes` remains the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1 if `func_1(1)` returns `True` plus 1, otherwise it is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1.
- `painted_rows[row_num]` remains `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`.
- `y` remains 7.
- `col_num` remains 2.

Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols[1]` is `True` if `func_1(1)` returns `True`, `painted_cols[2]` is `True`, `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1 if `func_1(1)` returns `True` plus 1, otherwise it is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1, `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, `col_num` is 2**
