Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads 8 lines of input, each line consisting of 8 characters, and appends these lines to the existing `board` list, converting each character to a boolean (`True` if the character is 'B', otherwise `False`). It then counts the number of fully painted rows and columns, updating the `painted_rows` and `painted_cols` dictionaries accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of such rows and columns. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where the input lines do not contain exactly 8 characters, which would cause the function to behave incorrectly. Additionally, the function assumes that `board`, `painted_rows`, and `painted_cols` are pre-defined and correctly initialized before the function is called. **
