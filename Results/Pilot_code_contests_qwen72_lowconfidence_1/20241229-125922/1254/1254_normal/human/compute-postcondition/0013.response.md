To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `y` is 7.
- `row_num` is 0.
- `row` is the first row in `board`.
- If all elements in `row` are `True`, `painted_rows[0]` is `True` and `strokes` is 1. Otherwise, `painted_rows[0]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (row_num, row) in enumerate(board):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the `board` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`row_num`) and the corresponding row (`row`).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `row_num` is 0.
   - `row` is the first row in `board`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `row_num`**: Since `enumerate` increments `row_num` automatically, the next value of `row_num` will be 1.
- **Update `row`**: The next value of `row` will be the second row in `board`.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `row_num` should be 1.
- `row` should be the second row in `board`.

### Final State:
State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `y` is 7, `row_num` is 1, `row` is the second row in `board`. If all elements in `row` are `True`, `painted_rows[1]` is `True` and `strokes` is 1. Otherwise, `painted_rows[1]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 0.**
