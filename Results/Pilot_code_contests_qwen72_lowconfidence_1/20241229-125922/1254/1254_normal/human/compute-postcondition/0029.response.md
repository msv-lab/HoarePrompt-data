`painted_cols[col_num]` is set to `True` for `col_num = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans where `painted_cols[1]` is `True`, `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1, `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and `col_num` is 1.
