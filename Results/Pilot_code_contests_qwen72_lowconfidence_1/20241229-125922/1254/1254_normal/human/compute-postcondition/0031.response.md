To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- If `func_1(col_num)` returns `True` for `col_num = 1`, then `painted_cols[1]` is `True`.
- `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1 if `func_1(col_num)` returns `True` for `col_num = 1`. Otherwise, `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True`.
- `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`.
- `y` is 7.
- `col_num` is 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for col_num in xrange(8):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `col_num` from 0 to 7 (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `col_num` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `col_num` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments:
- `col_num` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
- No other variables need to be adjusted because the loop condition (`col_num` in `xrange(8)`) only depends on `col_num`.

### Final State:
State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols[1]` is `True` if `func_1(1)` returns `True`, `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1 if `func_1(1)` returns `True`, otherwise it is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True`, `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, `col_num` is 2**
