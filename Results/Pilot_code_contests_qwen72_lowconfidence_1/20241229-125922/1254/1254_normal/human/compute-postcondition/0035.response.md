Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans. After the loop executes, `painted_cols[col_num]` is `True` for each `col_num` where `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`. `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus the number of columns for which `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`. `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and the loop has iterated over all column numbers from 0 to 7.**
