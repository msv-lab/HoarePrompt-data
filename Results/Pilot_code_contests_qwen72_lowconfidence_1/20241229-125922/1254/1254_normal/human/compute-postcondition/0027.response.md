To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- If `func_1(col_num)` returns `True` for `col_num = 0`, then `painted_cols[0]` is `True`, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1.
- Otherwise, `painted_cols` remains unchanged, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True`.
- `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`.
- `y` is 7.
- `col_num` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for col_num in xrange(8):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `col_num` from 0 to 7 (inclusive). This means the loop will run 8 times, once for each value of `col_num` from 0 to 7.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `col_num` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `col_num` must be incremented to 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `col_num` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
- The other variables (`board`, `painted_rows`, `painted_cols`, `strokes`, and `y`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans. If `func_1(col_num)` returns `True` for `col_num = 0`, then `painted_cols[0]` is `True`, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus 1. Otherwise, `painted_cols` remains unchanged, and `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True`. `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and `col_num` is 1.**
