The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided signature. However, the context suggests that the function operates on a global or pre-defined `board`, `painted_rows`, and `painted_cols` which are not passed as arguments but are used within the function. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so I cannot provide a definitive return value without additional information.

Given the typical structure and the information provided, we can infer the following:

- `board`: A list of 8 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows`: A dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans indicating whether the corresponding row has been painted.
- `painted_cols`: A dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans indicating whether the corresponding column has been painted.

Since the output is not specified, I will assume the function returns some form of status or result based on the state of the board, painted rows, and painted columns.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` operates on a predefined `board`, `painted_rows`, and `painted_cols`. It returns a result based on the state of these variables, but the specific return value is not provided.**

If you can provide more details about the expected output, I can refine this description further.
