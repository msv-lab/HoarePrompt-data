To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values.
- `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans.
- `y` is 7.
- `row_num` is 1.
- `row` is the second row in `board`.
- If all elements in `row` are `True`, `painted_rows[1]` is set to `True` and `strokes` is 1. Otherwise, `painted_rows[1]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (row_num, row) in enumerate(board):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the `board` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`row_num`) and the corresponding row (`row`).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `row_num` is 1 and `row` is the second row in `board`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`row_num`**: In the next iteration, `row_num` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- **`row`**: The next row in `board` should be the third row.

### Final State:
- `board` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop.
- `painted_rows` and `painted_cols` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
- `y` remains 7 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `row_num` is now 2.
- `row` is now the third row in `board`.
- `strokes` remains 0 unless modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `y` is 7, `row_num` is 2, `row` is the third row in `board`, `strokes` is 0**
