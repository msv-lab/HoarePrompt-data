The value of `strokes` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that if all elements in `row` (which is the second row in `board`) are `True`, `painted_rows[1]` is `True` and `strokes` is 1. Otherwise, `painted_rows[1]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 0. Since the code snippet only increments `strokes` by 1, the new value of `strokes` will be 1 + 1 if all elements in `row` are `True`, otherwise it will be 0 + 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `y` is 7, `row_num` is 1, `row` is the second row in `board`. If all elements in `row` are `True`, `painted_rows[1]` is `True` and `strokes` is 2. Otherwise, `painted_rows[1]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 1.

Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `y` is 7, `row_num` is 1, `row` is the second row in `board`. If all elements in `row` are `True`, `painted_rows[1]` is `True` and `strokes` is 2. Otherwise, `painted_rows[1]` remains unchanged and `strokes` is 1.**
