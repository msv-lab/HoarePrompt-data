The code assigns `True` to `painted_rows[row_num]`, where `row_num` is 1. This changes the value of `painted_rows[1]` to `True`. Since the code does not affect the other variables, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`board` is a list of 16 lists, each containing 8 boolean values, `painted_rows` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `painted_cols` is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans, `y` is 7, `row_num` is 1, `row` is the second row in `board`, `painted_rows[1]` is `True`, `strokes` is 1.**
