#State of the program right berfore the function call: col_num is an integer representing a column index in the board, where 0 <= col_num < 8. board is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions 8x8, where True represents a black square and False represents a white square. painted_rows is a list of booleans with length 8, where True indicates that the corresponding row has been painted black.
def func_1(col_num):
    painted_by_rows = True
    for (row_num, x) in enumerate(board):
        if x[col_num] != True:
            return False
        
        painted_by_rows = painted_by_rows and painted_rows[row_num]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `col_num` is an integer with \(0 \leq \text{col_num} < 8\), `board` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions 8x8, `painted_rows` is a list of booleans with length 8, `painted_by_rows` is the logical AND of all elements in `painted_rows`, `row_num` is 7, `x` is the last row of `board`, and `x[col_num]` is `board[7][col_num]`. If any `x[col_num]` is not True, the program returns False. If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `board` is empty, but it is given that `board` is 8x8), `painted_by_rows` remains True.
    return True and not painted_by_rows
    #The program returns the result of `True and not painted_by_rows`, where `painted_by_rows` is the logical AND of all elements in `painted_rows`, a list of booleans with length 8.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `col_num`, which is an integer representing a column index in a 2D list `board` of booleans with dimensions 8x8. The function checks if all cells in the specified column `col_num` are `True` (indicating black squares). If any cell in the column is `False`, the function immediately returns `False`. If all cells in the column are `True`, the function then evaluates whether all rows have been painted black by checking the `painted_rows` list. If any row has not been painted black (`painted_rows` contains a `False`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if all rows have been painted black (`painted_rows` contains only `True` values), the function returns `False`. The function does not modify the `board` or `painted_rows` lists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: board is a list of 8 lists, each containing 8 boolean values; painted_rows is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans indicating whether the corresponding row has been painted; painted_cols is a dictionary with keys being integers from 0 to 7 and values being booleans indicating whether the corresponding column has been painted.

After the loop executes, `painted_cols[col_num]` is `True` for each `col_num` where `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`. `strokes` is the number of rows in `board` where all elements are `True` plus the number of columns for which `func_1(col_num)` returned `True`. `painted_rows[row_num]` is `True` for each `row_num` where all elements in `board[row_num]` are `True`, `y` is 7, and the loop has iterated over all column numbers from 0 to 7.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads 8 lines of input, each line consisting of 8 characters, and appends these lines to the existing `board` list, converting each character to a boolean (`True` if the character is 'B', otherwise `False`). It then counts the number of fully painted rows and columns, updating the `painted_rows` and `painted_cols` dictionaries accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of such rows and columns. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where the input lines do not contain exactly 8 characters, which would cause the function to behave incorrectly. Additionally, the function assumes that `board`, `painted_rows`, and `painted_cols` are pre-defined and correctly initialized before the function is called.
