The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `col_num`, which is an integer representing a column index in a 2D list `board` of booleans with dimensions 8x8. The function checks if all cells in the specified column `col_num` are `True` (indicating black squares). If any cell in the column is `False`, the function immediately returns `False`. If all cells in the column are `True`, the function then evaluates whether all rows have been painted black by checking the `painted_rows` list. If any row has not been painted black (`painted_rows` contains a `False`), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, if all rows have been painted black (`painted_rows` contains only `True` values), the function returns `False`. The function does not modify the `board` or `painted_rows` lists.
