The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet causes the current iteration of a loop to end early, skipping any remaining code in the loop body for the current iteration and moving directly to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, it affects the flow of control, which means that any code following this statement in the same loop iteration would not be executed. Since there is no further code provided, we can assume that the state remains unchanged except for the fact that the current iteration of the loop (if this code is inside a loop) is terminated early.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, the current iteration of the loop is terminated early.**
