The provided code snippet only prints the value of `max_overlap`. It does not alter any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `max_overlap` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is the maximum number of points in `data` that lie within a distance `RADIUS` from any point in `cross_points`. If `cross_points` is empty (which implies `num_data` is 0 or the circles do not intersect within the bounds), `max_overlap` remains 0.**
