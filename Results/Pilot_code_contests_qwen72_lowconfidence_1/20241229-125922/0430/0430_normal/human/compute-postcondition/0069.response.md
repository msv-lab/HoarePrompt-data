To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` is 0.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `data` list, from 0 to `num_data - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and the loop has processed the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The next iteration will process the tuple at index 1 in `data`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be incremented to 1.
- `x1` must be updated to the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `y1` must be updated to the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- The `cross_points` list must be recalculated based on the new values of `x1` and `y1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.**
