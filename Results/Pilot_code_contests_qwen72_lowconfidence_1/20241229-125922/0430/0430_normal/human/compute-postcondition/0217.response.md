To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is at least 2.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- `max_overlap` is equal to `count` if `max_overlap` was less than `count` before the if statement, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged.
- `count` is the number of points in `data` whose distance to `(cx, cy)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`.

### Loop Structure:
```
for (cx, cy) in cross_points:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in the `cross_points` list.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `xi` and `yi` are coordinates of the centers of stickers.
   - `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2` are fixed values.
   - `num_data` is at least 2.
   - `data` is a list of tuples.
   - `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points.
   - `max_overlap` and `count` are updated based on conditions within the loop body.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `(cx, cy)` is updated to the next tuple in `cross_points`.
   - The state of `cross_points` must ensure there is at least one more tuple to iterate over.
   - Other variables (`n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `max_overlap`, `count`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable `(cx, cy)`, which should be set to the next tuple in `cross_points`.
