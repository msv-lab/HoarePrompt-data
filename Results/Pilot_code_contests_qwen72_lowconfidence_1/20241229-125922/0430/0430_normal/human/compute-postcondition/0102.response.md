The code snippet provided calculates the coordinates of a second intersection point (`cp2`) between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and another circle centered at \((x2, y2)\) with the same radius. The calculation involves using trigonometric functions to determine the angle and position of the intersection point.

Here's the step-by-step impact of the code:

1. **`cp2` Calculation**:
   - `cp2` is assigned the value of \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).
   - `th` is already defined as \(\text{math.atan2}(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)\).
   - `al` is already defined as \(\text{math.acos}(distance / 2.0)\).

2. **Variables Affected**:
   - `cp2` is updated with the new coordinates.

3. **Variables Not Affected**:
   - `n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`, and `cp1` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); No two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.**
