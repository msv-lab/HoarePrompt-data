The code appends `cp1` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp1` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, then `cp1` is `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `cp1` is calculated using the formula `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.

Let's summarize the impact of the code:

- `cross_points` is updated by appending `cp1` to it.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); no two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `cross_points` now includes `cp1`, which is either `(x1, y1)` if `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, or `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))` otherwise.**
