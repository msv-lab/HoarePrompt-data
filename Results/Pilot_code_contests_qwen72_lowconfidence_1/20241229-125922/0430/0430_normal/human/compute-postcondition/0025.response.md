The code snippet calculates the value of `al` using the `math.acos` function. The argument to `math.acos` is the result of the expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`. Given that `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2` (which is \(2.000000000001\)), the expression simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.

Since `distance` is a positive value (as distances are non-negative and `distance` is specified to be less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`), the argument to `math.acos` is a valid input (it lies within the domain of the `acos` function, which is between -1 and 1).

The value of `al` is thus calculated as the arc cosine of `distance / 2.0`.
