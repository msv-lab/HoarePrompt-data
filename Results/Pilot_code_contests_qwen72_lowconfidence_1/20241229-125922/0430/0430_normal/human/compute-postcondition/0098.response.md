The given code snippet sets both `cp1` and `cp2` to the tuple `(x1, y1)`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Variables Affected**: 
   - `cp1` is set to `(x1, y1)`.
   - `cp2` is set to `(x1, y1)`.

2. **Variables Unchanged**:
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `xi` and `yi` remain real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
   - No two stickers have the same coordinates.
   - `RADIUS` remains \(1.000000000001\).
   - `RADIUS_2` remains \(2.000000000001\).
   - `num_data` remains a non-negative integer greater than 0.
   - `data` remains a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `x1` remains the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
   - `y1` remains the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
   - `cross_points` remains a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
   - `num_data` must be greater than 1.
   - `x2` remains the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`.
   - `y2` remains the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`.
   - `distance` remains the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\), calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); no two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\), calculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1); `cp1` is `(x1, y1); `cp2` is `(x1, y1)**
