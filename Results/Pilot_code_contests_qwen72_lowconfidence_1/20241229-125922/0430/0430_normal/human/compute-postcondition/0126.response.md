To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` is 1.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num_data`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
4. **Data Access**: The loop will then access the tuple at index 2 in `data` for the next iteration.
5. **Coordinates Update**: The coordinates `x1` and `y1` will be updated to the first and second elements of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
6. **Cross Points Calculation**: The `cross_points` list will be recalculated based on the new center `(x1, y1)` and the other points in `data`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 2.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `cross_points` will be recalculated based on the new center `(x1, y1)` and the other points in `data`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.**
