To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop structure.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` is 0.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `j` is 1.
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, and if `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`.
- Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`.
- If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` contains the value of `cp1`.
- If `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` also contains the value of `cp2`.
- If `distance > RADIUS_2`, no changes are made to `cp1`, `cp2`, or `cross_points`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `num_data`, which is the number of tuples in the `data` list.
- The loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `num_data`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The values of `x2` and `y2` need to be updated to the next tuple in the `data` list.
- The value of `distance` needs to be recalculated based on the new `x2` and `y2`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same.
- `xi` and `yi` remain the same.
- `RADIUS` remains the same.
- `RADIUS_2` remains the same.
- `num_data` remains the same.
- `data` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `x1` remains the same.
- `y1` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is 2.
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `distance` is recalculated as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. If `distance <= RADIUS_2`, and if `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` contains the value of `cp1`. If `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` also contains the value of `cp2`. If `distance > RADIUS_2`, no changes are made to `cp1`, `cp2`, or `cross_points`.**
