The code snippet `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the `math.acos` function, which computes the arc cosine of the argument. The argument is calculated as `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`, which simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.

Given that `distance` is already defined as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, the calculation of `al` is based on this distance.

Let's calculate the new value of `al`:

- `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- The argument for `math.acos` is `distance / 2.0`.

Thus, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

The output state should reflect the new value of `al` while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.
