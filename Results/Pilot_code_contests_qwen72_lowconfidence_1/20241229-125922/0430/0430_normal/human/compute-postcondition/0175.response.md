The code snippet provided is:
```python
cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)
```

Given the initial state:
- The values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and other variables remain unchanged.
- A `NameError` occurs due to the undefined variable `al`.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Variable `al` is undefined**: This causes a `NameError` because `al` is referenced in the expression but has not been defined. As a result, the line of code cannot be executed successfully.

2. **Impact on other variables**: Since the code execution fails due to the `NameError`, no changes occur to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `th`, or any other variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the error condition.

Output State: **The values of `x1`, `y1`, `th`, and other variables remain unchanged. A `NameError` occurs due to the undefined variable `al`.**
