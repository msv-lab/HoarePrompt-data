The code assigns new values to the variables `RADIUS` and `RADIUS_2`. These values are specific and can be calculated directly:

- `RADIUS` is assigned the value `1 + 1e-12`, which is approximately `1.000000000001`.
- `RADIUS_2` is assigned the value `2 + 1e-12`, which is approximately `2.000000000001`.

The initial state information about `n`, `xi`, and `yi` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100. For each dataset, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10. No two stickers have the same coordinates. `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`.**
