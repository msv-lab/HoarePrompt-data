Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper. If `max_overlap` is less than `count`, then `max_overlap` is updated to be equal to `count`. Otherwise, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.***
