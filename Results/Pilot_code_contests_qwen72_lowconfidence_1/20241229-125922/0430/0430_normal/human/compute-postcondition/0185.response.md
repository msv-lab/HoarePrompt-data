To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the conditions that ensure the loop iterates at least once. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for (cx, cy) in cross_points:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, the list `cross_points` must contain at least one element. Let's break down the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- If `num_data` is 0, `cross_points` remains an empty list.
- `max_overlap` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The loop will only execute if `cross_points` is not empty.
- For `cross_points` to be non-empty, there must be at least one valid intersection point between the circles.
- A valid intersection point exists if there are at least two points in `data` whose circles intersect within the bounds of the square origami paper.

### Necessary Adjustments:
1. **Ensure `num_data` is at least 2**: This ensures that there are at least two points in `data` to form a valid intersection.
2. **Ensure the points in `data` are within the bounds of the square origami paper**: This is already guaranteed by the given state.
3. **Ensure the circles centered at these points intersect**: This is a geometric condition that depends on the specific coordinates and the radii.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, `num_data` must be at least 2, and `cross_points` must contain at least one valid intersection point. Since the exact coordinates and their intersections are not provided, we assume that the points in `data` are such that they form at least one valid intersection.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is 0.**
