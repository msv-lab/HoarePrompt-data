Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); no two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cp1` is appended to `cross_points`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains unchanged. `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); if `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to \((x1, y1)\); otherwise, `th` is the angle (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cp1` is \((x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))\), while `cp2` is \((x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))\).***
