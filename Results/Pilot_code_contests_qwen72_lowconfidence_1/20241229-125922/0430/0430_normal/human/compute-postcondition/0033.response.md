The code appends `cp2` to the `cross_points` list. We need to consider the conditions under which `cp2` is defined and whether it meets the criteria to be appended.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\)
- No two stickers have the same coordinates
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\)
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple
- `i` is 0
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `j` is 0
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- If `i` is equal to `j`, then `i` is equal to `j`
- The current value of `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`
- If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `cp1` is `(x1, y1)` and `cp2` is `(x1, y1)`
- Otherwise, `th` is 0.0, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(al), y1 - math.sin(al))`
- If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` is a list containing `[(x1, y1)]`
- Otherwise, `cross_points` remains an empty list
- Additionally, `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`

Since `cp2` is defined and meets the criteria (i.e., `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`), it will be appended to `cross_points`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `cross_points` is now a list containing `[(x1, y1), cp2]`

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
