According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num_data`. The loop iterates `num_data` times, and at the end of each iteration, the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be greater than the current value of the loop counter.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10.
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`.
- `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`.
- `num_data` must be greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing one tuple of floats read from standard input.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- `num_data` must be greater than the current value of the loop counter.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`, `num_data` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list containing one tuple of floats read from standard input.**
