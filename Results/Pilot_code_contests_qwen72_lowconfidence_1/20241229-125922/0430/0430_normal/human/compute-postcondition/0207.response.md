To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the list `data`, which is a list of tuples of floats. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `data`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
   - `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
   - `num_data` is at least 2.
   - `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of floats read from standard input.
   - `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
   - `max_overlap` is less than `count` if it was less before, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged.
   - If the distance between the point `(cx, cy)` and the point `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there is another tuple `(x, y)` in the list `data`.
   - Since `data` is a list of tuples, the next iteration will use the next tuple in the list.

Given the current state, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the next tuple `(x, y)` from the list `data`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is less than `count` if it was less before, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged, the next tuple `(x, y)` in `data` is the next element in the list.**
