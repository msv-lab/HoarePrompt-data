Functionality: ** The function reads a series of coordinates from the standard input, representing the centers of circular stickers placed on a square origami paper with side length 10. It calculates the maximum number of stickers that can overlap at any single point on the paper, considering the intersection points of circles with a slightly larger radius (approximately 2 units). The function then prints this maximum overlap count. If no intersections occur or if no data is provided, the function prints 0. Edge cases include scenarios where no stickers are provided (`num_data` is 0) or where the circles do not intersect within the bounds of the paper. The function ensures that all coordinates are within the specified range and that no two stickers share the same coordinates. **
