To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `num_data` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `num_data - 1`.
- The list `data` should have at least one tuple for the loop to execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `num_data` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will start at 0.
- `data` must contain at least one tuple.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
