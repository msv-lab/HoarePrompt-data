The code appends a new tuple of floats to the `data` list, which is generated by reading a line from standard input and splitting it by commas, then converting each split string into a float.

- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `xi` and `yi` remain real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` remains `1.000000000001`.
- `RADIUS_2` remains `2.000000000001`.
- `num_data` remains greater than 1.
- `data` now contains one additional tuple of floats read from standard input, making the total number of tuples in `data` equal to `num_data`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`, `num_data` is greater than 1, `data` is a list containing one additional tuple of floats read from standard input.**
