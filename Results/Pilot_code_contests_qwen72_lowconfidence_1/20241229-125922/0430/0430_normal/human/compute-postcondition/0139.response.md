The given code snippet calculates the angle `al` using the formula for the arccosine of a value derived from the squared distance between the centers of two circles divided by twice the distance.

Given:
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the centers of the circles at indices 2 and 0 in `data`.
- The formula used is `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`.

Let's break down the calculation:
1. `distance ** 2` computes the square of the distance.
2. `2.0 * distance` multiplies the distance by 2.
3. `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)` simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.

Thus, the expression `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` simplifies to `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

Since `distance` is the distance between the centers of the circles, and it is given that this distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2` (which is 2.000000000001), the value of `distance / 2.0` will be less than or equal to 1. This ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range for the arccosine function.

Therefore, `al` is assigned the value `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
