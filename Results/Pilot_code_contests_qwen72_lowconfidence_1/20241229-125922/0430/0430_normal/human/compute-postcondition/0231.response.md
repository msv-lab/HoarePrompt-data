The value of `max_overlap` is updated to the current value of `count`. Since the current value of `count` is greater than the current value of `max_overlap`, this update ensures that `max_overlap` now holds the highest number of points in `data` that are within a distance `RADIUS` from the point `(cx, cy)` encountered so far.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), and no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 1 valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `count` is the number of points in `data` that are within a distance `RADIUS` from the point `(cx, cy)`, `max_overlap` is equal to the current value of `count`.**
