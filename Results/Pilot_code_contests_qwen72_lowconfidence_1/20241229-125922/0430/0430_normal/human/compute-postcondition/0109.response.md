To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions under which the loop continues:

### Current State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` is 1.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- `num_data` must be greater than 1.
- `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`.
- `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`.
- `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(num_data):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(num_data)`, which means `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `num_data - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1 (since `i` is 1 and `j` starts from 0).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2.
- `x2` becomes the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `y2` becomes the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `distance` is recalculated as the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).

### Final State:
