Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. If `i == j`, `cross_points` remains unchanged and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - y1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\), and if \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\), `cross_points` now includes `cp1`, if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `cross_points` now includes `cp2`. If `distance` is greater than `RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains unchanged.***
