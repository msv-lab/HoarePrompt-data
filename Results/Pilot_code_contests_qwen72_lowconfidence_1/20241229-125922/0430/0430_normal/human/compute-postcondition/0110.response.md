The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically cause a syntax error if it was not part of a loop. For the purpose of this simulation, we will assume that the `continue` statement is part of a larger loop context that is not shown here.

Given this, the `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables directly. It only affects the flow of the loop it is part of. Since no changes are made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); no two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\).**
