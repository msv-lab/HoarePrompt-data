The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the assumption is that this `continue` is part of an existing loop structure outside the given snippet. As such, the `continue` statement itself does not alter any variable values; it only affects the flow of control.

Given the initial state, the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow indicates that the program moves to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any subsequent code in the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `j` is 2, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, if `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - y1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\), if \(0.0 \leq cp1[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp1[1] \leq 10.0\), `cross_points` now includes `cp1`, if \(0.0 \leq cp2[0] \leq 10.0\) and \(0.0 \leq cp2[1] \leq 10.0\), `cross_points` now includes `cp2`, if `distance` is greater than `RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
