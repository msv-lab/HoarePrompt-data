To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), and no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is at least 2.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` contains at least 1 valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- `max_overlap` is equal to `count` if `max_overlap` was less than `count` before the if statement, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged.
- `count` is 0.
- `(cx, cy)` is the next tuple in `cross_points`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`data`**: The for loop iterates over the list `data`. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one tuple. Given that `num_data` is at least 2, `data` will always contain at least 2 tuples. Therefore, `data` is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once.

2. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `cross_points`, `max_overlap`, `count`, `(cx, cy)`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop. They are used within the loop body or are part of the initial state but do not control the loop's execution.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `data` contains at least one tuple. Since `num_data` is at least 2, this condition is already met.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), and no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 1 valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is equal to `count` if `max_overlap` was less than `count` before the if statement, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged, `count` is 0, `(cx, cy)` is the next tuple in `cross_points`**.
