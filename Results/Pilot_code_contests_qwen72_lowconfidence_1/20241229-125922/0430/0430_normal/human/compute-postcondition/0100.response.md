The given code snippet calculates the angle `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. This formula simplifies to `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
- The value of `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\), which is already calculated.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `al` and all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); No two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`**
