The code appends `cp2` to the list `cross_points`. The value of `cp2` is calculated based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance`. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `distance` are derived from the `data` list, which contains tuples of coordinates. The values of `cp1` and `cp2` are computed based on trigonometric functions and the given `distance`.

Given the initial state, the only change is the addition of `cp2` to the `cross_points` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`. If `x1 == x2 and y1 == y2`, then `cp1` and `cp2` are both set to `(x1, y1)`. Otherwise, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al))`. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` contains the value of `cp1`. `cross_points` also contains the value of `cp2`.**
