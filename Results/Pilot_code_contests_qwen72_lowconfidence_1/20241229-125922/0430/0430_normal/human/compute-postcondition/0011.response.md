The code initializes an empty list named `cross_points`. This does not affect any of the existing variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same except for the addition of the new variable `cross_points`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`, `num_data` is a non-negative integer, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` is an empty list.**
