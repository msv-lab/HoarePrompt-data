To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is at least 2.
- `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- `max_overlap` is less than `count` if it was less before, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged.
- The next tuple `(x, y)` in `data` is the next element in the list.
- If the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is increased by 1.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`data`**: The loop iterates over the elements in `data`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `data`.
2. **`x` and `y`**: These are the coordinates of the current element in `data`. They will be updated to the next tuple in `data` at the start of the next iteration.
3. **`count`**: This variable is incremented based on the condition inside the loop. However, for the purpose of determining the next state, we assume `count` remains unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.
4. **`max_overlap`**: This variable is compared with `count` and updated accordingly. It remains unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Adjusted States:
- The next tuple `(x, y)` in `data` will be the next element in the list.
- The loop will execute one more time if there is at least one more tuple in `data`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is less than `count` if it was less before, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged, the next tuple `(x, y)` in `data` is the next element in the list. If the distance between `(cx, cy)` and `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`, `count` is increased by 1.**
