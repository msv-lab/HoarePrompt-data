The code snippet `al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))` calculates the value of `al` using the inverse cosine function (`math.acos`) and the given formula.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Distance Calculation**: The variable `distance` is already defined as `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
2. **Formula Application**: The formula `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)` simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.
3. **Inverse Cosine Calculation**: The value of `al` is calculated as `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

### Updated Variable Values:
- `al` is now assigned the value `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` remain real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` remains \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` remains \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` remains a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` remains a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` remains 0.
- `x1` remains the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `y1` remains the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `j` remains 2.
- `x2` remains the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `y2` remains the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
- `distance` remains `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
