The code calculates a new point `cp1` which is an intersection point between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and another circle centered at `(x2, y2)` with the same radius. The calculation uses trigonometric functions to find the coordinates of this intersection point.

Given the initial state, the following steps occur:

1. `cp1` is calculated using the formula provided, which involves the cosine and sine of the angles `th + al`.
2. The angle `th` is the arctangent of the difference in y-coordinates divided by the difference in x-coordinates, representing the direction from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)`.
3. The angle `al` is the arccosine of half the distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, representing the angle needed to reach the intersection point from the line connecting the two centers.
4. The new point `cp1` is a tuple containing the calculated x and y coordinates.

The updated state includes the new value of `cp1`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); No two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.**
