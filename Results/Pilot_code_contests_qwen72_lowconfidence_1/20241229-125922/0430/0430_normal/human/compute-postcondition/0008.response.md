To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is controlled by `num_data`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `range(num_data)`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10.
   - No two stickers have the same coordinates.
   - `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`.
   - `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`.
   - `num_data` is greater than 1.
   - `data` is a list containing one additional tuple of floats read from standard input.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(num_data)`, the loop counter `_` will increment by 1 each time the loop runs.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num_data` must be greater than the current iteration count.

Given that `num_data` is greater than 1 and the loop has already run once, `num_data` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the loop counter `_`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`, `num_data` is greater than 1, `data` is a list containing one additional tuple of floats read from standard input, `_` is 1**.
