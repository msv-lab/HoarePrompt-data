The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of datasets, where each dataset contains pairs of real numbers `(xi, yi)` representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with the constraints 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10 and no two stickers having the same coordinates.

The function's output is not specified in the provided context, so I cannot definitively state what it returns. However, typically in such scenarios, the function might return some form of analysis or processing result based on the input data, such as the number of overlapping stickers, the distance between certain stickers, or any other relevant metric.

Given the lack of specific output details, I will provide a general description:

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of datasets, where each dataset contains pairs of real numbers `(xi, yi)` representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the coordinates provided, ensuring that no two stickers have the same coordinates and all coordinates lie within the square origami paper with side length 10.**
