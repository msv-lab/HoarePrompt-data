`cp1` is calculated using the formula `x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)`. Given that `th` is 0.0 and `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, the new value of `cp1` is `(x1 + math.cos(0.0 + math.acos(distance / 2.0)), y1 + math.sin(0.0 + math.acos(distance / 2.0)))`.

The cosine and sine functions simplify to:
- `math.cos(math.acos(distance / 2.0))` is equal to `distance / 2.0`.
- `math.sin(math.acos(distance / 2.0))` is equal to the positive square root of `1 - (distance / 2.0)**2`.

Thus, `cp1` is `(x1 + distance / 2.0, y1 + sqrt(1 - (distance / 2.0)**2))`.

The other variables remain unchanged.
