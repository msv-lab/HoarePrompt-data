The given code snippet calculates the angle `al` using the formula `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- The variable `al` is calculated using the inverse cosine function (`math.acos`) applied to the result of the expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`.
- Simplifying the expression inside `math.acos`, we get `distance / 2.0`.

Given that `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) and is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, the value of `distance / 2.0` will be a valid input for the `math.acos` function, which returns an angle in radians.

Therefore, the variable `al` is now set to the value of `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
