The given code snippet calculates the angle `al` using the inverse cosine function (`acos`) from the `math` module. The argument to `acos` is the result of the expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)`. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. **Calculate the Argument to `acos`:**
   - The expression `distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance)` simplifies to `distance / 2.0`.

2. **Compute `al`:**
   - `al` is assigned the value of `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.

Given the initial state, let's summarize the output state:

- `n` remains a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` remain real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` remains \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` remains \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` remains a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` remains a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `i` remains 0.
- `x1` remains the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `y1` remains the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `j` remains 1.
- `x2` remains the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `y2` remains the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`.
- `distance` remains `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
- `th` remains `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`.
- `al` is now `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`.
