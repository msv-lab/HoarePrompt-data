The code snippet assigns the first tuple in the list `data` to the variables `x1` and `y1`. The variables `x1` and `y1` will now hold the first and second elements of the tuple located at index `i` (which is 0) in the list `data`.

Given the initial state, the following remains unchanged:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\)
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple
- `cross_points` is an empty list
- `i` is 0

The updated values are:
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`**
