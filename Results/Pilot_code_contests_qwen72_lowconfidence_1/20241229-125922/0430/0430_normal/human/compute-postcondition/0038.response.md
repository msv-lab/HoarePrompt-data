Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`. If `i` is equal to `j`, `distance` is 0, and if `distance` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, and if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, then `cross_points` is a list containing `[(x1, y1)]`. Otherwise, `th` is 0.0, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, and `cp2` is `(x1 + math.cos(al), y1 - math.sin(al))`. If `0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0`, then `cross_points` is a list containing `[(x1, y1)]`. If `0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0` and `0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0`, `cross_points` is updated to contain `[(x1, y1), cp2]`. Otherwise, `cross_points` remains a list containing `[(x1, y1)]`. If `distance` is greater than `RADIUS_2`, `cross_points` remains an empty list. If `i` is not equal to `j`, the state remains unchanged.***
