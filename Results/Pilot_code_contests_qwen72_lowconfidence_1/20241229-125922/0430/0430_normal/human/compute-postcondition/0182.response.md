To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Variables:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
   - `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
   - `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
   - `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
   - `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
   - `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
   - `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `num_data - 1`.
   - For each `j`, if `i == j`, the iteration is skipped.
   - For each valid `j` (where `i != j`):
     - `x2` and `y2` are set to the first and second elements of the tuple at index `j` in `data`.
     - The distance between the centers of the circles at \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is calculated using `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`.
     - If the distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`:
       - If `x1 == x2` and `y1 == y2`, both `cp1` and `cp2` are set to \((x1, y1)\).
       - Otherwise, the angle `th` and the angle `al` are calculated.
       - `cp1` and `cp2` are computed as the intersection points.
       - If the coordinates of `cp1` and `cp2` lie within the bounds of the square origami paper, they are added to `cross_points`.

3. **Final Output State:**
   - After the loop finishes, `n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, and `data` retain their initial values.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `x1` and `y1` remain the first and second elements of the tuple at index 2 in `data`.
   - `cross_points` contains all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
