To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop will execute based on the value of `num_data`.

### Analysis:
- The loop is defined as `for _ in range(num_data):`, which means the loop will execute `num_data` times.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `num_data` must be greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`.
- `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`.
- `num_data` is an input integer.
- `data` is an empty list.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `num_data` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`.
- `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`.
- `num_data` must be greater than 0.
- `data` is an empty list.
