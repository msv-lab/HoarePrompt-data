The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end immediately and moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, we can infer that this statement would typically cause the program to skip the rest of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration. However, since we don't have the loop context, the `continue` statement does not affect the variables or their values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `j` is 1, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, `cp1` and `cp2` are calculated based on the conditions provided, and `cross_points` may include `cp1` and/or `cp2` if they satisfy the conditions.**
