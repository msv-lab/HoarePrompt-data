The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. Since this statement is not inside a loop, its effect is undefined in this context, but typically, `continue` would only have an effect when used within a loop. Given the context, we assume the `continue` statement is intended to skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

However, since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables. The state remains the same as it was before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 0, and `i` is equal to `j`.**
