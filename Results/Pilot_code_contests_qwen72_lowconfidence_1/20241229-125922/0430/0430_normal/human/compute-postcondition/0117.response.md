The code snippet `cp1 = x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)` calculates the coordinates of a point `cp1` that lies on the circumference of a circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with a radius determined by the angle `th + al`.

1. **Calculation of `cp1`**:
   - `cp1` is a tuple consisting of two elements:
     - The first element is `x1 + math.cos(th + al)`, which represents the x-coordinate of the new point.
     - The second element is `y1 + math.sin(th + al)`, which represents the y-coordinate of the new point.
   - The angle `th + al` is used to determine the direction from the point `(x1, y1)`.

2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variable `cp1` is introduced and assigned the value `(x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `data`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `cross_points`, `x2`, `y2`, `distance`, `th`, `al`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\); `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\); no two stickers have the same coordinates; `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\); `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\); `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0; `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple; `i` is 1; `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `data`; `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper; `num_data` must be greater than 1; `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index `j` in `data`; `distance` is the Euclidean distance between the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `th` is the angle (in radians) between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\); `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`. `cp1` is \((x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al))\).**
