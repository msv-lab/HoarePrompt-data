The code snippet reads a line from standard input, splits it by commas, converts each part to a float, and appends the resulting tuple to the `data` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ `xi`, `yi` ≤ 10, no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is `1.000000000001`, `RADIUS_2` is `2.000000000001`, `num_data` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list containing one tuple of floats read from standard input.**
