The code snippet assigns the values from the tuple at index `j` in the `data` list to the variables `x2` and `y2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\)
- No two stickers have the same coordinates
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\)
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple
- `cross_points` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`
- `j` is 0
- If `i` is equal to `j`, then `i` is equal to `j`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x2` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `j` (which is 0) in `data`
- `y2` is assigned the second element of the tuple at index `j` (which is 0) in `data`

Since `j` is 0, `x2` and `y2` are assigned the same values as `x1` and `y1`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `cross_points` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, and if `i` is equal to `j`, then `i` is equal to `j`.**
