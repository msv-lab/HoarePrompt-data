To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\).
- No two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is at least 2.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- If `max_overlap` is less than `count`, then `max_overlap` is updated to be equal to `count`. Otherwise, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for (cx, cy) in cross_points:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(cx, cy)` in the list `cross_points`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point.
   - The loop has already processed one or more points in `cross_points`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**:
   - `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point.
   - The loop has processed one point, so there are at least `len(cross_points) - 1` points left to process.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more point in `cross_points` to process.
   - Therefore, `cross_points` must contain at least 2 valid intersection points.

### Adjusted State:
- `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points.
- The next point to be processed is the second point in `cross_points`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 2 valid intersection points between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper. If `max_overlap` is less than `count`, then `max_overlap` is updated to be equal to `count`. Otherwise, `max_overlap` remains unchanged.**
