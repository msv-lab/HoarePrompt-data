To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have completed, we need to consider the initial state and how the loop modifies the variables. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple.
- `cross_points` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.
- `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(num_data):
    if i == j:
        continue
    x2, y2 = data[j]
    distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
    if distance <= RADIUS_2:
        if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
            cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1
        else:
            th = math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)
            al = math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))
            cp1 = x1 + math.cos(th + al), y1 + math.sin(th + al)
            cp2 = x1 + math.cos(th - al), y1 + math.sin(th - al)
        if 0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0:
            cross_points.append(cp1)
        if 0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0:
            cross_points.append(cp2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each index `j` in the range from 0 to `num_data - 1`.
   - If `i` equals `j`, the iteration is skipped (`continue`).
   - For each valid `j`, the loop calculates the distance between the coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.
   - If the distance is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, the loop calculates the intersection points `cp1` and `cp2` and adds them to `cross_points` if they lie within the bounds of the square origami paper.

2. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` remains 0.
   - `x1` and `y1` remain the first element and second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, respectively.
   - `cross_points` will contain all valid intersection points calculated during the loop.

### Output State:
**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at `(x1, y1)` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.**
