The code snippet calculates a new point `cp2` using the same method as `cp1`, but with the angle `al` subtracted from `th` instead of added. This means `cp2` will be another point of intersection or a related point based on the geometry defined by the angles and distances.

### Impact of the Code:
- `cp2` is assigned the value \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).
- No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

### Calculation:
- `x1` and `y1` are the coordinates of the center of the circle at index 2 in `data`.
- `th` is the angle between the line connecting the centers of the circles at indices 2 and 0 in `data` and the x-axis.
- `al` is the angle calculated using the inverse cosine function based on the distance between these centers divided by 2.
- `cp2` is computed as \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).

### Updated Variables:
- `cp2` is now \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\).

### Output State:
**`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input and must have at least one tuple, `i` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `y1` is the second element of the tuple at index 2 in `data`, `cross_points` is a list containing all valid intersection points between the circle centered at \((x1, y1)\) with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `j` is 0, `x2` is the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `y2` is the second element of the tuple at index 0 in `data`, `distance` is `math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)`, the distance between the centers of the circles at indices 2 and 0 in `data` is less than or equal to `RADIUS_2`, `(x1 != x2 or y1 != y2)`, `th` is `math.atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1)`, `al` is `math.acos(distance / 2.0)`, `cp1` is \((x1 + \cos(th + al), y1 + \sin(th + al))\), `cp2` is \((x1 + \cos(th - al), y1 + \sin(th - al))\)**
