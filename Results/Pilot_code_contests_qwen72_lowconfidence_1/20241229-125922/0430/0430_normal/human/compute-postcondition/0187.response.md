To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State Before the Loop:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\)
- No two stickers have the same coordinates
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\)
- `num_data` is at least 2
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input
- `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper
- `max_overlap` is 0
- `count` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `data` is not empty. Since `num_data` is at least 2, `data` must contain at least 2 tuples.
2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `data` must contain at least 2 tuples of floats.
   - The loop variable `(x, y)` should be initialized to the first tuple in `data`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\)
- No two stickers have the same coordinates
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\)
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\)
- `num_data` is at least 2
- `data` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of floats read from standard input
- `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper
- `max_overlap` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `(x, y)` is the first tuple in `data`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least one valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is 0, `count` is 0, `(x, y)` is the first tuple in `data`**
