To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), and no two stickers have the same coordinates.
- `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\).
- `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\).
- `num_data` is at least 2.
- `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input.
- `cross_points` contains at least 1 valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper.
- `max_overlap` is equal to `count` if `max_overlap` was less than `count` before the if statement, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged.
- `count` is 1 if the distance between the point `(cx, cy)` and the point `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.
- `data` contains at least one more tuple to be processed.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in data:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(x, y)` in the list `data`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `data` must still contain at least one more tuple to be processed for the loop to execute again.
   - The tuple `(x, y)` is the current element being processed, and it will be different in the next iteration.
   - Other variables (`n`, `xi`, `yi`, `RADIUS`, `RADIUS_2`, `num_data`, `cross_points`, `max_overlap`, `count`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain as they are.

### Adjusted State:
- The next tuple `(x, y)` will be the next element in the list `data`.
- `data` must contain at least one more tuple to be processed.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 100\), `xi` and `yi` are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., \(0 \leq xi, yi \leq 10\), and no two stickers have the same coordinates, `RADIUS` is \(1.000000000001\), `RADIUS_2` is \(2.000000000001\), `num_data` is at least 2, `data` is a list containing `num_data` tuples of floats read from standard input, `cross_points` contains at least 1 valid intersection point between circles centered at points in `data` with radius `RADIUS_2` and circles centered at other points in `data` with the same radius, where each intersection point lies within the bounds of the square origami paper, `max_overlap` is equal to `count` if `max_overlap` was less than `count` before the if statement, otherwise `max_overlap` remains unchanged, `count` is 1 if the distance between the point `(cx, cy)` and the point `(x, y)` is less than or equal to `RADIUS`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0, and `data` contains at least one more tuple to be processed. The next tuple `(x, y)` is the next element in the list `data`.**
