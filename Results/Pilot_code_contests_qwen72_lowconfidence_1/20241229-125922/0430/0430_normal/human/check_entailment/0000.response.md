Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it calculates the intersection points of the circles. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the angle `al` is incorrect. The correct formula for the angle `al` should be derived from the law of cosines, but the current implementation uses a simplified and incorrect formula. This can lead to incorrect intersection points being calculated, which would affect the final count of the maximum overlap.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the circles are tangent (distance between centers is exactly 2). According to the problem statement, tangent circles should be considered as overlapping, but the current implementation might miss this case due to the small tolerance added to the distance check (`RADIUS_2`).

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
2
1.0, 1.0
3.0, 1.0
```
The distance between the centers of these two circles is exactly 2, so they should be considered overlapping. However, the program might not correctly identify this case due to the incorrect calculation of intersection points and the tolerance used.
