Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the centers of the circles are exactly 2 units apart (i.e., the circles are just touching but not overlapping). According to the problem description, when the distance between the centers is 2, the stickers are assumed to overlap. However, the program uses `RADIUS_2 = 2 + 1e-12`, which means it only considers circles to be overlapping if the distance between their centers is less than 2 (plus a very small tolerance). This means that if the distance is exactly 2, the program will incorrectly treat the circles as not overlapping.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
1.0, 1.0
3.0, 1.0
0
```

In this case, the distance between the centers of the two circles is exactly 2, so they should be considered overlapping. However, the program will not count them as overlapping because the distance is not less than `2 + 1e-12`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
