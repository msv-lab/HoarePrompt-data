Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Intersection Points:**
   - The program attempts to find intersection points of the circles using a formula for the intersection of two circles. However, the formula used is incorrect. The calculation of the angles and the intersection points does not correctly account for the geometry of the problem.
   - Specifically, the angle `al` is calculated using `math.acos(distance ** 2 / (2.0 * distance))`, which is mathematically incorrect. The correct formula for the angle `al` should be `math.acos(1 - (distance ** 2) / 4)`.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the circles are tangent (distance exactly 2), which should also be considered as overlapping.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Overlap:**
   - The program checks if a point is within a distance of `RADIUS` (1 + 1e-12) from the center of a circle to count it as an overlap. However, the problem description states that two circles are considered to overlap if the distance between their centers is less than or equal to 2. The program should check if the distance between the centers is less than or equal to 2, not if a point is within a distance of 1 from the center.
   - The program also does not consider the possibility that the maximum overlap might occur at the center of one of the circles, not just at the intersection points.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where no stickers are provided (`num_data` is 0) correctly. In this case, the program should print 0, but it does not explicitly handle this case.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the input coordinates.
2. For each pair of circles, check if they overlap (distance between centers â‰¤ 2).
3. If they overlap, calculate the intersection points and store them.
4. Check each intersection point and each circle center to count the number of stickers that overlap at that point.
5. Print the maximum overlap count.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin
import math

def func():
    RADIUS = 1
    RADIUS_2 = 2
    num_data = int(stdin.readline())
    if num_data == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    data = [tuple(float(s) for s in stdin.readline().split(',')) for _ in range(num_data)]
    
    cross_points = []
    for i in range(num_data):
        x1, y1 = data[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, num_data):
            x2, y2 = data[j]
            distance = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
            if distance <= RADIUS_2:
                if distance == 0:
                    cp1 = cp2 = x1, y1
                else:
                    d = distance
                    x = (RADIUS_2**2 - d**2 + RADIUS_2**2) / (2 * d)
                    h = math.sqrt(RADIUS_2**2 - x**2)
                    x3 = x1 + x * (x2 - x1) / d
                    y3 = y1 + x * (y2 - y1) / d
                    cp1 = x3 + h * (y2 - y1) / d, y3 - h * (x2 - x1) / d
                    cp2 = x3 - h * (y2 - y1) / d, y3 + h * (x2 - x1) / d
                if 0.0 <= cp1[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp1[1] <= 10.0:
                    cross_points.append(cp1)
                if 0.0 <= cp2[0] <= 10.0 and 0.0 <= cp2[1] <= 10.0:
                    cross_points.append(cp2)
    
    max_overlap = 0
    for (cx, cy) in cross_points + data:
        count = sum(1 for x, y in data if math.hypot(cx - x, cy - y) <= RADIUS)
        if max_overlap < count:
            max_overlap = count
    
    print(max_overlap)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the intersection points and checks for overlaps, ensuring that the program meets the problem description.
