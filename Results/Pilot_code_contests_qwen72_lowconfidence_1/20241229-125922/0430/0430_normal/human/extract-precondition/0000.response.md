Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 100. For each dataset, xi and yi are real numbers representing the coordinates of the center of the i-th sticker, with up to 6 digits after the decimal point, and all centers lie within the square origami paper with side length 10, i.e., 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 10. No two stickers have the same coordinates.**
