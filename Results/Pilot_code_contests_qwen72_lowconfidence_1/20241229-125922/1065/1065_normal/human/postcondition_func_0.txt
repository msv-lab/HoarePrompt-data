This function reads input from standard input, expecting a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list to determine if it can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0. If at any point during processing, it finds that the sequence cannot be reduced to such a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and terminates the program. If the sequence can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0, it prints 'YES'. The final state of the program is that either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the standard output, and the program terminates.
