Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array has multiple segments of equal height that cannot be uniformly increased to match the maximum height. For example, consider the input:

```
5
2 1 1 2 4
```

In this case, the program will output `NO`, but the correct output should be `YES` because Vova can place bricks on the segments `[2, 1, 1, 2]` to make them all `3`, and then place more bricks to make all segments `4`.

This shows that the program fails to correctly identify scenarios where multiple segments of equal height can be uniformly increased to match the maximum height, leading to incorrect results.
