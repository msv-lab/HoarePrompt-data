You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova's family is building the Great Vova Wall (named by Vova himself). Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.

The current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence a of n integers, with a_i being the height of the i-th part of the wall.

Vova can only use 2 × 1 bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).

Vova can put bricks only horizontally on the neighbouring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some i the current height of part i is the same as for part i + 1, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part 1 of the wall or to the right of part n of it).

Note that Vova can't put bricks vertically.

Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:

  * all parts of the wall has the same height; 
  * the wall has no empty spaces inside it. 



Can Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of parts in the wall.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the initial heights of the parts of the wall.

Output

Print "YES" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).

Print "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 2 5


Output


YES


Input


3
4 5 3


Output


NO


Input


2
10 10


Output


YES

Note

In the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall [2, 2, 2, 2, 5] and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

In the second example Vova can put no bricks in the wall.

In the third example the wall is already complete.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys,math
from collections import defaultdict
from io import BytesIO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    h = max(arr)
    res = list()
    for el in arr:
        if len(res) == 0 or res[-1] != el:
            if len(res) > 0:
                if res[-1] < el:
                    print('NO')
                    exit()
            res.append(el)
        else:
            res.pop()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - If the loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed.
    #   - If the loop completes without exiting early, `res` will contain a non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:
    #
    #Output State:
    if (len(res) > 1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if (len(res) == 0) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO' if res[-1] < h else 'YES')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *The loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed, or if the loop completes without exiting early, `res` will contain a non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`. Additionally, the length of `res` is less than or equal to 1. If the length of `res` is 0, 'YES' has been printed. If the length of `res` is greater than 0, the program may have terminated with 'NO' being printed or `res` contains a valid non-decreasing subsequence.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If the length of `res` is greater than 1, 'NO' has been printed. If the length of `res` is 0, 'YES' has been printed. If the length of `res` is 1, the program may have terminated with 'NO' being printed, or `res` contains a valid non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
