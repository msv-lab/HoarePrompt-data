Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Brick Placement**: The code attempts to reduce the array to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0, which is not the correct approach for this problem. The problem requires Vova to place bricks horizontally on neighboring parts of the wall of equal height to make all parts of the wall the same height. The code does not check if it's possible to make all parts of the wall the same height by placing bricks in this manner.

2. **Handling of Equal Heights**: The code incorrectly handles the placement of bricks. It removes elements from the list (`res.pop()`) when consecutive elements are equal, which is not the correct way to simulate placing bricks. Instead, it should check if it's possible to make all parts of the wall the same height by placing bricks on consecutive equal-height segments.

3. **Final Check**: The final check in the code (`if len(res) > 1: print('NO')`) is not appropriate. The correct condition should be to check if it's possible to make all parts of the wall the same height, which is not what the code is doing.

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 2 1 1
```
The correct output should be `NO` because it's impossible to make all parts of the wall the same height by placing bricks horizontally on neighboring parts of equal height. However, the provided code might output `YES` or `NO` incorrectly due to its flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Identify segments of the wall where the height is the same.
2. Check if it's possible to make all segments the same height by placing bricks on these segments.
3. Ensure that after placing bricks, the entire wall has the same height.

The provided code does not follow this approach and thus is incorrect.
