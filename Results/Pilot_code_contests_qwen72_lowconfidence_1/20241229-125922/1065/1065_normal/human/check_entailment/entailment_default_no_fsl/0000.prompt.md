You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova's family is building the Great Vova Wall (named by Vova himself). Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.

The current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence a of n integers, with a_i being the height of the i-th part of the wall.

Vova can only use 2 × 1 bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).

Vova can put bricks only horizontally on the neighbouring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some i the current height of part i is the same as for part i + 1, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part 1 of the wall or to the right of part n of it).

Note that Vova can't put bricks vertically.

Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:

  * all parts of the wall has the same height; 
  * the wall has no empty spaces inside it. 



Can Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of parts in the wall.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the initial heights of the parts of the wall.

Output

Print "YES" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).

Print "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 2 5


Output


YES


Input


3
4 5 3


Output


NO


Input


2
10 10


Output


YES

Note

In the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall [2, 2, 2, 2, 5] and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

In the second example Vova can put no bricks in the wall.

In the third example the wall is already complete.
Program:
```
import sys,math
from collections import defaultdict
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    h = max(arr)
    res = list()
    for el in arr:
        if len(res) == 0 or res[-1] != el:
            if len(res) > 0:
                if res[-1] < el:
                    print('NO')
                    exit()
            res.append(el)
        else:
            res.pop()
    if len(res) > 1:
        print('NO')
    elif len(res) == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO' if res[-1] < h else 'YES')


```
Output hints: This function reads input from standard input, expecting a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list to determine if it can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0. If at any point during processing, it finds that the sequence cannot be reduced to such a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and terminates the program. If the sequence can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0, it prints 'YES'. The final state of the program is that either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the standard output, and the program terminates.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
