You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova's family is building the Great Vova Wall (named by Vova himself). Vova's parents, grandparents, grand-grandparents contributed to it. Now it's totally up to Vova to put the finishing touches.

The current state of the wall can be respresented by a sequence a of n integers, with a_i being the height of the i-th part of the wall.

Vova can only use 2 × 1 bricks to put in the wall (he has infinite supply of them, however).

Vova can put bricks only horizontally on the neighbouring parts of the wall of equal height. It means that if for some i the current height of part i is the same as for part i + 1, then Vova can put a brick there and thus increase both heights by 1. Obviously, Vova can't put bricks in such a way that its parts turn out to be off the borders (to the left of part 1 of the wall or to the right of part n of it).

Note that Vova can't put bricks vertically.

Vova is a perfectionist, so he considers the wall completed when:

  * all parts of the wall has the same height; 
  * the wall has no empty spaces inside it. 



Can Vova complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of parts in the wall.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the initial heights of the parts of the wall.

Output

Print "YES" if Vova can complete the wall using any amount of bricks (possibly zero).

Print "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 2 5


Output


YES


Input


3
4 5 3


Output


NO


Input


2
10 10


Output


YES

Note

In the first example Vova can put a brick on parts 2 and 3 to make the wall [2, 2, 2, 2, 5] and then put 3 bricks on parts 1 and 2 and 3 bricks on parts 3 and 4 to make it [5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

In the second example Vova can put no bricks in the wall.

In the third example the wall is already complete.
Program:
```
import sys,math
from collections import defaultdict
from io import BytesIO

def func():
    sys.stdin = BytesIO(sys.stdin.read())
    input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    h = max(arr)
    res = list()
    for el in arr:
        if len(res) == 0 or res[-1] != el:
            if len(res) > 0:
                if res[-1] < el:
                    print('NO')
                    exit()
            res.append(el)
        else:
            res.pop()
    if len(res) > 1:
        print('NO')
    elif len(res) == 0:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO' if res[-1] < h else 'YES')


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
