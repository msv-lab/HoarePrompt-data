Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the wall can be completed by adding bricks to parts of the wall that are initially of different heights but can be made equal by adding bricks. Specifically, the program fails to consider that Vova can add bricks to make adjacent parts of the wall equal before proceeding to make the entire wall uniform.

Example of a failing case:
```
Input:
4
1 2 2 1

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, Vova can add a brick to the first and second parts of the wall, making the wall `[2, 3, 2, 1]`. Then, he can add a brick to the third and fourth parts, making the wall `[2, 3, 3, 2]`. Finally, he can add a brick to the first and second parts, and another to the third and fourth parts, making the wall `[3, 4, 4, 3]`, and then add a final brick to the first and second parts, and another to the third and fourth parts, making the wall `[4, 5, 5, 4]`. This process can continue until all parts of the wall are of equal height, which is possible in this case. However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO`.
