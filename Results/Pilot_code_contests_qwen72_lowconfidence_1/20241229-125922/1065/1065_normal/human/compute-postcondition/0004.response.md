The code snippet `h = max(arr)` assigns the maximum value in the list `arr` to the variable `h`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.
- `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters.
- `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.

After executing `h = max(arr)`, the variable `h` is assigned the maximum value from the list `arr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`.**
