The code `res.append(el)` appends the value of `el` to the list `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.
- `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters.
- `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.
- `h` is the maximum value in `arr`.
- `res` is a list, and `el` is the first element in `arr`.
- If `len(res) > 0`, `res` is a non-empty list and the last element in `res` is not equal to `el`.
- If `res[-1] < el`, the program has terminated, and all variables retain their initial state up to the point of termination.
- If `len(res) == 0`, `res` remains an empty list.

After executing `res.append(el)`, the value of `el` (which is the first element in `arr`) is appended to `res`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.
- `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters.
- `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.
- `h` is the maximum value in `arr`.
- `res` is a list containing the first element of `arr`.
- `el` is the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`, `res` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `el` is the first element in `arr`.**
