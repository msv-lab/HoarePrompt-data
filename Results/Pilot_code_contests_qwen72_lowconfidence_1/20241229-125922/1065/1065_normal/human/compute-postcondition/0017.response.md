Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`, `el` is the first element in `arr`. If `len(res) == 0` or `res[-1] != el`, then `res` is a list containing the first element of `arr`. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.***
