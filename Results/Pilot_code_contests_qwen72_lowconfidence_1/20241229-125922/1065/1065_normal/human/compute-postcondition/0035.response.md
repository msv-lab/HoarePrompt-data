Postcondition: ***If the loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed. If the loop completes without exiting early, `res` will contain a non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`. The current length of `res` is greater than 1.***
