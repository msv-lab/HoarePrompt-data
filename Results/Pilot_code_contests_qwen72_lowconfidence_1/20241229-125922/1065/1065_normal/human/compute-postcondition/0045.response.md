Functionality: ** This function reads input from standard input, expecting a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list to determine if it can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0. If at any point during processing, it finds that the sequence cannot be reduced to such a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and terminates the program. If the sequence can be reduced to a non-decreasing subsequence of length 1 or 0, it prints 'YES'. The final state of the program is that either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed to the standard output, and the program terminates. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If the input list is empty or contains only one element, the function will print 'YES'.
- If the input list contains duplicate consecutive elements, the function will remove them, potentially affecting the final subsequence.
- The function assumes that the input is always valid (i.e., `n` and `a_i` are within the specified bounds), and it does not handle invalid input explicitly.
- The function terminates early with 'NO' if it detects an increasing element in the sequence, which ensures that the final subsequence remains non-decreasing.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not properly formatted (e.g., non-integer values or incorrect number of elements).
