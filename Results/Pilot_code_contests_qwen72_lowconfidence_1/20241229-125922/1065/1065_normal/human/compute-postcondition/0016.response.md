The code `res.pop()` removes the last element from the list `res`. Given that the last element in `res` is equal to `el`, after executing this code, `res` will no longer contain `el`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`, `res` is an empty list, `el` is the first element in `arr`**.
