The code snippet redefines the `input` function to read a line from `sys.stdin`, stripping the newline character (`'\n'`) and the carriage return (`'\r'`) if present.

- The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within a specified range, and `a` is a list of integers, each within its own specified range. The `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.
- Redefining `input` does not change the values of `n` or `a`.
- The new `input` function is now ready to read lines from the `BytesIO` object, but no actual reading or processing of input occurs in this snippet.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged in terms of the values of `n` and `a`, but the behavior of the `input` function has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters.**
