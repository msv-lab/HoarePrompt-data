The code snippet reads a line from `sys.stdin` using the `input` function, splits the line into multiple strings based on spaces, and then converts each string into an integer to form a list called `arr`.

- `arr` is now a list of integers obtained from the input line.
- The length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in `arr` corresponds to an integer from the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the integer read from `sys.stdin` and is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is now a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length `n` and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`.**
