Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length \(n\) and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`, `el` is the next element in `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time. If `len(res) == 0` or `res[-1] != el`, `res` is a list with an additional element `el` appended to it. If `len(res) > 0` and `res[-1] < el`, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated. Otherwise, if `len(res) > 0` and `res[-1] == el`, `res` is the list with its last element removed.***
