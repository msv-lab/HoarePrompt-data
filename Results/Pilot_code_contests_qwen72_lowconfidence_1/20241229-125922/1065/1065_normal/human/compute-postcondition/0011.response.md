The `exit()` function causes the program to terminate immediately. This means no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program ends.

Output State: **Program has terminated, all variables (`n`, `a`, `sys.stdin`, `input`, `arr`, `h`, `res`, `el`) retain their initial state up to the point of termination.**
