The code snippet changes the standard input stream (`sys.stdin`) to a `BytesIO` object initialized with the current contents of the standard input stream. This means that subsequent reads from `sys.stdin` will come from this `BytesIO` object rather than the original input source.

The variables `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this code snippet. They retain their initial values and conditions as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sys.stdin` is now a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data.**
