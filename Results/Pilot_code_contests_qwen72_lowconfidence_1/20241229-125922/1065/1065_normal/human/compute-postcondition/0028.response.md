The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. As a result, no further code execution occurs after this point. The state of the program remains unchanged except that the program is terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `sys.stdin` is a `BytesIO` object containing the original input data, `input` is a function that reads a line from `sys.stdin` and strips the newline and carriage return characters, `arr` is a list of integers with length \(n\) and each element in `arr` is equal to the corresponding element in `a`, `h` is the maximum value in `arr`, `el` is the next element in `arr`, `arr` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time, `res` may have been updated based on the condition inside the loop, 'NO' has been printed, and the program has been terminated.**
