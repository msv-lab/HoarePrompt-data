The code snippet `print('NO' if res[-1] < h else 'YES')` checks if the last element of `res` is less than `h`. Depending on this condition, it prints either 'NO' or 'YES'. 

Given the initial state:
- The loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed, or if the loop completes without exiting early, `res` will contain a non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`.
- The length of `res` is less than or equal to 1.
- The length of `res` is greater than 0.

We need to evaluate the condition `res[-1] < h`:
- Since the length of `res` is greater than 0, `res[-1]` refers to the last element of `res`.
- If `res[-1] < h`, 'NO' will be printed.
- If `res[-1] >= h`, 'YES' will be printed.

Since the initial state mentions that the loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, it implies that the condition `res[-1] < h` was met, leading to the printing of 'NO'.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **The loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed, the length of `res` is less than or equal to 1, and the length of `res` is greater than 0.**
