The code snippet `print('NO')` prints the string `'NO'` to the console. According to the initial state, if this line of code is executed, the program terminates immediately, and the final state is that `'NO'` has been printed. The initial state mentions that the current length of `res` is greater than 1, but since the program terminates after printing `'NO'`, the value of `res` and any other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **'NO' has been printed, the current length of `res` is greater than 1.**
