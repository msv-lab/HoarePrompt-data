Postcondition: ***The loop exits early due to the 'NO' condition, the program terminates and the final state is that 'NO' has been printed, or if the loop completes without exiting early, `res` will contain a non-decreasing subsequence of elements from `arr`. Additionally, the length of `res` is less than or equal to 1.***
