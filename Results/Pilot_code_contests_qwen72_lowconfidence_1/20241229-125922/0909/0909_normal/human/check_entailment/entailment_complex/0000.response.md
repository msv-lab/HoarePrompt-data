Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the special gap is exactly equal to `k`. According to the problem description, the special gap (where the element `mx` appears without a matching element in `b`) should be at least `k` for the transformation to be possible. However, the code only checks if the special gap is less than `k` and prints `-1` if true, but it does not handle the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2
5 2 3
3 1 4 5 2
3 5
```
In this case, the special gap is exactly 2 (which is equal to `k`). The current code will not correctly handle this case and may produce an incorrect result.

To fix this, the condition in the code should be changed to check if the special gap is less than or equal to `k`:
```python
if (specialgap <= k) :
    print(-1)
    return
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.
