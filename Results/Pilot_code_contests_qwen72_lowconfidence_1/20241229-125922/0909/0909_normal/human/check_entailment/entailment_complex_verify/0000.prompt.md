You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.

You have two types of spells which you may cast: 

  1. Fireball: you spend x mana and destroy exactly k consecutive warriors; 
  2. Berserk: you spend y mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. 



For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].

You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of sequence a and the length of sequence b respectively.

The second line contains three integers x, k, y (1 ≤ x, y, ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers a_i are pairwise distinct.

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers b_i are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, or -1 if it is impossible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input sequences `a` and `b` have the same elements but in different orders. For example, if `a = [1, 3, 2, 4]` and `b = [1, 4, 3, 2]`, the program will output `-1` because it checks if the sets of `a` and `b` are equal (`sa == sb`). However, this check is not sufficient since the order of elements matters, and the transformation might still be possible using the given spells. Therefore, the program incorrectly determines that the transformation is impossible in this case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes two lists `a` and `b` to determine the minimum cost required to transform the sequence `a` into the sequence `b` using two operations: casting a fireball (with cost `x`) and casting berserk (with cost `y`). The function assumes that the lengths of `a` and `b` are provided as `n` and `m` respectively, and that `a` and `b` contain distinct integers within the range [1, n]. The function also uses the parameters `x`, `k`, and `y` which represent the costs and the range of the fireball operation. 

1. The function first checks if the sequence `a` contains all the elements of `b` in the same order. If not, it prints `-1` and returns.
2. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are identical, it prints `0` and returns.
3. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are not identical, it finds the maximum element in `a` that is not in `b` (`mx`).
4. The function then calculates the gaps between consecutive matching elements in `a` and `b`, and keeps track of a special gap where the element `mx` appears without a matching element in `b`.
5. If the special gap is less than `k`, it prints `-1` and returns.
6. Finally, it calculates the total cost to fill the gaps:
   - If the cost of a single fireball (`x`) is less than the cost of `k` berserks (`y * k`), it uses a combination of fireballs and berserks to minimize the cost.
   - Otherwise, it uses only berserks to fill the gaps.
7. The function prints the total cost and does not return any value.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are provided and that `func_2` correctly returns the necessary parameters. If `func_2` fails or returns invalid data, the function may not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are empty or where `n` or `m` are zero.
- The function does not validate the inputs to ensure they meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, etc.). If these constraints are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or fail.
- The function does not handle cases where the special gap is exactly equal to `k`. It only checks if the special gap is less than `k` and prints `-1` if true, but it should also handle the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string, where each integer is separated by spaces in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is an integer offset to be added to each element read from the input.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each. The function assumes that the input is a string of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-numeric input values.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The values in the list depend on the implementation of `func_2()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `m`. It returns a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The values in the list depend on the implementation of `func_2()`. The parameter `m` is not used within the function and has no effect on the output. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable object (function), and *dim is a sequence of positive integers representing dimensions.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_5(f, *dim[1:])`, or it returns the result of calling `f()` if `dim` is an empty sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a callable object `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `*dim`, and each innermost list contains the result of calling `f()`. If `*dim` is an empty sequence, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either a nested list of results from `f()` or a single result from `f()`, depending on the length of `*dim`. Edge cases include when `*dim` is an empty sequence, in which case the function simply returns the result of `f()`, and when `*dim` contains only one element, in which case the function returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each being the result of `f()`.
