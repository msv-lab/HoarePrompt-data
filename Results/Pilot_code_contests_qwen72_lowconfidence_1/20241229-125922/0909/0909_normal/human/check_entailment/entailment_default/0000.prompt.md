You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.

You have two types of spells which you may cast: 

  1. Fireball: you spend x mana and destroy exactly k consecutive warriors; 
  2. Berserk: you spend y mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. 



For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].

You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of sequence a and the length of sequence b respectively.

The second line contains three integers x, k, y (1 ≤ x, y, ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers a_i are pairwise distinct.

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers b_i are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, or -1 if it is impossible.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` processes two lists `a` and `b` to determine the minimum cost required to transform the sequence `a` into the sequence `b` using two operations: casting a fireball (with cost `x`) and casting berserk (with cost `y`). The function assumes that the lengths of `a` and `b` are provided as `n` and `m` respectively, and that `a` and `b` contain distinct integers within the range [1, n]. The function also uses the parameters `x`, `k`, and `y` which represent the costs and the range of the fireball operation. 

1. The function first checks if the sequence `a` contains all the elements of `b` in the same order. If not, it prints `-1` and returns.
2. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are identical, it prints `0` and returns.
3. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are not identical, it finds the maximum element in `a` that is not in `b` (`mx`).
4. The function then calculates the gaps between consecutive matching elements in `a` and `b`, and keeps track of a special gap where the element `mx` appears without a matching element in `b`.
5. If the special gap is less than `k`, it prints `-1` and returns.
6. Finally, it calculates the total cost to fill the gaps:
   - If the cost of a single fireball (`x`) is less than the cost of `k` berserks (`y * k`), it uses a combination of fireballs and berserks to minimize the cost.
   - Otherwise, it uses only berserks to fill the gaps.
7. The function prints the total cost and does not return any value.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are provided and that `func_2` correctly returns the necessary parameters. If `func_2` fails or returns invalid data, the function may not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are empty or where `n` or `m` are zero.
- The function does not validate the inputs to ensure they meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, etc.). If these constraints are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or fail.
- The function does not handle cases where the special gap is exactly equal to `k`. It only checks if the special gap is less than `k` and prints `-1` if true, but it should also handle the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(o):
    return [int(x) + o for x in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each. The function assumes that the input is a string of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-numeric input values.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `m`. It returns a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The values in the list depend on the implementation of `func_2()`. The parameter `m` is not used within the function and has no effect on the output. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(f, *dim):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a callable object `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `*dim`, and each innermost list contains the result of calling `f()`. If `*dim` is an empty sequence, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either a nested list of results from `f()` or a single result from `f()`, depending on the length of `*dim`. Edge cases include when `*dim` is an empty sequence, in which case the function simply returns the result of `f()`, and when `*dim` contains only one element, in which case the function returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each being the result of `f()`.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
