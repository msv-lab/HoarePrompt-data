You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.

You have two types of spells which you may cast: 

  1. Fireball: you spend x mana and destroy exactly k consecutive warriors; 
  2. Berserk: you spend y mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. 



For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].

You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of sequence a and the length of sequence b respectively.

The second line contains three integers x, k, y (1 ≤ x, y, ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers a_i are pairwise distinct.

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers b_i are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, or -1 if it is impossible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling of Special Gaps**: The program attempts to handle the "special gap" where the maximum value in `sa - sb` is found. However, it incorrectly assumes that this special gap will always be at least `k` long. This is not necessarily true, and the program does not properly handle cases where the special gap is less than `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Mana Cost**: The program calculates the mana cost for gaps using the following logic:
   ```python
   if x < y * k:
       for g in gaps:
           ans += x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)
   else:
       for g in gaps:
           ans += y * g
   ```
   This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of using a combination of Fireball and Berserk spells to minimize the total mana cost. For example, if a gap is just slightly larger than `k`, it might be more efficient to use a Fireball spell followed by a few Berserk spells rather than just using Berserk spells alone.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the input sequences `a` and `b` are such that it is impossible to transform `a` into `b` using the given spells, the program does not always detect this and might output an incorrect result.

4. **Special Gap Calculation**: The program calculates the special gap incorrectly. It assumes that the special gap is always the last gap where the maximum value in `sa - sb` is found, which is not always the case. The special gap should be the first gap that contains the maximum value in `sa - sb`.

To fix these issues, the program would need to be significantly revised to ensure that it correctly handles all edge cases and calculates the minimum mana cost accurately.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
