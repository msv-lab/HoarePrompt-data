You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.

You have two types of spells which you may cast: 

  1. Fireball: you spend x mana and destroy exactly k consecutive warriors; 
  2. Berserk: you spend y mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. 



For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].

You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of sequence a and the length of sequence b respectively.

The second line contains three integers x, k, y (1 ≤ x, y, ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers a_i are pairwise distinct.

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers b_i are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, or -1 if it is impossible.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input sequences `a` and `b` have the same elements but in different orders. For example, if `a = [1, 3, 2, 4]` and `b = [1, 4, 3, 2]`, the program will output `-1` because it checks if the sets of `a` and `b` are equal (`sa == sb`). However, this check is not sufficient since the order of elements matters, and the transformation might still be possible using the given spells. Therefore, the program incorrectly determines that the transformation is impossible in this case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 5 : The function `func_5` accepts a callable object `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `*dim`, and each innermost list contains the result of calling `f()`. If `*dim` is an empty sequence, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either a nested list of results from `f()` or a single result from `f()`, depending on the length of `*dim`. Edge cases include when `*dim` is an empty sequence, in which case the function simply returns the result of `f()`, and when `*dim` contains only one element, in which case the function returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each being the result of `f()`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
