Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not handle a specific edge case correctly: when the special gap is exactly equal to `k`. According to the problem description, the special gap should be able to be destroyed using a fireball if it is at least `k` in length. However, the current implementation only checks if the special gap is less than `k` and prints `-1` if true. It does not handle the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2
5 2 3
3 1 4 5 2
3 5
```
In this case, the special gap is exactly 2 (which is equal to `k`), and the function should be able to use a fireball to destroy this gap. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print `-1` because it only checks if the special gap is less than `k`.

To fix this, the condition should be changed to check if the special gap is less than `k` or equal to `k`:
```python
if specialgap < k:
    print(-1)
    return
```

This change ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the special gap is exactly `k` in length. Without this change, the function is incorrect for this specific edge case.
