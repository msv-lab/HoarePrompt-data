You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are n warriors in a row. The power of the i-th warrior is a_i. All powers are pairwise distinct.

You have two types of spells which you may cast: 

  1. Fireball: you spend x mana and destroy exactly k consecutive warriors; 
  2. Berserk: you spend y mana, choose two consecutive warriors, and the warrior with greater power destroys the warrior with smaller power. 



For example, let the powers of warriors be [2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 5, 4], and k = 3. If you cast Berserk on warriors with powers 8 and 11, the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 7, 11, 5, 4]. Then, for example, if you cast Fireball on consecutive warriors with powers [7, 11, 5], the resulting sequence of powers becomes [2, 3, 4].

You want to turn the current sequence of warriors powers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. Calculate the minimum amount of mana you need to spend on it.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of sequence a and the length of sequence b respectively.

The second line contains three integers x, k, y (1 ≤ x, y, ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the cost of fireball, the range of fireball and the cost of berserk respectively.

The third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers a_i are pairwise distinct.

The fourth line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n). It is guaranteed that all integers b_i are pairwise distinct.

Output

Print the minimum amount of mana for turning the sequnce a_1, a_2, ..., a_n into b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, or -1 if it is impossible.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
