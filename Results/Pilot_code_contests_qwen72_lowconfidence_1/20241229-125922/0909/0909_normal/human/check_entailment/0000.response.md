Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input sequences `a` and `b` have the same elements but in different orders. For example, if `a = [1, 3, 2, 4]` and `b = [1, 4, 3, 2]`, the program will output `-1` because it checks if the sets of `a` and `b` are equal (`sa == sb`). However, this check is not sufficient since the order of elements matters, and the transformation might still be possible using the given spells. Therefore, the program incorrectly determines that the transformation is impossible in this case.
