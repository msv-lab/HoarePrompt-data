The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each. The function assumes that the input is a string of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-numeric input values.
