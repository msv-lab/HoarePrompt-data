n and m are positive integers representing the lengths of sequences a and b respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. x, k, y are positive integers representing the cost of casting a fireball, the range of the fireball, and the cost of casting berserk respectively, with 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers representing the powers of the warriors, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and all a_i are pairwise distinct. b is a list of m integers representing the target sequence of powers, where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n and all b_i are pairwise distinct.
