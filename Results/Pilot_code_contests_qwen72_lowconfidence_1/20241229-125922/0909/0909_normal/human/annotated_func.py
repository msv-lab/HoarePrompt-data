#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes two lists `a` and `b` to determine the minimum cost required to transform the sequence `a` into the sequence `b` using two operations: casting a fireball (with cost `x`) and casting berserk (with cost `y`). The function assumes that the lengths of `a` and `b` are provided as `n` and `m` respectively, and that `a` and `b` contain distinct integers within the range [1, n]. The function also uses the parameters `x`, `k`, and `y` which represent the costs and the range of the fireball operation. 

1. The function first checks if the sequence `a` contains all the elements of `b` in the same order. If not, it prints `-1` and returns.
2. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are identical, it prints `0` and returns.
3. If the sets of elements in `a` and `b` are not identical, it finds the maximum element in `a` that is not in `b` (`mx`).
4. The function then calculates the gaps between consecutive matching elements in `a` and `b`, and keeps track of a special gap where the element `mx` appears without a matching element in `b`.
5. If the special gap is less than `k`, it prints `-1` and returns.
6. Finally, it calculates the total cost to fill the gaps:
   - If the cost of a single fireball (`x`) is less than the cost of `k` berserks (`y * k`), it uses a combination of fireballs and berserks to minimize the cost.
   - Otherwise, it uses only berserks to fill the gaps.
7. The function prints the total cost and does not return any value.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `a` and `b` are provided and that `func_2` correctly returns the necessary parameters. If `func_2` fails or returns invalid data, the function may not behave as expected.
- The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` are empty or where `n` or `m` are zero.
- The function does not validate the inputs to ensure they meet the specified constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`, etc.). If these constraints are not met, the function may produce incorrect results or fail.
- The function does not handle cases where the special gap is exactly equal to `k`. It only checks if the special gap is less than `k` and prints `-1` if true, but it should also handle the case where the special gap is exactly `k`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the input string, where each integer is separated by spaces in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty, an empty list is returned. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: o is an integer offset to be added to each element read from the input.
def func_3(o):
    return [(int(x) + o) for x in input().split()]
    #The program returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts an integer `o` and returns a list where each element is an integer from the input split by spaces, with the integer offset `o` added to each. The function assumes that the input is a string of space-separated integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input or non-numeric input values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers.
def func_4(n, m):
    return [func_2() for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The values in the list depend on the implementation of `func_2()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `n` and `m`. It returns a list of length `n` where each element is the result of calling `func_2()`. The values in the list depend on the implementation of `func_2()`. The parameter `m` is not used within the function and has no effect on the output. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable object (function), and *dim is a sequence of positive integers representing dimensions.
def func_5(f):
    return [func_5(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_5(f, *dim[1:])`, or it returns the result of calling `f()` if `dim` is an empty sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a callable object `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `*dim`, and each innermost list contains the result of calling `f()`. If `*dim` is an empty sequence, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either a nested list of results from `f()` or a single result from `f()`, depending on the length of `*dim`. Edge cases include when `*dim` is an empty sequence, in which case the function simply returns the result of `f()`, and when `*dim` contains only one element, in which case the function returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each being the result of `f()`.
