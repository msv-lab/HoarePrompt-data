The code snippet `gl = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `gl`. Since `gl` was already 0 in the initial state, there is no change to its value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, `j` is 1, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing `[0]`, `gl` is 0, `special` is `False`, `j` is less than `m`, `ax` is equal to `b[j-1]`. If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is 0.**
