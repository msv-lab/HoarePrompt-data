The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function is intended to operate with implicit parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b` that are not explicitly listed in the function signature. These parameters are:

- `n` and `m`: Positive integers representing the lengths of sequences `a` and `b` respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `x`, `k`, `y`: Positive integers representing the cost of casting a fireball, the range of the fireball, and the cost of casting berserk, with 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers representing the powers of the warriors, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and all a_i are pairwise distinct.
- `b`: A list of `m` integers representing the target sequence of powers, where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n and all b_i are pairwise distinct.

The function does not return any value in any of the cases described (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3). It either returns `None` or does not return any value at all.

Functionality: **The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates on implicit parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. It does not return any value in any case.**
