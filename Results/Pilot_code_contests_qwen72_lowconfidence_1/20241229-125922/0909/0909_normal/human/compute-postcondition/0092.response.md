To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues. The loop iterates over the `gaps` list, and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `gaps`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ax` is the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now includes `gl`.
- `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`).
- `gaps` must have at least two elements.
- If `special` is `True`, meaning the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`.
- `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is `y * g` + `y * g`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.
- `g` is the next element in the `gaps` list.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `gaps` must have at least one more element after the current `g`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `g` is the next element in `gaps`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `ax`, `j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
