The given code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding the product of `y` and `g` to its current value. Here's the detailed impact of the code on the program:

- `ans` is updated by adding `y * g` to its current value. Given that `ans` was initially set to `y * g + y * g`, the new value of `ans` becomes `y * g + y * g + y * g`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `ax`, `j`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now includes `gl`, `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`), `gaps` must have at least two elements, if `special` is `True`, meaning the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `y * g + y * g + y * g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is the next element in the `gaps` list.**
