The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` using the formula `ans += x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.

- `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.
- `g` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a variable available in the context where this code is executed. For the purpose of this task, we assume `g` is a positive integer.
- `x`, `k`, and `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `x` is less than `y * k`.

Given these points, the new value of `ans` is calculated as follows:

1. Compute `g // k` which gives the quotient when `g` is divided by `k`.
2. Compute `g % k` which gives the remainder when `g` is divided by `k`.
3. Multiply `x` by the quotient and `y` by the remainder.
4. Add these two products to the current value of `ans`.

The output state will include the updated value of `ans` and all other conditions and values from the initial state that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now has one fewer element, `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`), `special` is `True` if the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, `specialgap` is set to `gl` and is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `ans + x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`, `x` is less than `y * k`, `gaps` must have at least one element.**
