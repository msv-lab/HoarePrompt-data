The provided Python code snippet contains only a print statement that outputs `-1`. This operation does not modify any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is the number of elements in `a` that match the corresponding elements in `b` up to the minimum of `len(a)` and `m`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`. `j` is less than `m`. The value `-1` has been printed.**
