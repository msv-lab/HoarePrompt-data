The function `func_5` accepts two parameters: `f`, which is a callable object (function), and `*dim`, which is a sequence of positive integers representing dimensions. If `dim` is an empty sequence, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is not empty, the function returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each of which is the result of calling `func_5(f, *dim[1:])`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a callable object `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. If `dim` is an empty sequence, it returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a list of `dim[0]` elements, each being the result of calling `func_5(f, *dim[1:])`.**
