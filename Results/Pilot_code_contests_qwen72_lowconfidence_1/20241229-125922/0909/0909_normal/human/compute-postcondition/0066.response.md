The code snippet `gl += 1` increments the value of `gl` by 1. The initial value of `gl` is 0, 1, or 2. After incrementing, the new value of `gl` will be 1, 2, or 3, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element of `a`, `j` is 0, 1, or 2, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`, `gl` is 1, 2, or 3. If `ax == mx`, `special` is `True` and `specialgap` is 0. Otherwise, `special` remains `False` and `specialgap` is undefined.**
