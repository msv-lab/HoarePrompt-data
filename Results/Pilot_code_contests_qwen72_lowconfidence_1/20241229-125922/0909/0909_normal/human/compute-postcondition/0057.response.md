To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will continue to iterate. The loop is defined as:

```python
for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that for each iteration, `i` and `ax` are updated to the next index and value in the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `ax` is the second element of `a`.
- `j` is 0, 1, or 2.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`.
- `gl` is 0, 1, or 2.
- If `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, `special` is `False` and `j` is 1 or 2.
- Otherwise, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is `True` and `specialgap` is 0.
- If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is 0. Otherwise, `special` remains `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. **Index `i`**: Since `i` is the current index, it should be incremented by 1.
2. **Value `ax`**: `ax` should be set to the next element in the list `a`.

Let's update the state accordingly:

- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `ax` is set to the third element of `a`.

The rest of the state remains unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop iteration itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element of `a`, `j` is 0, 1, or 2, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`, `gl` is 0, 1, or 2. If `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, `special` is `False` and `j` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, if `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is `True` and `specialgap` is 0. If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is 0. Otherwise, `special` remains `False`.**
