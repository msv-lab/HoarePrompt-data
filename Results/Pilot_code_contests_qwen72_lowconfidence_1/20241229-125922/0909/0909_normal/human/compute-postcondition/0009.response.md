To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

1. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers.
   - `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
   - `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least one element.
   - `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ax` is the first element of `a`.
   - If `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1, and `ax` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `b[0]`. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `ax` at each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least one more element beyond the current index `i`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will increment `i` to 1.
   - The value of `ax` will be updated to the second element of `a` (since `enumerate` will move to the next element).
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b`, `j`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but we are not considering the loop body here.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `ax` is now the second element of `a`.
   - The list `a` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least two elements, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. If `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1, and `ax` (the second element of `a`) is equal to `b[0]`. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged.**
