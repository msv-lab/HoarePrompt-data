Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`, `j` is 1 or 2, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`, `gl` is 0 or 1, `special` is `False` unless `ax` equals `mx` and `j` is 0, in which case `special` is `True`. If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is `gl`. Otherwise, `specialgap` remains undefined.***
