The code `sb = set(b)` creates a set `sb` from the list `b`. This means `sb` will contain all the unique elements from `b`, which are already guaranteed to be pairwise distinct and within the range 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the only new variable introduced is `sb`, and its value is a set of unique elements from `b`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is the number of elements in `a` that match the corresponding elements in `b` up to the minimum of `len(a)` and `m`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is equal to `m`, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.**
