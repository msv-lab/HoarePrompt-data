The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, `j` is 0, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 1. If `ax` equals `mx`, then `special` is `True`. Additionally, either `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`.**
