Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now includes `gl`, `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`). If `special` is `True`, meaning the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`. The `gaps` list has been printed. Additionally, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 0, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.**
