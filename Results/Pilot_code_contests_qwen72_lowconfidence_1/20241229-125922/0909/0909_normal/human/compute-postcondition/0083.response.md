The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` to its current value. Here, `g` is assumed to be an element of the list `gaps`.

### Impact Analysis:
- **`ans`**: This variable's value is updated by adding the calculated expression to its current value.
- **Expression Calculation**:
  - `g // k`: Integer division of `g` by `k`.
  - `g % k`: Remainder of `g` divided by `k`.
  - `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`: This is the value added to `ans`.

### Precondition Summary:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ax` is the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now has one less element.
- `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`).
- `special` is `True` if the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`.
- `specialgap` is set to `gl` and is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for all `g` in `gaps`, and `x` is less than `y * k`.
- `gaps` must have at least one element.

### Updated State:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`.

### Output State:
