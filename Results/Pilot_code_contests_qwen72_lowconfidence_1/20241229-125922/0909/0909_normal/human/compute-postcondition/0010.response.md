The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The values of `i`, `ax`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least two elements, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`.**
