The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`. The current value of `j` is 1, and `ax` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `b[0]`.**
