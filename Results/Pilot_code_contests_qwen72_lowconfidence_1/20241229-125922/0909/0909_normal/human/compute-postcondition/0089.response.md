The provided code snippet `ans += y * g` updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `y` and `g`. However, the variable `g` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Given this, we can only describe the change in `ans` in terms of `y` and `g`.

- `ans` is initially 0.
- After executing `ans += y * g`, `ans` becomes `y * g`.

All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now includes `gl`, `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`), `gaps` must have at least one element, if `special` is `True`, meaning the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`, `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `y * g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`**.
