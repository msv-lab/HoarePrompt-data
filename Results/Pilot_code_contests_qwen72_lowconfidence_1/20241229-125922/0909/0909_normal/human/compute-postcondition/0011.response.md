Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least two elements, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`. If `j < m` and `ax == b[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1, and `ax` remains the second element of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged.***
