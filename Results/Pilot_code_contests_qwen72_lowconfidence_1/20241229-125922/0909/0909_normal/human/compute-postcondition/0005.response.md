To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the `for` loop to run:

1. The `enumerate(a)` function will generate pairs of indices and values from the list `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, and each element `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `j` is 0.

We need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b`, and `j`) do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given loop statement.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `a` must have at least one element.
- The index `i` will start at 0.
- The value `ax` will be the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 0, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`**
