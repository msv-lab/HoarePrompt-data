To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will continue. The loop iterates over the elements of the `gaps` list, so the key condition is that `gaps` must have at least one element left.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ax` is the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now has one less element.
- `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`).
- `special` is `True` if the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`.
- `specialgap` is set to `gl` and is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is `ans + x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`, and `x` is less than `y * k`.
- `gaps` must have at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for g in gaps:` will execute as long as `gaps` has at least one element.

2. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop has already executed once, the first element of `gaps` has been processed and removed from the list.
   - Therefore, the new state should reflect that `gaps` now has one fewer element.

### Adjusted State:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ax` is the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now has one fewer element.
- `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`).
- `special` is `True` if the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`.
- `specialgap` is set to `gl` and is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is `ans + x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`, and `x` is less than `y * k`.
- `gaps` must have at least one element.
