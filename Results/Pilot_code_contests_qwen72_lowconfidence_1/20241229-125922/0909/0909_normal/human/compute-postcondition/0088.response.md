To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will iterate. Specifically, the loop will execute if the `gaps` list contains at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ax` is the last element of `a`.
- `j` is the number of elements in `b` that match elements in `a` in order.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between matching elements in `a` and `b` and now includes `gl`.
- `gl` is the length of the final gap (or 0 if the last element of `a` matches an element in `b`).
- If `special` is `True`, meaning the last element of `a` is `mx` and no matching element was found in `b`, then `specialgap` is set to `gl`.
- The `gaps` list has been printed.
- `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`.

For the loop to execute, the `gaps` list must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `gaps` is not empty.
