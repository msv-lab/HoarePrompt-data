`mx` is assigned the value of the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`. Since `sa` and `sb` are sets containing unique elements from `a` and `b` respectively, and `sa` is not equal to `sb`, there is at least one element in `sa` that is not in `sb`. The value of `mx` is therefore the largest such element. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is the number of elements in `a` that match the corresponding elements in `b` up to the minimum of `len(a)` and `m`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ax` is the last element of `a`, `j` is equal to `m`, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.**
