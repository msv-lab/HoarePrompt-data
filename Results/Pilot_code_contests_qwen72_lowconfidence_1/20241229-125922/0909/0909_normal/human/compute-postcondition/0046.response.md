To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, and each element `b_i` satisfies \(1 \leq b_i \leq n\).
- `i` is 0.
- `ax` is the first element of `a`.
- `j` is 0 or 1.
- `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`.
- `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`.
- `sa` is not equal to `sb`.
- `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`.
- `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`.
- `gl` is 0 or 1.
- `special` is `False` unless `ax` equals `mx` and `j` is 0, in which case `special` is `True`.
- If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `a` to iterate over.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ax` is the first element of `a`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Index `i`**: The index `i` will be incremented by 1.
- **Element `ax`**: The variable `ax` will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 1.
- `ax` is the second element of `a`.

### Other States:
- The other states (`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `specialgap`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of `a`, `j` is 0 or 1, `sa` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `sb` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `sa` is not equal to `sb`, `mx` is the maximum element in the set difference between `sa` and `sb`, `gaps` is an empty list or a list containing `[0]`, `gl` is 0 or 1, `special` is `False` unless `ax` equals `mx` and `j` is 0, in which case `special` is `True`. If `special` is `True`, `specialgap` is 0.**
