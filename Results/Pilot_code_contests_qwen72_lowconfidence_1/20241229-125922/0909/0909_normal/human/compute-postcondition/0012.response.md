To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure.

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least two elements.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, and each element satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`.
- `j` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `ax` is the second element of `a`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (i, ax) in enumerate(a):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a` using `enumerate(a)`, which provides both the index `i` and the value `ax` of each element in `a`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ax` is the second element of `a`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `a` has at least two elements.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `a`.
- Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration will set `i` to 2.
- The value of `ax` will be the third element of `a` (if it exists).

### Updated State:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `ax` will be the third element of `a`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must have at least three elements. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()` and must have at least three elements, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`, `j` is 0, `i` is 2, `ax` is the third element of `a`.**
