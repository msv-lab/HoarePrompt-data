The value of `b` is updated to the list of integers returned by the function `func_2()`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `func_2()` returns a list of integers, and given that `b` was initially a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct and within the range 1 to `n`, after the assignment, `b` now holds the new list returned by `func_2()`, which also adheres to the same properties.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `x`, `k`, `y` are positive integers returned by `func_2()`, `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `b` is a list of `m` integers with all elements being pairwise distinct, 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ `n`**
