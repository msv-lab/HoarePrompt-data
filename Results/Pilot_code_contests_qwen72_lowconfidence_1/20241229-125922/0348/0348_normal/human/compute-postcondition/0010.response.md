To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `a` is at least 1.
- `m` is at least 20.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `mod` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{mod} \leq 10^7\).
- `i` is 2.
- The program has terminated if \((m - i \times 10^9 \mod m) \mod m\) is greater than `b`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(1, min(a + 1, m + 1)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `min(a + 1, m + 1) - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `min(a + 1, m + 1) - 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
- The loop will continue if `i` (which is now 3) is less than `min(a + 1, m + 1)`.

Given that `a` is at least 1 and `m` is at least 20, `min(a + 1, m + 1)` will be at least 2 (since `a + 1` is at least 2). Therefore, `i` being 3 will still be within the range as long as `a` is at least 2 or `m` is at least 3.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 20, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 3. If \((m - i \times 10^9 \% m) \% m\) is greater than `b`, the program has terminated.**
