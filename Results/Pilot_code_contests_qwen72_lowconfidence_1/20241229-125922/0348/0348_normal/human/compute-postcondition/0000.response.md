The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `mod` initially are integers within specified ranges. After executing the code, the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated with the input values, while `mod` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7.**
