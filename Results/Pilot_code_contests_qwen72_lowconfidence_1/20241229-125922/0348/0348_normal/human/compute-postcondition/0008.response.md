The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. No further changes occur to any variables, but the program does not continue executing any subsequent lines of code.

Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 20, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 2, and the program has terminated.**
