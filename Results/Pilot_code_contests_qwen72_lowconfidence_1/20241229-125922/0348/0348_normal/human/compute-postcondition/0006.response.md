To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `a` is at least 1.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `mod` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{mod} \leq 10^7\).
- `i` is 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is \( (m - i * 10) \geq 0 \).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, min(a + 1, m + 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range \(1\) to \( \min(a + 1, m + 1) \).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be 2 for the next iteration.
- The condition \( (m - i * 10) \geq 0 \) must still hold true for the loop to continue. This means \( m - 2 * 10 \geq 0 \), or \( m \geq 20 \).

### Final State:
- `a` remains at least 1.
- `m` must be at least 20 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `b` remains an input integer.
- `mod` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{mod} \leq 10^7\).
- `i` is 2.

State: **`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 20, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 2**
