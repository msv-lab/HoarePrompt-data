Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 20, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 3. If \((m - i \times 10^9 \% m) \% m\) is greater than `b`, the program prints "1 000000003" and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues without printing anything.***
