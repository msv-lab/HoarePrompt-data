The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program execution immediately. As a result, no further changes to the variables occur after this point. The values of the variables remain as they were before the `sys.exit()` call.

Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 1, and the value of `(m - i * 10)` remains unchanged. The program has been terminated.**
