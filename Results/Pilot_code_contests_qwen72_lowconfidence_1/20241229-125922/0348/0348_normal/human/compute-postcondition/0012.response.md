The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program execution immediately. This means no further lines of code will be executed after this point. Since the condition for this line to execute is that \((m - i \times 10^9 \% m) \% m\) is greater than `b`, the program has already checked this condition and determined it to be true, leading to the termination of the program.

Therefore, the output state includes all the conditions from the initial state that are still valid, with the addition that the program has terminated.

Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `m` is at least 20, `b` is an input integer, `mod` is an integer such that 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^7, `i` is 3, the program has printed "1 000000003", \((m - i \times 10^9 \% m) \% m\) is greater than `b`, and the program has terminated.**
