You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In a very ancient country the following game was popular. Two people play the game. Initially first player writes a string s1, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceed a. After that second player looks at s1 and writes a string s2, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceed b. Here a and b are some given constants, s1 and s2 are chosen by the players. The strings are allowed to contain leading zeroes.

If a number obtained by the concatenation (joining together) of strings s1 and s2 is divisible by mod, then the second player wins. Otherwise the first player wins. You are given numbers a, b, mod. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play in the optimal manner. If the first player wins, you are also required to find the lexicographically minimum winning move.

Input

The first line contains three integers a, b, mod (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 109, 1 ≤ mod ≤ 107).

Output

If the first player wins, print "1" and the lexicographically minimum string s1 he has to write to win. If the second player wins, print the single number "2".

Examples

Input

1 10 7


Output

2


Input

4 0 9


Output

1 000000001

Note

The lexical comparison of strings is performed by the < operator in modern programming languages. String x is lexicographically less than string y if exists such i (1 ≤ i ≤ 9), that xi < yi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) xj = yj. These strings always have length 9.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(1, min(a + 1, m + 1)):
        if (m - i * 10 ** 9 % m) % m > b:
            print(1, '%(x)09d' % {'x': i})
            sys.exit()
    print(2)


```
Output hints: The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the standard input. It then iterates over a range from 1 to the minimum of `a + 1` and `m + 1`. For each value `i` in this range, it checks if `(m - i * 10

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
