Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided is intended to solve the described problem, but there are several issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**:
   - The function uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment, which is more commonly used today.

2. **String Formatting**:
   - The string formatting `'%(x)09d' % {'x': i}` is outdated and could be replaced with a more modern approach like `f'{i:09d}'` in Python 3. However, this is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.

3. **Logic in the Loop**:
   - The condition inside the loop is:
     ```python
     if (m - i * 10 ** 9 % m) % m > b:
     ```
     This condition is intended to check if the second player can force a win by ensuring that the concatenated number is not divisible by `mod`. However, the condition is not correctly formulated. The correct condition should be:
     ```python
     if (i * 10 ** 9 + j) % m > b for j in range(b + 1):
     ```
     This ensures that no matter what `s2` the second player chooses (within the limit `b`), the concatenated number will not be divisible by `mod`.

4. **Early Exit**:
   - The program exits early using `sys.exit()` if it finds a winning move for the first player. While this is efficient, it is not necessary to use `sys.exit()`. Instead, returning from the function would be more appropriate.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, but the logic to determine the winner and the lexicographically minimum move for the first player is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all cases where the first player can win.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1 10 7
```
- The program should output `2` because the second player can always choose a number such that the concatenated number is divisible by 7.
- However, the program might incorrectly output `1 000000001` if the logic inside the loop is not correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner and the lexicographically minimum move for the first player. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and thus it is incorrect.
