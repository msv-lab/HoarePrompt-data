Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The use of `raw_input()` is incorrect in Python 3. It should be `input()`. This is a critical issue as it will cause a runtime error in Python 3.

2. **String Formatting**: The string formatting method used (`'%(x)09d' % {'x': i}`) is outdated and can be simplified using f-strings or the `str.format()` method. However, this is more of a stylistic issue and does not affect the correctness of the logic.

3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The program correctly checks if there exists a value `i` such that the concatenated number `s1s2` is not divisible by `mod` and `i` is within the allowed range.
   - However, the condition `(m - i * 10 ** 9 % m) % m > b` is not entirely clear and might not correctly reflect the intended logic. Specifically, the expression `i * 10 ** 9 % m` is used, which might not correctly handle the modulo operation for large values of `i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `a` or `b` is 0. According to the problem description, `a` and `b` can be 0, and the program should still work correctly in these cases.
   - The program assumes that the first player will always win if there is a valid `i` within the range, but it does not explicitly check if `i` is within the range `[1, a]` and `b` is within the range `[0, b]`.

5. **Optimal Move**:
   - The program correctly prints the lexicographically minimum string `s1` if the first player wins, but it does not ensure that the string is exactly 9 digits long in all cases.

### Corrected Version of the Program

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues mentioned:

```python
import sys

def func():
    a, b, mod = map(int, input().split())
    
    for i in range(1, min(a + 1, mod + 1)):
        if (10**9 * i) % mod > b:
            print(1, f'{i:09d}')
            sys.exit()
    
    print(2)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function is used instead of `raw_input()` to ensure compatibility with Python 3.
2. **String Formatting**: The f-string `f'{i:09d}'` is used to format the number `i` as a 9-digit string with leading zeros.
3. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The condition `(10**9 * i) % mod > b` correctly checks if the concatenated number `s1s2` is not divisible by `mod` and `i` is within the allowed range.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where `a` or `b` is 0 by ensuring that `i` is within the range `[1, a]` and `b` is within the range `[0, b]`.

This corrected version should now meet the requirements of the problem description.
