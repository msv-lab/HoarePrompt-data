You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In a very ancient country the following game was popular. Two people play the game. Initially first player writes a string s1, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceed a. After that second player looks at s1 and writes a string s2, consisting of exactly nine digits and representing a number that does not exceed b. Here a and b are some given constants, s1 and s2 are chosen by the players. The strings are allowed to contain leading zeroes.

If a number obtained by the concatenation (joining together) of strings s1 and s2 is divisible by mod, then the second player wins. Otherwise the first player wins. You are given numbers a, b, mod. Your task is to determine who wins if both players play in the optimal manner. If the first player wins, you are also required to find the lexicographically minimum winning move.

Input

The first line contains three integers a, b, mod (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 109, 1 ≤ mod ≤ 107).

Output

If the first player wins, print "1" and the lexicographically minimum string s1 he has to write to win. If the second player wins, print the single number "2".

Examples

Input

1 10 7


Output

2


Input

4 0 9


Output

1 000000001

Note

The lexical comparison of strings is performed by the < operator in modern programming languages. String x is lexicographically less than string y if exists such i (1 ≤ i ≤ 9), that xi < yi, and for any j (1 ≤ j < i) xj = yj. These strings always have length 9.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in range(1, min(a + 1, m + 1)):
        if (m - i * 10 ** 9 % m) % m > b:
            print(1, '%(x)09d' % {'x': i})
            sys.exit()
    print(2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle the case where `a` is 0. According to the problem description, `a` and `b` can be as low as 0. If `a` is 0, the loop `for i in range(1, min(a + 1, m + 1))` will not execute because the range starts from 1, and thus the program will directly print "2" without considering the possibility that the first player might still have a winning move.

For example, consider the input:
```
0 0 7
```
In this case, the first player cannot make a move since `a` is 0, but the program will incorrectly output "2" without checking if the second player has a valid move either. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the standard input. It then iterates over a range from 1 to the minimum of `a + 1` and `m + 1`. For each value `i` in this range, it checks if `(m - i * 10

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
