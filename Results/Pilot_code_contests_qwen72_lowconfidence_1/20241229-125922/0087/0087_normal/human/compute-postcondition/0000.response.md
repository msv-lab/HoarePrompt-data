The code snippet `h, remain = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)` calculates the number of hours (`h`) and the remaining seconds (`remain`) from the total available time (7200 seconds) minus the seconds already used (`seconds`). The `divmod` function returns a tuple containing the quotient and the remainder when the first argument is divided by the second.

- `7200 - seconds` gives the remaining seconds out of the total 7200 seconds.
- `divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)` divides the remaining seconds by 3600 to get the hours (`h`) and the remaining seconds (`remain`).

Given that `seconds` is a non-negative integer and does not exceed 7200, the value of `h` will be the number of full hours in the remaining time, and `remain` will be the remaining seconds after removing the full hours.

Output State: **seconds is a non-negative integer representing the total seconds of the tape used, where the total input time does not exceed 7200 seconds (2 hours), `h` is `(7200 - seconds) // 3600`, `remain` is `(7200 - seconds) % 3600`**
