Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1` is called twice in the main loop, once with `seconds` and once with `seconds // 3`. However, the second call should be `func_1(seconds * 3)` to correctly calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode. The division by 3 is incorrect because it reduces the time, whereas it should be multiplied to account for the increased recording capacity.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the remaining time by subtracting `seconds` from 7200 (the total time in seconds for a 120-minute tape). This is correct for standard recording mode. However, for triple recording mode, the total time should be 21600 seconds (3 * 7200), not 7200. Therefore, the calculation for triple recording mode should be `divmod(21600 - seconds, 3600)` instead of `divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)`.

3. **Output Format**: The program correctly formats the output as `HH:MM:SS` using `print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))`, which matches the problem description.

To correct these issues, the program should be modified as follows:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(7200 - seconds)
    func_1(21600 - seconds)

def func_1(remaining_seconds):
    h, remain = divmod(remaining_seconds, 3600)
    m, s = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))
```

With these changes, the program will correctly calculate and output the remaining tape time in both standard and triple recording modes.
