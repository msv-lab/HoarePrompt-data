Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is called twice, but the second call uses `seconds // 3`, which calculates the time for triple recording mode incorrectly. It should calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode by dividing the total remaining time by 3, not the elapsed time.

2. The program does not handle the case where the input time exceeds 120 minutes. According to the problem description, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). If the input exceeds this limit, the program should not proceed with the calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func_1(total_seconds, factor=1):
    seconds = total_seconds * factor
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    if seconds > 7200:
        continue  # Skip invalid inputs
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds, 3)
```

This version correctly handles the calculation for both standard and triple recording modes and skips invalid inputs where the elapsed time exceeds 120 minutes.
