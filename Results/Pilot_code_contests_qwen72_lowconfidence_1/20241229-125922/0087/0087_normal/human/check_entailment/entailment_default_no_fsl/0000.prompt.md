You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a 120 minute videotape with standard recording. When I set the VCR counter to 00:00:00 with the tape completely rewound and recorded in standard recording mode, I got a certain counter value. Enter this counter value (hours, minutes, seconds), find the length of the remaining tape (recordable time), and create a program that outputs in the format of hours: minutes: seconds.

However, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). The remaining amount of tape is calculated in two ways, standard recording mode and triple recording mode, and outputs two digits each for hours, minutes, and seconds as shown in the output example. If the tens digit is 0, such as "05", add "0".



input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows.


T H S


T, H, and S are integers that represent hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

Input ends when T, H, and S are all -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

For each dataset
On the first line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded as standard, separated by half-width colons.
On the second line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded three times are separated by half-width colons.
Please output.

Example

Input

1 30 0
-1 -1 -1


Output

00:30:00
01:30:00
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds // 3)

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `seconds`, a non-negative integer representing the total seconds of the tape used (up to 7200 seconds). It calculates the remaining time on the tape in hours, minutes, and seconds and prints this time in the format `HH:MM:SS`. The function does not return any value. The printed time represents the remaining duration of the tape, which is the difference between 7200 seconds (2 hours) and the input `seconds`. If `seconds` is 7200 or more, the printed time will be `00:00:00`. If `seconds` is less than 0, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes a non-negative input.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
