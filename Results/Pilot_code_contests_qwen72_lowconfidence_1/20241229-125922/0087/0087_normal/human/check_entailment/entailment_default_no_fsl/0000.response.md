Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conversion from standard recording mode to triple recording mode. Specifically, the line `func_1(seconds // 3)` is incorrect because it divides the used time by 3 instead of dividing the remaining time by 3. This results in an incorrect calculation for the triple recording mode.

For example, if the input is `1 30 0` (which is 90 minutes or 5400 seconds), the remaining time in standard recording mode is 30 minutes (1800 seconds). However, the remaining time in triple recording mode should be 90 minutes (5400 seconds), but the program incorrectly calculates it as 30 minutes (1800 seconds).

To fix this, the program should calculate the remaining time in seconds first and then divide it by 3 for the triple recording mode:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    remaining_seconds = 7200 - seconds
    func_1(remaining_seconds)
    func_1(remaining_seconds // 3)

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))
```

This corrected version ensures that the remaining time in both standard and triple recording modes is calculated correctly.
