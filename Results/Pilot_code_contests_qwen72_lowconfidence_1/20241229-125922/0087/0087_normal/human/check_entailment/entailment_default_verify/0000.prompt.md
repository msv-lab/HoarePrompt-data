You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a 120 minute videotape with standard recording. When I set the VCR counter to 00:00:00 with the tape completely rewound and recorded in standard recording mode, I got a certain counter value. Enter this counter value (hours, minutes, seconds), find the length of the remaining tape (recordable time), and create a program that outputs in the format of hours: minutes: seconds.

However, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). The remaining amount of tape is calculated in two ways, standard recording mode and triple recording mode, and outputs two digits each for hours, minutes, and seconds as shown in the output example. If the tens digit is 0, such as "05", add "0".



input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows.


T H S


T, H, and S are integers that represent hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

Input ends when T, H, and S are all -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

For each dataset
On the first line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded as standard, separated by half-width colons.
On the second line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded three times are separated by half-width colons.
Please output.

Example

Input

1 30 0
-1 -1 -1


Output

00:30:00
01:30:00
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds // 3)

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is called twice, but the second call uses `seconds // 3`, which calculates the time for triple recording mode incorrectly. It should calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode by dividing the total remaining time by 3, not the elapsed time.

2. The program does not handle the case where the input time exceeds 120 minutes. According to the problem description, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). If the input exceeds this limit, the program should not proceed with the calculation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func_1(total_seconds, factor=1):
    seconds = total_seconds * factor
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    if seconds > 7200:
        continue  # Skip invalid inputs
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds, 3)
```

This version correctly handles the calculation for both standard and triple recording modes and skips invalid inputs where the elapsed time exceeds 120 minutes.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `seconds`, a non-negative integer representing the total seconds of the tape used (up to 7200 seconds). It calculates the remaining time on the tape in hours, minutes, and seconds and prints this time in the format `HH:MM:SS`. The function does not return any value. The printed time represents the remaining duration of the tape, which is the difference between 7200 seconds (2 hours) and the input `seconds`. If `seconds` is 7200 or more, the printed time will be `00:00:00`. If `seconds` is less than 0, the behavior is undefined as the function assumes a non-negative input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
