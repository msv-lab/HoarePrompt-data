You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a 120 minute videotape with standard recording. When I set the VCR counter to 00:00:00 with the tape completely rewound and recorded in standard recording mode, I got a certain counter value. Enter this counter value (hours, minutes, seconds), find the length of the remaining tape (recordable time), and create a program that outputs in the format of hours: minutes: seconds.

However, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). The remaining amount of tape is calculated in two ways, standard recording mode and triple recording mode, and outputs two digits each for hours, minutes, and seconds as shown in the output example. If the tens digit is 0, such as "05", add "0".



input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows.


T H S


T, H, and S are integers that represent hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

Input ends when T, H, and S are all -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

For each dataset
On the first line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded as standard, separated by half-width colons.
On the second line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded three times are separated by half-width colons.
Please output.

Example

Input

1 30 0
-1 -1 -1


Output

00:30:00
01:30:00
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds // 3)

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
