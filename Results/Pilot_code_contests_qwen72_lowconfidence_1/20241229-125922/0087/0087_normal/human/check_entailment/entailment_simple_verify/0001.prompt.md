You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a 120 minute videotape with standard recording. When I set the VCR counter to 00:00:00 with the tape completely rewound and recorded in standard recording mode, I got a certain counter value. Enter this counter value (hours, minutes, seconds), find the length of the remaining tape (recordable time), and create a program that outputs in the format of hours: minutes: seconds.

However, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). The remaining amount of tape is calculated in two ways, standard recording mode and triple recording mode, and outputs two digits each for hours, minutes, and seconds as shown in the output example. If the tens digit is 0, such as "05", add "0".



input

Given multiple datasets. Each dataset is as follows.


T H S


T, H, and S are integers that represent hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

Input ends when T, H, and S are all -1. The number of datasets does not exceed 50.

output

For each dataset
On the first line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded as standard, separated by half-width colons.
On the second line, the hours, minutes, and seconds of the recordable time when the rest of the tape is recorded three times are separated by half-width colons.
Please output.

Example

Input

1 30 0
-1 -1 -1


Output

00:30:00
01:30:00
Program:
```
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds // 3)

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input time exceeds the total duration of the tape (120 minutes or 7200 seconds). According to the problem description, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). However, the program does not check if the input time is within this limit. For example, if the input is `2 0 0` (which represents 2 hours and 0 minutes), the program will still attempt to calculate the remaining tape time, which is incorrect because the input exceeds the maximum allowed time.

Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the remaining time based on a fixed total of 7200 seconds, but it does not account for the possibility that the input time might be invalid (i.e., greater than 7200 seconds). This can lead to negative values being printed, which is not expected according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program should include a validation step to ensure that the input time is within the valid range (0 to 7200 seconds). If the input is out of range, the program should either skip processing that input or provide an appropriate error message.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds // 3)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: seconds is a non-negative integer representing the total seconds of the tape used, where the total input time does not exceed 7200 seconds (2 hours).
def func_1(seconds):
    h, remain = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    m, s = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
