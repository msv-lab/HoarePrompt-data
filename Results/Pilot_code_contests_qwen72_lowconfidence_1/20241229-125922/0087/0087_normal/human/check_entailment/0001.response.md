Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input time exceeds the total duration of the tape (120 minutes or 7200 seconds). According to the problem description, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes). However, the program does not check if the input time is within this limit. For example, if the input is `2 0 0` (which represents 2 hours and 0 minutes), the program will still attempt to calculate the remaining tape time, which is incorrect because the input exceeds the maximum allowed time.

Additionally, the function `func_1` calculates the remaining time based on a fixed total of 7200 seconds, but it does not account for the possibility that the input time might be invalid (i.e., greater than 7200 seconds). This can lead to negative values being printed, which is not expected according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program should include a validation step to ensure that the input time is within the valid range (0 to 7200 seconds). If the input is out of range, the program should either skip processing that input or provide an appropriate error message.
