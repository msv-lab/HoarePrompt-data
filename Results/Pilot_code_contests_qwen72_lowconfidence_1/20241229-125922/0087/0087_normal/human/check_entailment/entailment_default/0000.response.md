Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input `seconds` is greater than 7200. According to the problem description, the input must be within 2 hours (120 minutes), but the program does not enforce this constraint. If the input exceeds 7200 seconds, the program will still attempt to calculate the remaining time, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if the input is `2 0 1` (which corresponds to 7201 seconds), the program will output:

```
00:00:00
00:00:00
```

This is incorrect because the input should be within the specified range, and the program should either reject such inputs or handle them appropriately. Additionally, the function `func_1` is called twice with different parameters, but the second call should use `seconds * 3` instead of `seconds // 3` to calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode. This is another issue that makes the program incorrect.

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Validate the input to ensure it is within the specified range (0 to 7200 seconds).
2. Correct the calculation for the triple recording mode to use `seconds * 3` instead of `seconds // 3`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function, unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func_1(seconds):
    (h, remain) = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    (m, s) = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and s == -1:
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    if seconds < 0 or seconds > 7200:
        print("Invalid input. Time must be between 00:00:00 and 02:00:00.")
        continue
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1(seconds * 3)
```

This version ensures that the input is within the valid range and correctly calculates the remaining time for both standard and triple recording modes.
