Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Handling of Triple Recording Mode**:
   - The program correctly calculates and prints the remaining time for standard recording mode using the function `func_1(seconds)`.
   - However, for triple recording mode, the program calls `func_1(seconds // 3)`, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the remaining time in triple recording mode should be three times the remaining time in standard recording mode. Therefore, the correct calculation should be `func_1((7200 - seconds) * 3)` instead of `func_1(seconds // 3)`.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly formats the output in the required `HH:MM:SS` format using `print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))`.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and stops processing when `h == -1`, `m == -1`, and `s == -1`.

To correct the program, the line `func_1(seconds // 3)` should be replaced with `func_1((7200 - seconds) * 3)` to correctly calculate the remaining time in triple recording mode.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import (division, absolute_import, print_function,
                        unicode_literals)
from sys import stdin

def func_1(seconds):
    h, remain = divmod(7200 - seconds, 3600)
    m, s = divmod(remain, 60)
    print('{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}'.format(h, m, s))

for line in stdin:
    (h, m, s) = (int(s) for s in line.split())
    if h == -1 and m == -1 and (s == -1):
        break
    seconds = h * 3600 + m * 60 + s
    func_1(seconds)
    func_1((7200 - seconds) * 3)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate and output the remaining tape time for both standard and triple recording modes as specified in the problem description.
