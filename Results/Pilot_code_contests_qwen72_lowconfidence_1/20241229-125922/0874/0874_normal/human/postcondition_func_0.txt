The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but relies on external variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `md` such that a computed value `val` (which depends on `a`, `b`, `l`, `m`, and `md`) is less than or equal to `t`. The function returns this maximum value `md` as `ans`. If no such `md` is found, `ans` is set to `-1`. After the function execution, the variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` retain their original values, while `be` and `en` are updated to reflect the final state of the binary search.
