Output State: **`be` is greater than `en`, `ans` is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` â‰¤ `t` during the loop execution, `all` is `a * (ans - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(ans - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))`, `val` is `max(ceil1(all, m), a + (ans - 1) * b)`, `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` retain their original values, `en` is the last valid midpoint or `l - 1` if no valid midpoint is found, `be` is `ans + 1` or `10^7 + 1` if no valid midpoint is found.**
