To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to check the condition `be <= en`. According to the given state, `be` is initialized to `l` and `en` is initialized to \(10^7\).

Given:
- `be` is `l` (where \(1 \leq l \leq 10^6\))
- `en` is \(10^7\)

Since \(1 \leq l \leq 10^6\) and `en` is \(10^7\), the condition `be <= en` will always be true because \(10^6\) is less than \(10^7\). Therefore, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For each query, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6. `be` is `l`, `en` is 10^7, `ans` is -1**
