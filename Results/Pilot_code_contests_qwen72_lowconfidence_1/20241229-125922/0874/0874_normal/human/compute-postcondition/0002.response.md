The code snippet provided calculates the value of `md` using the formula `be + en >> 1`, which is equivalent to `(be + en) // 2` in Python, performing integer division by 2. Given the initial state:

- `be` is `l`
- `en` is `10^7`
- `ans` is `-1`

The calculation for `md` is:

- `md = (l + 10^7) // 2`

Since the values of `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` are not directly modified by this code snippet, they remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For each query, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6. `be` is `l`, `en` is 10^7, `ans` is -1, `md` is `(l + 10^7) // 2`.**
