Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but relies on external variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `md` such that a computed value `val` (which depends on `a`, `b`, `l`, `m`, and `md`) is less than or equal to `t`. The function returns this maximum value `md` as `ans`. If no such `md` is found, `ans` is set to `-1`. After the function execution, the variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` retain their original values, while `be` and `en` are updated to reflect the final state of the binary search. ** 

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Initial Values**: The function assumes that `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` are already defined and meet the specified constraints (1 ≤ A, B, n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6).
- **No Valid Midpoint**: If no valid `md` is found such that `val` ≤ `t`, the function correctly sets `ans` to `-1`.
- **Binary Search Range**: The initial range for the binary search is set from `l` to `10^7`. This range ensures that the search covers a wide enough space, but it might need to be adjusted if `l` is very close to `10^7`.
- **Sum and Ceiling Functions**: The function uses `sum_n` and `ceil1` functions, which are not defined in the provided code. These functions must be implemented correctly for the function to work as intended.
- **Edge Case for `l`**: If `l` is 1, the term `sum_n(max(l - 2, 0))` will always be `sum_n(0)`, which should be handled appropriately by the `sum_n` function.
- **Edge Case for `t`**: If `t` is very small, the function may quickly determine that no valid `md` exists and set `ans` to `-1`.

### Final State:
- **Return Value**: The function returns `ans`, which is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution. If no such `md` is found, `ans` is `-1`.
- **Variable States**:
  - `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` retain their original values.
  - `be` is `ans + 1` or `10^7 + 1` if no valid midpoint is found.
  - `en` is the last valid midpoint or `l - 1` if no valid midpoint is found.
