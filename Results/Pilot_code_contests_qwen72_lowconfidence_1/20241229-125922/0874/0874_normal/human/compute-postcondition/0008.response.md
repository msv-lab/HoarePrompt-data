Postcondition: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6, be is l, en is 10^7, ans is -1, md is (l + 10^7) // 2, all is A * (md - l + 1) + B * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0))), val is max(ceil1(all, m), a + (md - 1) * b), and val > t**
