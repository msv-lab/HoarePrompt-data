The given code snippet calculates the value of `all` using the provided formula. Let's break down the calculation:

- `A` and `B` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^6.
- `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5.
- `l`, `t`, and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^6.
- `be` is set to `l`.
- `en` is set to 10^7.
- `ans` is set to -1.
- `md` is calculated as `(l + 10^7) // 2`.

The formula for `all` is:
```
all = A * (md - l + 1) + B * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))
```

Let's compute the value of `all` step by step:

1. **Calculate `md`**:
   - `md = (l + 10^7) // 2`

2. **Calculate the first term in the formula**:
   - First term: `A * (md - l + 1)`

3. **Calculate the second term in the formula**:
   - Second term: `B * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))`

4. **Combine the terms to get `all`**:
   - `all = A * (md - l + 1) + B * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))`

The values of `A`, `B`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the new variable `all` is computed.

Output State: **A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6, be is l, en is 10^7, ans is -1, md is (l + 10^7) // 2, all is A * (md - l + 1) + B * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))**
