The function `func_1` does not explicitly show any parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it appears that the function likely operates on some internal state or uses global variables, as the description mentions `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` without explicitly passing them as parameters.

Given the constraints and the described output, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to compute and return `ans`, which is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution. The values of `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` are involved in the computation, but they are not explicitly passed as parameters in the function signature.

Functionality: **The function computes and returns `ans`, which is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution.**
