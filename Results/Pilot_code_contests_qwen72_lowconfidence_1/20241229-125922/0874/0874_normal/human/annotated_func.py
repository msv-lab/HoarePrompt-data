#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For each query, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    be, en, ans = l, 10 ** 7, -1
    while be <= en:
        md = be + en >> 1
        
        all = a * (md - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))
        
        val = max(ceil1(all, m), a + (md - 1) * b)
        
        if val <= t:
            be = md + 1
            ans = md
        else:
            en = md - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `be` is greater than `en`, `ans` is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution, `all` is `a * (ans - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(ans - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))`, `val` is `max(ceil1(all, m), a + (ans - 1) * b)`, `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` retain their original values, `en` is the last valid midpoint or `l - 1` if no valid midpoint is found, `be` is `ans + 1` or `10^7 + 1` if no valid midpoint is found.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but relies on external variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `md` such that a computed value `val` (which depends on `a`, `b`, `l`, `m`, and `md`) is less than or equal to `t`. The function returns this maximum value `md` as `ans`. If no such `md` is found, `ans` is set to `-1`. After the function execution, the variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` retain their original values, while `be` and `en` are updated to reflect the final state of the binary search.
