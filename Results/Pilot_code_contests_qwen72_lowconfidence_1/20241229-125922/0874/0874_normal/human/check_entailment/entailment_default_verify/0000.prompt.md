You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Karafs is some kind of vegetable in shape of an 1 × h rectangle. Tavaspolis people love Karafs and they use Karafs in almost any kind of food. Tavas, himself, is crazy about Karafs.

<image>

Each Karafs has a positive integer height. Tavas has an infinite 1-based sequence of Karafses. The height of the i-th Karafs is si = A + (i - 1) × B.

For a given m, let's define an m-bite operation as decreasing the height of at most m distinct not eaten Karafses by 1. Karafs is considered as eaten when its height becomes zero.

Now SaDDas asks you n queries. In each query he gives you numbers l, t and m and you should find the largest number r such that l ≤ r and sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr can be eaten by performing m-bite no more than t times or print -1 if there is no such number r.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers A, B and n (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106, 1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Next n lines contain information about queries. i-th line contains integers l, t, m (1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 106) for i-th query.

Output

For each query, print its answer in a single line.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

ceil1 = lambda a, b: (a + b - 1) // b
sum_n = lambda n: n * (n + 1) // 2
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(a, b, n) = rints()
(qur, out) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], [])
for (l, t, m) in qur:
    out.append(func_1())
print('\n'.join(map(str, out)))

def func_1():
    (be, en, ans) = (l, 10 ** 7, -1)
    while be <= en:
        md = be + en >> 1
        all = a * (md - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))
        val = max(ceil1(all, m), a + (md - 1) * b)
        if val <= t:
            be = md + 1
            ans = md
        else:
            en = md - 1
    return ans


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that performs a binary search to find the largest index `r` such that the sequence from `sl` to `sr` can be eaten within `t` m-bites. The main loop processes each query and calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters. The calculations for the total height of the Karafses and the number of bites required are handled correctly, and the binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs. After reviewing the logic and considering various edge cases, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes no explicit parameters but relies on external variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n`. It performs a binary search to find the maximum value `md` such that a computed value `val` (which depends on `a`, `b`, `l`, `m`, and `md`) is less than or equal to `t`. The function returns this maximum value `md` as `ans`. If no such `md` is found, `ans` is set to `-1`. After the function execution, the variables `a`, `b`, `l`, `t`, `m`, and `n` retain their original values, while `be` and `en` are updated to reflect the final state of the binary search.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
