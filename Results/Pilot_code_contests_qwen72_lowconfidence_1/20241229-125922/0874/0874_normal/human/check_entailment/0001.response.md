Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it initializes the variable `en` in the binary search loop. The value `10 ** 7` is used as an upper bound, but this might not be sufficient for all possible inputs, especially when `l` is very large and the sequence grows quickly. This could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs where the correct `r` value exceeds this bound.

Additionally, the function `func_1()` is called without passing the necessary parameters, which will result in a runtime error because the variables `l`, `t`, and `m` are not defined within the scope of `func_1()`.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
from sys import stdin

ceil1 = lambda a, b: (a + b - 1) // b
sum_n = lambda n: n * (n + 1) // 2
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(a, b, n) = rints()
(qur, out) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], [])
for (l, t, m) in qur:
    out.append(func_1(l, t, m))
print('\n'.join(map(str, out)))

def func_1(l, t, m):
    (be, en, ans) = (l, 10 ** 9, -1)  # Increase the upper bound to handle larger values
    while be <= en:
        md = be + en >> 1
        all = a * (md - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))
        val = max(ceil1(all, m), a + (md - 1) * b)
        if val <= t:
            be = md + 1
            ans = md
        else:
            en = md - 1
    return ans
```

This version increases the upper bound to `10 ** 9` to ensure it covers a wider range of possible values and passes the necessary parameters to `func_1()`. However, the original program as provided does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
