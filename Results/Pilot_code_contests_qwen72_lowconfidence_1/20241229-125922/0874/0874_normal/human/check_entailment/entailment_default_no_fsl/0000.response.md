Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called without passing the required parameters `l`, `t`, and `m`, which are necessary for the function to operate correctly. This oversight means that the function will not behave as intended, leading to incorrect results.

Additionally, the binary search logic within `func_1` might not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the sequence of Karafses cannot be fully eaten within the given constraints. For example, if the height of the Karafses grows too quickly, the function might incorrectly return a value where the Karafses cannot actually be eaten within the given time `t`.

To ensure correctness, the function `func_1` should be called with the appropriate parameters, and the binary search logic should be thoroughly tested against various edge cases, including those where the Karafses cannot be eaten within the given constraints.
