Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Let's break down the key components and verify their correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the values of `A`, `B`, and `n` from the input.
   - It then reads `n` queries, each containing `l`, `t`, and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for processing each query and determining the largest `r` such that the sequence `sl, sl+1, ..., sr` can be eaten within `t` m-bite operations.
   - The function uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `r` that satisfies the condition.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed over the range `[l, 10^7]`.
   - For each midpoint `md`, the program calculates the total height of the Karafses from `l` to `md` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{all} = A \times (md - l + 1) + B \times \left(\frac{md \times (md - 1)}{2} - \frac{\max(l - 2, 0) \times (l - 1)}{2}\right)
     \]
   - It then calculates the value `val` as:
     \[
     \text{val} = \max\left(\left\lceil \frac{\text{all}}{m} \right\rceil, A + (md - 1) \times B\right)
     \]
   - If `val` is less than or equal to `t`, it updates `ans` to `md` and continues searching in the upper half. Otherwise, it searches in the lower half.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of `func_1` for each query to the `out` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all queries.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Binary Search Range:**
  - The range `[l, 10^7]` is chosen because the height of the Karafses grows linearly with `i`, and the maximum possible value for `r` is bounded by the constraints.

- **Total Height Calculation:**
  - The formula for the total height of the Karafses from `l` to `md` is derived correctly from the arithmetic series sum formula.

- **Value Calculation:**
  - The value `val` is calculated as the maximum of the total number of m-bite operations needed and the height of the tallest Karafs in the range. This ensures that both the total height and the height of the tallest Karafs are considered.

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search correctly narrows down the range to find the maximum `r` that satisfies the condition. If no valid `r` is found, it returns `-1`.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints the results for each query in the required format.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
