You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Karafs is some kind of vegetable in shape of an 1 × h rectangle. Tavaspolis people love Karafs and they use Karafs in almost any kind of food. Tavas, himself, is crazy about Karafs.

<image>

Each Karafs has a positive integer height. Tavas has an infinite 1-based sequence of Karafses. The height of the i-th Karafs is si = A + (i - 1) × B.

For a given m, let's define an m-bite operation as decreasing the height of at most m distinct not eaten Karafses by 1. Karafs is considered as eaten when its height becomes zero.

Now SaDDas asks you n queries. In each query he gives you numbers l, t and m and you should find the largest number r such that l ≤ r and sequence sl, sl + 1, ..., sr can be eaten by performing m-bite no more than t times or print -1 if there is no such number r.

Input

The first line of input contains three integers A, B and n (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106, 1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

Next n lines contain information about queries. i-th line contains integers l, t, m (1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 106) for i-th query.

Output

For each query, print its answer in a single line.

Examples

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from sys import stdin

ceil1 = lambda a, b: (a + b - 1) // b
sum_n = lambda n: n * (n + 1) // 2
rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(a, b, n) = rints()
(qur, out) = ([rints() for _ in range(n)], [])
for (l, t, m) in qur:
    out.append(func_1())
print('\n'.join(map(str, out)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A and B are positive integers such that 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10^6, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For each query, l, t, and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l, t, m ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    be, en, ans = l, 10 ** 7, -1
    while be <= en:
        md = be + en >> 1
        
        all = a * (md - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(md - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))
        
        val = max(ceil1(all, m), a + (md - 1) * b)
        
        if val <= t:
            be = md + 1
            ans = md
        else:
            en = md - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `be` is greater than `en`, `ans` is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution, `all` is `a * (ans - l + 1) + b * (sum_n(ans - 1) - sum_n(max(l - 2, 0)))`, `val` is `max(ceil1(all, m), a + (ans - 1) * b)`, `A`, `B`, `n`, `l`, `t`, and `m` retain their original values, `en` is the last valid midpoint or `l - 1` if no valid midpoint is found, `be` is `ans + 1` or `10^7 + 1` if no valid midpoint is found.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the maximum value of `md` such that `val` ≤ `t` during the loop execution.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
