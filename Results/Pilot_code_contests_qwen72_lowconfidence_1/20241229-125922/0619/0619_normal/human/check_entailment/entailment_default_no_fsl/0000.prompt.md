You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

        print(a1)

        m0 = 0
        for i in a:
            m1 = max(m1, ansr ^ i)

Output hints: The function `func` reads two lines of input: the first line is a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) indicating the number of integers, and the second line is a space-separated list of `n` integers `a` where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^30 - 1. It then processes these integers to find the minimum possible maximum XOR value between any two integers in the list. The function converts each integer in `a` to its 32-bit binary representation, reverses the binary string, and pads it with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters. These reversed binary strings are stored in a list `s`.

The function iterates over the bits of the binary representations from the most significant bit (bit 31) to the least significant bit (bit 0). For each bit position, it counts the number of '0's and '1's at that position across all strings in `s`. If all bits at the current position are the same (either all '0's or all '1's), it appends the corresponding bit ('0' or '1') to the string `ans`. If there is a mix of '0's and '1's, it sets `ans` to the current prefix and calculates two values: `ansl` (the maximum value of the reversed binary string of the first part of any string in `s` that has '0' at the breaking bit position) and `ansr` (the maximum value of the reversed binary string of the first part of any string in `s` that has '1' at the breaking bit position). It then breaks out of the loop.

If the loop completes without breaking, it calculates the maximum XOR value of `leftp` (the integer value of `ans`) with each integer in `a` and prints this maximum value. If the loop breaks, it calculates the maximum XOR values of `ansr` and `ansl` with each integer in `a`, and prints the minimum of these two maximum values.

Edge Cases:
- If the list `a` contains only one element, the function will still process it but will not find any XOR value since there are no other elements to compare.
- If all integers in `a` are the same, the function will correctly identify that the maximum XOR value is 0.
- If `a` is an empty list, the function will not handle this case correctly as it assumes `a` is non-empty. This could lead to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
