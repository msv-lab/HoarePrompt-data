You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible value of \(\max_{1 \leq i \leq n} (a_i \oplus X)\). The program constructs a binary representation of each number, processes these representations to determine the optimal \(X\), and then calculates the maximum XOR value for the chosen \(X\). The logic for handling different bit positions and determining the optimal \(X\) seems thorough and handles edge cases such as all numbers having the same bit pattern at a certain position. Given the complexity of the problem and the thoroughness of the implementation, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
