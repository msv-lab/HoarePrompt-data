Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all numbers in the array are the same. In this specific scenario, the program should return 0, as the XOR of any number with itself is 0, and thus the maximum XOR value would be 0. However, the program's logic for determining the minimum possible value of the maximum XOR does not account for this edge case correctly. 

For example, consider the input:
```
Input:
3
4 4 4
```
The expected output is 0, but the program will not produce this output because it incorrectly assumes that there is a bit position where not all bits are the same. This leads to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
