You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and challenged him to choose an integer X such that the value \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X) is minimum possible, where ⊕ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Input

The first line contains integer n (1≤ n ≤ 10^5).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 2^{30}-1).

Output

Print one integer — the minimum possible value of \underset{1 ≤ i ≤ n}{max} (a_i ⊕ X).

Examples

Note

In the first sample, we can choose X = 3.

In the second sample, we can choose X = 5.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
