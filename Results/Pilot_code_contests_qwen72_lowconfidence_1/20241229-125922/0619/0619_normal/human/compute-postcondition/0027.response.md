The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string stored in `ts`. Given that `ts` is the non-reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix, after this operation, `ts` will now contain the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least three elements, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` (padded to 32 characters) followed by the non-reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix.
