The code snippet appends a '0' to the string `ts`. Given the initial conditions, `ts` is already the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix, followed by '00'. After appending '0', `ts` will now end with '000'.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least two elements, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` (padded to 32 characters), `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix plus '000'.
