The code `ts += '0'` appends the character `'0'` to the string `ts`. Since `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` (the first element in the list `a`) without the '0b' prefix, appending `'0'` to `ts` adds a '0' to this reversed binary string.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element
- `s` is an empty list
- `i` is the first element in the list `a`
- `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, followed by the character '0'

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, followed by the character '0'**
