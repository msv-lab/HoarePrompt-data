The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the new value of `n` should still satisfy this condition. The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 2^30-1.**
