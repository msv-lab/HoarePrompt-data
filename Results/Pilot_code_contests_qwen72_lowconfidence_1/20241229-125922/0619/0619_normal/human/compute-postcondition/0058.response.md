Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. If the character at position `j` in the string `s[i]` is '0', then `c0` is 3 and `c1` is 0. If the character at position `j` in the string `s[i]` is '1', then `c1` is 3 and `c0` is 0.***
