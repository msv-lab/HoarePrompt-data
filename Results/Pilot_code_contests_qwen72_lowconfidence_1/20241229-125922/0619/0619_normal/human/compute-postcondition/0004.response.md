The code `ts = bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` (the first element of the list `a`) to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.

- `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
- The binary representation of `i` is stored in the variable `ts`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `ts` is the binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix.**
