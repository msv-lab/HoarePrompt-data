The code snippet `mx1 = max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` updates the value of `mx1` by comparing it with the integer value of the substring of `s[i]` from the start up to but not including position `j`, reversed and converted from binary to decimal.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\)
- `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters)
- `j` is 30
- `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`
- `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`
- `ans` is '11'
- `brk` is -1
- `leftp` is 3221225472
- `ansl` is 2147483648 + `mx0`
- `ansr` is 2147483648 + `mx1`
- `i` is 1
- `mx0` is 0
- `mx1` is `int(s[1][:30][::-1], 2)` if `s[1][j]` is '1', otherwise `mx1` is 0
- `c1` is not equal to `n`
- `c0` is not equal to `n`

Let's analyze the impact of the code snippet:

1. `s[i][:j][::-1]`: This takes the substring of `s[i]` from the start up to but not including position `j` (which is 30), reverses it, and converts it to an integer from its binary representation.
2. `int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2)`: Converts the reversed binary substring to an integer.
3. `max(mx1, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))`: Compares the current value of `mx1` with the new integer value obtained and assigns the maximum of the two to `mx1`.

Since `i` is 1, the specific value of `s[1][:30][::-1]` will be used to update `mx1`. Let's denote this value as `new_val`.

If `s[1][j]` is '1', then `mx1` was initially set to `int(s[1][:30][::-1], 2)`. Otherwise, `mx1` was initially 0.

After executing the code snippet, the new value of `mx1` will be:
- `mx1` if `mx1` is already greater than or equal to `new_val`
- `new_val` if `new_val` is greater than `mx1`

Thus, the updated value of `mx1` will be the maximum of the initial `mx1` and `new_val`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`, `ans` is '11', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 3221225472, `ansl` is 2147483648 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 2147483648 + `mx1`, `i` is 1, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is `max(mx1, int(s[1][:30][::-1], 2))`, `c1` is not equal to `n`, and `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
