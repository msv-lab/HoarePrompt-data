The code snippet `leftp <<= j` shifts the bits of `leftp` to the left by `j` positions. Given that `j` is 30, `leftp` which was initially 3, will be shifted left by 30 positions. This operation effectively multiplies `leftp` by \(2^{30}\).

Therefore, the new value of `leftp` is \(3 \times 2^{30}\). Since \(2^{30} = 1073741824\), the new value of `leftp` is \(3 \times 1073741824 = 3221225472\).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`, `ans` is '11', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 3221225472, `ansl` is 2147483648 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 2147483648 + `mx1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, and `c1` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
