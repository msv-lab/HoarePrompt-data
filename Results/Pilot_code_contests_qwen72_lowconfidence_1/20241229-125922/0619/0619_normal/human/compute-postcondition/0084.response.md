Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `ans` is "1", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is -1, `ansr` is -1, `j` is 31, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j` for the first 2 elements, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j` for the first 2 elements, `i` is 2. If `s[2][31]` is '0', `mx0` is the integer value of the reversed binary string of the first 31 characters of `s[2]`, and `mx1` is 0. If `s[2][31]` is '1', `mx0` is 0, and `mx1` is the integer value of the reversed binary string of the first 31 characters of `s[2]`.***
