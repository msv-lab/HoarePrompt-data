The code `ts = ts[::-1]` reverses the string `ts`.

- `ts` was initially the binary string representation of `i` (the first element of the list `a`) without the '0b' prefix.
- After the code executes, `ts` is reversed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix.**
