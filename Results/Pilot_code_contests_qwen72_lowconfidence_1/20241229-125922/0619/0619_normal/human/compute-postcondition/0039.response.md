Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters). If `a` is empty, `s` remains an empty list, `ans` is an empty string, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0.**
