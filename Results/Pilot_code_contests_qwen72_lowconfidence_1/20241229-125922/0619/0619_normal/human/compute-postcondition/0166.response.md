The code snippet `ans += '1'` updates the variable `ans` by appending the character '1' to its current value. The initial value of `ans` is '11', so after the execution, `ans` will be '111'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 29, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position 29, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position 29, `brk` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is '111', `leftp` is 3221225472, `ansl` is 3221225472 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 3221225472 + `mx1`, and `c1` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
