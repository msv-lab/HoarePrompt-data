The code `leftp <<= j` performs a left shift operation on the variable `leftp` by `j` positions. Given that `j` is 29, `leftp` will be shifted left by 29 positions.

Initially, `leftp` is 7. In binary, 7 is represented as `00000000000000000000000000000111`. Shifting this value left by 29 positions results in `11100000000000000000000000000000`, which is `7 << 29`.

Calculating the new value:
\[ 7 \times 2^{29} = 7 \times 536870912 = 3758096384 \]

Therefore, `leftp` is now 3758096384.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The updated state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 29, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position 29, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position 29, `brk` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `mx0` is 0, `mx1` is 0, `ans` is '111', `leftp` is 3758096384, `ansl` is 3221225472 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 3221225472 + `mx1`, and `c1` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
