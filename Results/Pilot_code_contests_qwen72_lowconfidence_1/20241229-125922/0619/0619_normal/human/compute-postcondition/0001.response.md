The code `a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This operation updates the value of `a` from its initial state (a list of `n` integers) to a new list of integers read from the input.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the specified range, and the new list `a` now contains the integers input by the user, which may differ in length and values from the original list, but each element still satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 2^30-1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 2^30-1.**
