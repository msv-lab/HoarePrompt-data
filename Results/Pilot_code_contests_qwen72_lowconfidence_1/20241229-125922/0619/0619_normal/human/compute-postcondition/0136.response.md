The given code snippet updates the value of `ansr` by setting it to the sum of `leftp` and `mx1`. We need to follow the initial state and the changes made by this line of code to determine the final state.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\)
- `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters)
- `j` is 30
- `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`
- `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`
- `ans` is '11'
- `brk` is -1
- `leftp` is 3221225472
- `ansl` is 3221225472 + `mx0`
- `ansr` is 2147483648 + `mx1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `mx0` is the maximum integer value obtained from the first `j` characters (reversed and converted to an integer) of any string in `s` that has '0' at position `j`
- `mx1` is the maximum integer value obtained from the first `j` characters (reversed and converted to an integer) of any string in `s` that has '1' at position `j`
- `c1` is not equal to `n`
- `c0` is not equal to `n`

### Code Execution:
The code snippet is:
```python
ansr = leftp + mx1
```

### Impact of the Code:
- `ansr` is updated to the sum of `leftp` and `mx1`.

### Calculation:
- `leftp` is 3221225472
- `mx1` is the maximum integer value obtained from the first `j` characters (reversed and converted to an integer) of any string in `s` that has '1' at position `j`.

Thus, the new value of `ansr` is:
\[ \text{ansr} = 3221225472 + \text{mx1} \]

### Final State:
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 30, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`, `ans` is '11', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 3221225472, `ansl` is 3221225472 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 3221225472 + `mx1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mx0` is the maximum integer value obtained from the first `j` characters (reversed and converted to an integer) of any string in `s` that has '0' at position `j`, `mx1` is the maximum integer value obtained from the first `j` characters (reversed and converted to an integer) of any string in `s` that has '1' at position `j`, `c1` is not equal to `n`, and `c0` is not equal to `n`.**
