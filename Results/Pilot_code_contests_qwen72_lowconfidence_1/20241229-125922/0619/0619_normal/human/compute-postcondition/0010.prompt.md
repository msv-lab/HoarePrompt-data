You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: The code snippet `ts += '0'` appends an additional '0' to the string `ts`. Given that `ts` was initially the reversed binary string representation of the first element `i` in the list `a`, followed by the character '0', appending another '0' changes the value of `ts`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- The list `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), and `a` has at least one element.
- The list `s` remains an empty list.
- The variable `i` remains the first element in the list `a`.
- The string `ts` now contains the reversed binary string representation of `i` followed by two '0's.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, followed by the characters '00'.**
```
while len(ts) < 32:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
