The code snippet `ts += '0'` appends the character '0' to the end of the string `ts`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least two elements
- `s` is a list containing the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` (padded to 32 characters)
- `i` is the second element in the list `a`
- `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix plus '0' (not necessarily padded to 32 characters)

After executing the code snippet, the only change is to the variable `ts`. The new value of `ts` will be the original value of `ts` followed by the character '0'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least two elements, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` (padded to 32 characters), `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of the second element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix plus '00'**
