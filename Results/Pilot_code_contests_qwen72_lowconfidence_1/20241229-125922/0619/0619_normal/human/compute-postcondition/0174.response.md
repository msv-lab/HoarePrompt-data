Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 29, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position 29, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position 29, `brk` is -1, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is '111', `leftp` is 3758096384, `c1` is not equal to `n`, and `c0` is not equal to `n`. If the 29th character of the string `s[i]` is '0', then `mx0` is 1717986918 and `mx1` is 0, resulting in `ansl` being 4939212390 and `ansr` being 3221225472. If the 29th character of the string `s[i]` is '1', then `mx0` remains 0 and `mx1` is the integer obtained from converting the reversed first 29 characters of `s[i]` from binary to an integer, resulting in `ansl` being 3221225472 and `ansr` being 3221225472 + the converted integer.***
