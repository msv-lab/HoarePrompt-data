Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 31, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position `j`, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position `j`, and `c1` is not equal to `n`. If `c0` is equal to `n`, `ans` is '0', `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 0, `ansl` is -1, and `ansr` is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is "1", `brk` is -1, `leftp` is 2147483648, `ansl` is 2147483648 + `mx0`, `ansr` is 2147483648 + `mx1`, `i` is `n-1`, `mx0` is the maximum integer value of the reversed binary string of the first 31 characters of any string in `s` that has '0' at position `j`, and `mx1` is the maximum integer value of the reversed binary string of the first 31 characters of any string in `s` that has '1' at position `j`.***
