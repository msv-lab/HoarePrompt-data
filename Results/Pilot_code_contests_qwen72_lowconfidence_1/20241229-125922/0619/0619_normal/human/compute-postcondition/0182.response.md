Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `j` is 29, `c0` is the count of strings in `s` that have '0' at position 29, `c1` is the count of strings in `s` that have '1' at position 29, `brk` is -1, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is '111', `leftp` is 3758096384, `c1` is not equal to `n`, `c0` is not equal to `n`. If `s[i][j]` == '0', then `mx0` is updated to `max(mx0, int(s[i][:j][::-1], 2))` and `mx1` remains unchanged. If `s[i][j]` != '0', then `mx1` is updated to `max(mx1, int(s[n-2][:29][::-1], 2))` and `mx0` remains unchanged. `ansl` is 4939212390 or 3221225472, `ansr` is 3221225472 or 3221225472 + the converted integer.***
