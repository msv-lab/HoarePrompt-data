The code snippet `ts += '0'` appends the character `'0'` to the end of the string `ts`. The variable `ts` initially holds the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix. After executing this code, the length of `ts` increases by one, and the last character of `ts` is now `'0'`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least three elements, `s` is a list containing the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` (padded to 32 characters) followed by the non-reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of the third element in the list `a` without the '0b' prefix followed by '0'.**
