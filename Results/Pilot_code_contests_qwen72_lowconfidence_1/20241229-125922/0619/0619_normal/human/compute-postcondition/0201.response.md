Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), `s` is a list of 32-character strings where each string is the reversed binary representation of the corresponding integer in `a` (padded with zeros to ensure a length of 32 characters), `ans` is a string representing the binary prefix of the maximum integer in `a` up to the point where the loop breaks, `brk` is -1, `leftp` is the integer value of `ans` shifted left by the remaining number of bits (from 31 down to 0), `ansl` is the maximum integer value of the reversed binary string of the first part of any string in `s` that has '0' at the breaking bit position, `ansr` is the maximum integer value of the reversed binary string of the first part of any string in `s` that has '1' at the breaking bit position. If the loop completes without breaking, `ans` will be a 32-bit binary string, `leftp` will be the integer value of `ans`, and `ansl` and `ansr` will both be -1. Additionally, `ansl` is not -1.**
