The code snippet `ts += '0'` appends an additional '0' to the string `ts`. Given that `ts` was initially the reversed binary string representation of the first element `i` in the list `a`, followed by the character '0', appending another '0' changes the value of `ts`.

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- The list `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\), and `a` has at least one element.
- The list `s` remains an empty list.
- The variable `i` remains the first element in the list `a`.
- The string `ts` now contains the reversed binary string representation of `i` followed by two '0's.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers read from input where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 2^{30}-1\) and `a` must have at least one element, `s` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `ts` is the reversed binary string representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix, followed by the characters '00'.**
