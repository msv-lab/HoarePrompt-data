The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_5`, which is expected to return an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `func_1` is called exactly once. If `func_5` returns 0, `func_1` is not called at all. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `func_1` has been called `n` times, where `n` is the integer returned by `func_5`. If `func_5` returns a non-integer or a negative integer, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error.
