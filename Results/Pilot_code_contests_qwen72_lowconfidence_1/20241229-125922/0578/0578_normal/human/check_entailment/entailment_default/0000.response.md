Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case as described in the problem statement:

1. **Handling of Character Groups in `func_1`:** The function `func_1` processes the string `t` to determine if it can be transformed into a valid form based on the frequency of characters in `s`. However, it only considers groups of consecutive identical characters in `t` and does not account for the possibility of converting `s` to `t` using the allowed operations (swaps and increments).

2. **Increment Operation Logic:** The function does not correctly handle the increment operation. According to the problem, Ashish can increment a block of `k` consecutive characters in `s` if they are all the same and not equal to 'z'. The current implementation only checks if the frequency of characters in `s` can support the transformation, but it does not simulate the actual increment operation. This means it might incorrectly conclude that a transformation is possible when it is not.

3. **Swap Operation Logic:** The function does not consider the swap operation at all. The problem allows swapping adjacent characters in `s`, which can significantly change the order of characters and potentially make the transformation possible. The current implementation only checks for character frequencies and does not account for the possibility of reordering characters through swaps.

4. **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases where the transformation is impossible due to the constraints of the operations. For example, if `s` contains a character that is not present in `t` or if the required transformations exceed the allowed operations, the function might incorrectly output "Yes".

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
