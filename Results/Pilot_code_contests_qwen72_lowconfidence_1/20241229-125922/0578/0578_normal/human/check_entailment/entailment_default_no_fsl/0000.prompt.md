You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads three inputs: two integers `n` and `k`, and two strings `s` and `t`. It then processes `t` to determine if it can be transformed into a valid form based on the frequency of characters in `s`. Specifically, for each group of consecutive identical characters in `t`, the function checks if the remaining characters in `s` can satisfy the transformation requirements. If any group cannot be transformed, the function outputs "No" and returns immediately. If all groups can be transformed, the function outputs "Yes". The function modifies the `freq` dictionary, which tracks the frequency of characters in `s`, by reducing the counts based on the transformation rules. The function does not return any value explicitly; it only outputs "Yes" or "No" through the `func_3` function. Edge cases include scenarios where `t` contains groups of characters that exceed the available frequency in `s` or where `t` has groups of characters that cannot be divided evenly according to the rules.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(func_5())):
        func_1()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It calls `func_5`, which is expected to return an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `func_1` is called exactly once. If `func_5` returns 0, `func_1` is not called at all. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `func_1` has been called `n` times, where `n` is the integer returned by `func_5`. If `func_5` returns a non-integer or a negative integer, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(*args, **kwargs):
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` prints the elements of the `args` tuple to the specified `file` object, separating them by the `sep` string (defaulting to a single space), and appends the `end` string (defaulting to a newline) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the output buffer of the `file` is flushed. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` as they are used. The `args` tuple remains unchanged. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the `file` except the `end` string.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the variable `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative numbers and zero, correctly computing the GCD in all cases.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters (both `\r` and `\n`), and returns the resulting string. If the input line is empty or contains only newline characters, the function will return an empty string.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
