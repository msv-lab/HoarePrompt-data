Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not fully account for the transformations required to convert string `a` into string `b`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling of Swaps and Increments:**
   - The problem allows for two types of operations: swapping adjacent characters and incrementing a substring of length `k` by one character. However, the current implementation only focuses on the frequency of characters and does not consider the possibility of using swaps to rearrange characters.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4 2
     abcd
     dcba
     ```
     Here, the string `abcd` can be converted to `dcba` by a series of swaps, but the current implementation would incorrectly determine that it is not possible because it does not account for the swaps.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the transformation requires a combination of swaps and increments. For instance, if the input is:
     ```
     6 2
     aabbaa
     ccddcc
     ```
     The string `aabbaa` can be transformed to `ccddcc` by a series of swaps and increments, but the current implementation would fail to recognize this.

3. **Character Frequency Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a frequency counter to check if the characters in `t` can be formed from `s`. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the characters in `t` require multiple increments or swaps to match the characters in `s`.
   - For example, if the input is:
     ```
     4 2
     aabb
     cccc
     ```
     The string `aabb` can be transformed to `cccc` by incrementing the substrings, but the current implementation would incorrectly determine that it is not possible.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
