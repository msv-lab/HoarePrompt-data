The function `func_4` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the variable `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is set to 0. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative numbers and zero, correctly computing the GCD in all cases.
