The function `func_1` reads three inputs: two integers `n` and `k`, and two strings `s` and `t`. It then processes `t` to determine if it can be transformed into a valid form based on the frequency of characters in `s`. Specifically, for each group of consecutive identical characters in `t`, the function checks if the remaining characters in `s` can satisfy the transformation requirements. If any group cannot be transformed, the function outputs "No" and returns immediately. If all groups can be transformed, the function outputs "Yes". The function modifies the `freq` dictionary, which tracks the frequency of characters in `s`, by reducing the counts based on the transformation rules. The function does not return any value explicitly; it only outputs "Yes" or "No" through the `func_3` function. Edge cases include scenarios where `t` contains groups of characters that exceed the available frequency in `s` or where `t` has groups of characters that cannot be divided evenly according to the rules.
