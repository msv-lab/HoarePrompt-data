The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, since this is part of a loop context, the state of the program before the `continue` statement is preserved, except for the fact that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Given the initial state and the presence of the `continue` statement, the output state is:

- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `groups` must have at least two elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`.
- `group` is the second element of `groups`.

Since the `continue` statement only affects the flow of the loop and does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`.**
