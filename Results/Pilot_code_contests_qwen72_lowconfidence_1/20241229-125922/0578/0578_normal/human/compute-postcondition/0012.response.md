The code snippet sets `at_start` to `False`. This operation changes the value of `at_start` from its initial state (which was also `False`) to `False`. Since this is a redundant assignment, the value of `at_start` remains `False`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple with at least one more element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value associated with the 'sep' key in `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value associated with the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, the string representation of the next `x` has been written to `file` after the value of `sep`.**
