Functionality: ** The function `func_3` prints the elements of the `args` tuple to the specified `file` object, separating them by the `sep` string (defaulting to a single space), and appends the `end` string (defaulting to a newline) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the output buffer of the `file` is flushed. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` as they are used. The `args` tuple remains unchanged. If `args` is empty, nothing is written to the `file` except the `end` string. **
