Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the function returns `None`. If `div` is 0, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `groups`, `div`, `rem`, `group`, and `freq[group[0]]` remain unchanged.***
