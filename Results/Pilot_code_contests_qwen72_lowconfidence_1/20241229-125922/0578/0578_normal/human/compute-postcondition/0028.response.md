Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers read from the output of `func_5()`, `s` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `t` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `groups` is a list of groups of consecutive characters from `t` and must have at least one element, `group` is the first element of `groups`, `div` is `len(groups[0]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[0]) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 1, `div` is greater than 0, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is updated to `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
