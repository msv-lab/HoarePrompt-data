To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `groups` must have at least two elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`.
- `group` is the second element of `groups`.
- If `div` == 0, the same conditions apply as no additional changes occur.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range generated by `range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1)` is non-empty.
2. **Range Parameters**:
   - `start`: `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`
   - `stop`: `-1` (exclusive)
   - `step`: `-1`

For the loop to execute, `start` must be greater than or equal to `stop` (which is `-1`).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Condition**:
   - `group` is the second element of `groups`.
   - `group[0]` is the first character of the string in `group`.

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` gives the index of `group[0]` in the alphabet.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` should be greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1 >= -1`
   - Simplifying, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) >= 0`

Since `group[0]` is a character from the alphabet, its index is always between 0 and 25. Therefore, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is always non-negative.

### Adjusted State:
The loop will execute as long as `group[0]` is a valid character from the alphabet (which it is, since it comes from `group` which is an element of `groups`).

Thus, the state does not need to be adjusted further beyond ensuring that `group[0]` is a valid character and `groups` has at least two elements.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`**
