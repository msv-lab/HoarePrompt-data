Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except for the following updates: `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - (len(groups[1]) % k)`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - (len(groups[1]) // k)`, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
