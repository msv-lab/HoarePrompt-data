The function `func_3('No')` is called. Since the content of the function `func_3` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program state. However, based on the information given, we can assume that this function does not alter any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`**.
