To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `groups` must have at least two elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`.
- `group` is the second element of `groups`.
- If the loop finds a character `string.ascii_lowercase[i]` such that `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] >= div`, then:
  - `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
  - `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`.
- If no such character is found, `func_3('No')` is called and the loop returns.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for group in groups:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `groups` to iterate over.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - After the previous iteration, `group` was the second element of `groups`.
   - For the next iteration, `group` will be the third element of `groups`.
   - The number of elements in `groups` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

3. **Frequency Adjustments**:
   - The frequency adjustments (`freq[group[0]]` and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]`) depend on the specific logic within the loop body. However, these adjustments do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Updated State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `groups` must have at least three elements.
- `div` is still `len(groups[1]) // k` (since `groups[1]` is the same).
- `rem` is still `len(groups[1]) % k` (since `groups[1]` is the same).
- `group` is the third element of `groups`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`**.
