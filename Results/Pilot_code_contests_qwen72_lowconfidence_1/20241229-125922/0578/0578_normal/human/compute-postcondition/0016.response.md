The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file specified by `file`. This action appends the string to the content of `file`.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a non-empty tuple with at least one more element.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain keys 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is the value associated with the 'sep' key in `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is the value associated with the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- The string representation of the next `x` has been written to `file` after the value of `sep`.
- If `not at_start`, `file` contains an additional `sep` value.

After executing the code, the string representation of `x` is appended to `file`. Since `at_start` is `False`, `file` already contains the string representation of the previous `x` followed by `sep`. After this operation, `file` will contain the string representation of the previous `x`, followed by `sep`, and then the string representation of the current `x`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `args` is a non-empty tuple with at least one more element.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain keys 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is the value associated with the 'sep' key in `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is the value associated with the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `False`.
- The string representation of the next `x` has been written to `file` after the value of `sep`.
- `file` contains the string representation of the previous `x`, followed by `sep`, and then the string representation of the current `x`.

Output State: **`args` is a non-empty tuple with at least one more element, `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain keys 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value associated with the 'sep' key in `kwargs` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value associated with the 'file' key in `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, the string representation of the next `x` has been written to `file` after the value of `sep`, `file` contains the string representation of the previous `x`, followed by `sep`, and then the string representation of the current `x`.**
