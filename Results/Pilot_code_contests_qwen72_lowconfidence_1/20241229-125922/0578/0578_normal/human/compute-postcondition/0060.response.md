The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. It does not affect the values of variables but skips the remaining part of the loop body.

Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `groups`, `div`, `rem`, `group`, and `freq[group[0]]` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that it would skip any further code in the loop body for the current iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the function returns `None`.**
