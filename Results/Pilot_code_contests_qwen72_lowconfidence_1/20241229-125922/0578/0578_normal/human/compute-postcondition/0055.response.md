`rem` is assigned the value of the length of `group` modulo `k`. Given that `group` is the third element of `groups`, `rem` is now `len(groups[2]) % k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`**.
