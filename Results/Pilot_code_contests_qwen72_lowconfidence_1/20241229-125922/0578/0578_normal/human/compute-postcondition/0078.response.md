The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context and the output cases, it seems to operate with parameters `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `groups`. Here's the breakdown:

- **Parameters**: 
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
  - `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
  - `s`: A string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
  - `t`: A string of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.
  - `groups`: A list of groups, where each group is a list or similar data structure.

- **Return Values**:
  - **Case_1**: The program returns nothing as there is no expression or variable specified in the return statement.
  - **Case_2**: The program returns nothing explicitly. However, internal variables are updated: `div` is set to `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is set to `len(groups[1]) % k`, and `group` is set to the second element of `groups`.
  - **Case_3**: The program returns `None`. The parameters `n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged. `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is set to `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is set to `len(groups[2]) % k`, and `group` is set to the third element of `groups`.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, and `groups`. In Case_1, it returns nothing. In Case_2, it updates internal variables `div`, `rem`, and `group` based on the second element of `groups`. In Case_3, it returns `None` and updates internal variables `div`, `rem`, and `group` based on the third element of `groups`, while keeping `n`, `k`, `s`, and `t` unchanged.**
