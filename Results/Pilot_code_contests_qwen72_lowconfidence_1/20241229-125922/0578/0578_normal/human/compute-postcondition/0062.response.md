To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `groups` must have at least three elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`.
- `group` is the third element of `groups`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the function returns `None`.
- If `div` is 0, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and the values of `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `groups`, `div`, `rem`, `group`, and `freq[group[0]]` remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over a range starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `group[0]` must be a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` returns the index of `group[0]` in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
   - The loop will start at `index(group[0]) - 1` and stop at -1 (exclusive).

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
- The loop will execute if `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
- This means `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z' (since 'a' has an index of 0, and `index('a') - 1` would be -1, which would not enter the loop).
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `groups`, `div`, `rem`, `group`, and `freq[group[0]]`) should remain as described in the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z', `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`**
