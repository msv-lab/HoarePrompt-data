The values of `x` and `y` are swapped such that the new value of `x` is the original value of `y`, and the new value of `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`. Since `y` must be non-zero, the operation `x % y` is valid.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is the original value of `y`
- `y` is the original value of `x % y`

After executing the code snippet:
- The new value of `x` is the original value of `y`
- The new value of `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`

Therefore, the Output State is: **`x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`**.
