The code snippet `func_3('Yes')` calls a function named `func_3` with the argument `'Yes'`. However, without the definition of `func_3`, we cannot determine its side effects or return value. Therefore, we assume that `func_3` does not modify any global variables and does not return a value that affects the state.

Given this, the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `t`, `freq`, and `groups` remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the output of `func_5()`, `s` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `t` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with the specified modifications, `groups` is a list of groups of consecutive characters from `t`.**
