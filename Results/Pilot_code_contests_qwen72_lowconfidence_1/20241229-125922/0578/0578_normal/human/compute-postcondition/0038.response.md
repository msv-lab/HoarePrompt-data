Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`. If `div` == 0, the same conditions apply as no additional changes occur.***
