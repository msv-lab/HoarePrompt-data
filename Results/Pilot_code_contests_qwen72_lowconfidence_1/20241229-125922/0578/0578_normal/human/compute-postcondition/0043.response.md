Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is updated to `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.***
