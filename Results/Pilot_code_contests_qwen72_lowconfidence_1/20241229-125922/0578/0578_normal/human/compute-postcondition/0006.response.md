To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and its effect on the variables `x` and `y`.

### Initial State:
- `x` and `y` are integers.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while y:
    x, y = y, x % y
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `x` becomes the original value of `y`.
   - `y` becomes the original value of `x % y`.
   - For the loop to execute, `y` must be non-zero.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `x` becomes the value of `y` from the first iteration (which is the original `x % y`).
   - `y` becomes the value of `x % y` from the first iteration (which is the original `y % (x % y)`).
   - For the loop to execute again, the new `y` must be non-zero.

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues to swap `x` and `y` and compute `x % y` until `y` becomes zero.
   - Each iteration reduces `y` by setting it to the remainder of the previous `x` divided by the previous `y`.

### Final State:
- The loop terminates when `y` becomes zero.
- At this point, `x` holds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.
- `y` is zero.

### Output State:
**`x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, `y` is 0.**
