Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z', `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`. If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration or statement.***
