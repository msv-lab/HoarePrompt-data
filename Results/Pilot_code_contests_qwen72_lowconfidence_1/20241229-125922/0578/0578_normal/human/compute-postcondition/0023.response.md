The function `func_3` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function accepts `*args` and `**kwargs`. The `args` parameter is a tuple of any type and value, and `kwargs` is a dictionary that may contain the keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'`. The default values for these keys are `' '` (a single space) for `'sep'`, `sys.stdout` for `'file'`, `'\n'` (a newline) for `'end'`, and `False` for `'flush'`.

Since no specific output or return value is mentioned in the problem statement, it is assumed that the function does not return a value but rather performs some operation based on the provided parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts `*args` (a tuple of any type and value) and `**kwargs` (a dictionary that may contain keys `'sep'`, `'file'`, `'end'`, and `'flush'` with default values of `' '`, `sys.stdout`, `'\n'`, and `False`, respectively). It does not return a value but performs an operation based on the provided parameters.**
