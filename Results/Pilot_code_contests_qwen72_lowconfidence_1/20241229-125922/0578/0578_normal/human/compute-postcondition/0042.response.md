The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. It does not alter the values of any variables but affects the flow control. Given that no variables are modified by this statement, the only change is in the control flow.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged except `freq[group[0]]` which is now `freq[group[0]] - rem` and `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` which is now `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is the second element of `groups`, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
