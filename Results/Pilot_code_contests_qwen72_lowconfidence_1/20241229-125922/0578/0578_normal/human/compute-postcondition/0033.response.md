The function call `func_3('No')` does not affect the state of the variables mentioned in the initial state because no information about the function `func_3` or its side effects is provided. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is now `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is now `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is now the second element of `groups`.**
