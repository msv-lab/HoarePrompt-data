To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the output of `func_5()`.
- `s` is the output of `func_5()` (a string).
- `t` is the output of `func_5()` (a string).
- `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`.
- `groups` is a list of groups of consecutive characters from `t` and must have at least one element.
- `group` is the first element of `groups`.
- `div` is `len(groups[0]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[0]) % k`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 1.
- `div` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` and decreases until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to match the next value in the range.
   - The next value in the range is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be updated to `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the output of `func_5()`, `s` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `t` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `groups` is a list of groups of consecutive characters from `t` and must have at least one element, `group` is the first element of `groups`, `div` is `len(groups[0]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[0]) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 1, `div` is greater than 0, and `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.**
