The code snippet `x, y = y, x % y` performs a simultaneous assignment, updating the values of `x` and `y` based on their current values.

- Initially, `x` holds the original value of `y`.
- Initially, `y` holds the original value of `x % y`.

After executing the code:
- `x` is updated to the original value of `y`.
- `y` is updated to the original value of `x % y`.

Since the initial conditions already match the final assignments, the values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were initially described. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the original value of `x % y`, and `y` must be non-zero**
