The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. Since no loops or conditions are explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement would only have an effect if it were part of a larger context not shown here. Given the information, the variables and their values remain unchanged except for the fact that the program flow is affected by breaking out of the current structure.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the output of `func_5()`, `s` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `t` is the output of `func_5()` (a string), `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `groups` is a list of groups of consecutive characters from `t` and must have at least one element, `group` is the first element of `groups`, `div` is `len(groups[0]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[0]) % k`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0])` is at least 1, `div` is greater than 0, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
