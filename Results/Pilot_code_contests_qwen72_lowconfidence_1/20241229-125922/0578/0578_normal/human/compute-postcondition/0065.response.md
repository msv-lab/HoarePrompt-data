Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z', `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`, `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]] - div`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
