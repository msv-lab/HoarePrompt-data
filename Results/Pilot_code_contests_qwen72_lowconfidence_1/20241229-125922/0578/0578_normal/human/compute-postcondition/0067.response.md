To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `groups` must have at least three elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`.
- `group` is the third element of `groups`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z'.
- `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.
- If `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is greater than or equal to `div`, then `freq[string.ascii_lowercase[i]]` is decremented by `div`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1` down to 0 (inclusive).
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Decrement `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

### Updated State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `groups` must have at least three elements.
- `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`.
- `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`.
- `group` is the third element of `groups`.
- `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`.
- `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z'.
- `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least three elements, `div` is `len(groups[2]) // k`, `rem` is `len(groups[2]) % k`, `group` is the third element of `groups`, `freq[group[0]]` is `freq[group[0]] - rem`, `group[0]` must be a character from 'b' to 'z', `i` is `string.ascii_lowercase.index(group[0]) - 2`.**
