Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged, `groups` must have at least two elements, `div` is now `len(groups[1]) // k`, `rem` is now `len(groups[1]) % k`, `group` is now the second element of `groups`. If `freq[group[0]] < rem`, the program returns nothing explicitly, but `div` and `rem` are updated as described, and `group` is the second element of `groups`.***
