You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Ashish has two strings a and b, each of length n, and an integer k. The strings only contain lowercase English letters.

He wants to convert string a into string b by performing some (possibly zero) operations on a.

In one move, he can either 

  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i≤ n-1) and swap a_i and a_{i+1}, or 
  * choose an index i (1 ≤ i ≤ n-k+1) and if a_i, a_{i+1}, …, a_{i+k-1} are all equal to some character c (c ≠ 'z'), replace each one with the next character (c+1), that is, 'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. 



Note that he can perform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on string a. 

Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string a into b after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n).

The second line of each test case contains the string a of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

The third line of each test case contains the string b of length n consisting of lowercase English letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n among all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Output

For each test case, print "Yes" if Ashish can convert a into b after some moves, else print "No".

You may print the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


4
3 3
abc
bcd
4 2
abba
azza
2 1
zz
aa
6 2
aaabba
ddddcc


Output


No
Yes
No
Yes

Note

In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert a into b.

In the second test case,

"abba" \xrightarrow{inc} "acca" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "azza".

Here "swap" denotes an operation of the first type, and "inc" denotes an operation of the second type.

In the fourth test case,

"aaabba" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaabab" \xrightarrow{swap} "aaaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddaabb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddbb" \xrightarrow{inc} … \xrightarrow{inc} "ddddcc".
Program:
```
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
