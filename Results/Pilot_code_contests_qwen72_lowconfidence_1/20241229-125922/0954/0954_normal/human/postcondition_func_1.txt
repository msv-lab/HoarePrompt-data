The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values) and will raise a `ValueError` if the input contains non-integer substrings. Additionally, the function does not consume or process any further input beyond the first line. After the function executes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
