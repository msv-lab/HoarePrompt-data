#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting the input string, which is split by spaces, into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers converted from the input string, where the input string is expected to contain integers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values) and will raise a `ValueError` if the input contains non-integer substrings. Additionally, the function does not consume or process any further input beyond the first line. After the function executes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`.
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :

        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, and `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`. Additionally, `first` is less than or equal to `second`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the state remains unchanged. If `second` is not greater than `first`, 'EQUAL' is printed.

If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' has been printed. If `first` is less than or equal to `second`, and `second` is greater than `first`, the state remains unchanged. If `second` is not greater than `first`, 'EQUAL' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads three inputs: `a` (a positive integer), `b` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit), and `c` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit). It then compares the digits at corresponding positions in `b` and `c` to count how many times the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and how many times the digit in `c` is greater than the digit in `b` (`second`). After the comparison, the function prints one of the following strings based on the counts: 'RED' if `first` is greater than `second`, 'BLUE' if `second` is greater than `first`, or 'EQUAL' if `first` and `second` are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` and `c` are not of the same length as `a`, which would cause an index out of range error, and cases where `a` is not a positive integer, which would lead to invalid input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, so there is no precondition to specify.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The user input must be a non-negative integer. If the user input is 0, the loop does not execute, and `func_3()` is not called. If the user input is a positive integer `n`, the loop executes `n` times, and `func_3()` is called `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, which must be a non-negative integer. If the input is 0, the function does nothing further. If the input is a positive integer `n`, the function calls `func_3()` exactly `n` times. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the state of the program depends on the side effects of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` modifies any global variables or performs any I/O operations, those changes will persist. If the user inputs a negative integer or a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error.
