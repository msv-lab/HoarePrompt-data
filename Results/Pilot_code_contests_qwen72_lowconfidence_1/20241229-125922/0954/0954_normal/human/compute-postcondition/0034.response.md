Functionality: ** The function `func_3` reads three inputs: `a` (a positive integer), `b` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit), and `c` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit). It then compares the digits at corresponding positions in `b` and `c` to count how many times the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and how many times the digit in `c` is greater than the digit in `b` (`second`). After the comparison, the function prints one of the following strings based on the counts: 'RED' if `first` is greater than `second`, 'BLUE' if `second` is greater than `first`, or 'EQUAL' if `first` and `second` are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` and `c` are not of the same length as `a`, which would cause an index out of range error, and cases where `a` is not a positive integer, which would lead to invalid input. **
