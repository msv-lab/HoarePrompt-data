Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, and `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`. If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' has been printed. If `first` is less than or equal to `second`, and `second` is greater than `first`, the state remains unchanged. If `second` is not greater than `first`, 'EQUAL' is printed.***
