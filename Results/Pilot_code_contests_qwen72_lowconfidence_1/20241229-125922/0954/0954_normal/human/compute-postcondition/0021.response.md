Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `b` and `c` are the same strings as before, `i` is 2. If the integer value of `b[1]` is less than the integer value of `c[1]`, then `first` is 0 and `second` is 3. If the integer value of `b[1]` is greater than the integer value of `c[1]`, then `first` is 2 and `second` is 1. Otherwise, `first` is 1 and `second` is 2.***
