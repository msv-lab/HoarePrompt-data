To provide an accurate output state, additional details about the function `func_3()` are required. However, based on the given information:

- The user input must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.
- The loop has already executed once.

Without knowing what `func_3()` does, we can only assume that calling this function does not change the initial state conditions unless explicitly defined in the function's implementation. Since no changes are specified, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **The user input must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and the loop has already executed once.**
