To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: The user input must be a positive integer.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **User Input**: The loop runs based on the value of `int(input())`, which is the number of times the loop will iterate.
2. **Iteration Variable `_`**: The underscore `_` is a common convention in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the range value is greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, the user input was a positive integer, say `k`.
- The loop has already executed once, so the remaining iterations are `k - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the remaining iterations must still be greater than 0.

### Adjusted State:
- The user input must be a positive integer, and since one iteration has already completed, the remaining iterations are `k - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `k` must be at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **The user input must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and the loop has already executed once.**
