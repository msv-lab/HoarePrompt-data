Functionality: ** The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, which must be a non-negative integer. If the input is 0, the function does nothing further. If the input is a positive integer `n`, the function calls `func_3()` exactly `n` times. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the state of the program depends on the side effects of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` modifies any global variables or performs any I/O operations, those changes will persist. If the user inputs a negative integer or a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error. **
