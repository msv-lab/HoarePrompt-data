Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `b` and `c` are strings input from the user, `i` is 0. If the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]`, then `first` is 1 and `second` is 0. If the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]`, then `first` is 0 and `second` is 1. Otherwise, `first` and `second` remain 0.***
