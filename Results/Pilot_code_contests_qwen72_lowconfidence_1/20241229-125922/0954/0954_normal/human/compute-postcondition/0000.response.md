To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Conversion**: The loop uses `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations. This means the user must provide an integer input.
2. **Range Function**: The `range` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) the provided integer.
3. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the provided integer is greater than 0. If the integer is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

### Initial State:
- There are no variables in the function signature being used, so there is no precondition to specify.
- The loop depends on the user input.

### Adjusted State:
- The user input must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

### Final State:
State: **The user input must be a positive integer**.
