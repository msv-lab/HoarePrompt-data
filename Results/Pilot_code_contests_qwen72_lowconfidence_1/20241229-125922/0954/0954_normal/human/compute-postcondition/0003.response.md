The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_3()`. Since there is no information about the definition of `func_3()` or what it does, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, we can assume that calling this function does not inherently change the known preconditions unless specified otherwise.

Given the initial state:
- The user input must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
- The loop has already executed once.

Since the call to `func_3()` does not modify these conditions, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state in terms of the user input and the loop's status.

Output State: **The user input must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and the loop has already executed once.**
