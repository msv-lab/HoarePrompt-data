The function `func_3` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. `a` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `b` and `c` are strings of length `a`, where each character is a digit ('0'-'9'). The function returns a result based on these parameters.

Since the output section is not provided, I cannot determine the specific return values or cases. However, based on the given parameters, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `a` (a positive integer), `b` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit), and `c` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit). The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
