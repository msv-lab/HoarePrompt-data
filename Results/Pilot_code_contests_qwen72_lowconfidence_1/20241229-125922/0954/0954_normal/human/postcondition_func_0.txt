The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, an empty list is returned.
