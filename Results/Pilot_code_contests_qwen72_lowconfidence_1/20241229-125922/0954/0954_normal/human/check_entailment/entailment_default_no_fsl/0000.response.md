Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function compares the digits at corresponding positions in the strings `b` and `c` to count how many times the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` and vice versa. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the actual numbers formed by the digits when the cards are permuted. The problem requires determining the probability that the number formed by the red digits (`R`) is greater than the number formed by the blue digits (`B`) across all permutations of the cards.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
123
321
```
The function `func_3` will incorrectly compare the digits position by position:
- For the first position: `1 < 3` (Blue)
- For the second position: `2 < 2` (Neither)
- For the third position: `3 > 1` (Red)

This results in a tie (1 Red, 1 Blue), and the function will print "EQUAL". However, the correct answer should be "RED" because there are more permutations where `R > B` than where `R < B`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to generate all permutations of the cards and count the number of times `R > B` and `R < B`. This is a more complex task and cannot be achieved by simply comparing the digits at corresponding positions. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.
