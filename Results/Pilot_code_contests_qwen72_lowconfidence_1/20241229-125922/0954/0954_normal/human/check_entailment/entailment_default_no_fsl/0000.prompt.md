You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.
Functions with output description for each function:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, an empty list is returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values) and will raise a `ValueError` if the input contains non-integer substrings. Additionally, the function does not consume or process any further input beyond the first line. After the function executes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
    if first > second:
        print('RED')
    elif second > first:
        print('BLUE')
    else:
        print('EQUAL')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads three inputs: `a` (a positive integer), `b` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit), and `c` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit). It then compares the digits at corresponding positions in `b` and `c` to count how many times the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and how many times the digit in `c` is greater than the digit in `b` (`second`). After the comparison, the function prints one of the following strings based on the counts: 'RED' if `first` is greater than `second`, 'BLUE' if `second` is greater than `first`, or 'EQUAL' if `first` and `second` are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` and `c` are not of the same length as `a`, which would cause an index out of range error, and cases where `a` is not a positive integer, which would lead to invalid input.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, which must be a non-negative integer. If the input is 0, the function does nothing further. If the input is a positive integer `n`, the function calls `func_3()` exactly `n` times. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the state of the program depends on the side effects of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` modifies any global variables or performs any I/O operations, those changes will persist. If the user inputs a negative integer or a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
