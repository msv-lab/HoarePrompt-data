You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n cards numbered 1, …, n. The card i has a red digit r_i and a blue digit b_i written on it.

We arrange all n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of 1, …, n having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer R. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer B. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to 0. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how R and B can be found.

<image>

Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle R > B, and Blue bets that R < B. If in the end R = B, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.

Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of test cases.

Descriptions of T test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of cards.

The following line contains a string of n digits r_1, …, r_n — red digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

The following line contains a string of n digits b_1, …, b_n — blue digits on cards 1, …, n respectively.

Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.

Output

Print T answers for the test cases in order, one per line.

If Red has a strictly higher change to win, print "RED".

If Blue has a strictly higher change to win, print "BLUE".

If both players are equally likely to win, print "EQUAL".

Note that all answers are case-sensitive.

Example

Input


3
3
777
111
3
314
159
5
09281
09281


Output


RED
BLUE
EQUAL

Note

Formally, let n_R be the number of permutations of cards 1, …, n such that the resulting numbers R and B satisfy R > B. Similarly, let n_B be the number of permutations such that R < B. If n_R > n_B, you should print "RED". If n_R < n_B, you should print "BLUE". If n_R = n_B, print "EQUAL".

In the first sample case, R = 777 and B = 111 regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.

In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:

  * order 1, 2, 3: 314 > 159;
  * order 1, 3, 2: 341 > 195;
  * order 2, 1, 3: 134 < 519;
  * order 2, 3, 1: 143 < 591;
  * order 3, 1, 2: 431 < 915;
  * order 3, 2, 1: 413 < 951.



Since R < B is more frequent, the answer is "BLUE".

In the third sample case, R = B regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program compares the digits of the red and blue sequences directly, without considering the permutations of the cards. This approach fails to account for the different possible values of \(R\) and \(B\) that could result from different permutations of the cards.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3
123
321
```

According to the problem description, we need to consider all permutations of the cards and determine the likelihood of \(R > B\), \(R < B\), or \(R = B\).

- Permutations of the cards:
  - [1, 2, 3]: \(R = 123\), \(B = 321\) → \(R < B\)
  - [1, 3, 2]: \(R = 132\), \(B = 312\) → \(R < B\)
  - [2, 1, 3]: \(R = 213\), \(B = 231\) → \(R > B\)
  - [2, 3, 1]: \(R = 231\), \(B = 213\) → \(R > B\)
  - [3, 1, 2]: \(R = 312\), \(B = 132\) → \(R > B\)
  - [3, 2, 1]: \(R = 321\), \(B = 123\) → \(R > B\)

In this case, \(R > B\) in 4 out of 6 permutations, and \(R < B\) in 2 out of 6 permutations. Therefore, Red is more likely to win, and the correct output should be "RED".

However, the provided program will output "BLUE" because it only compares the digits directly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
from __future__ import division, print_function
import sys, math, bisect, itertools

input = lambda : sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting the input string, which is split by spaces, into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input is empty or contains only whitespace, an empty list is returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers converted from the input string, where the input string is expected to contain integers separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line of input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces. It converts each substring into an integer and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer values) and will raise a `ValueError` if the input contains non-integer substrings. Additionally, the function does not consume or process any further input beyond the first line. After the function executes, the returned map object can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer representing the number of cards, b and c are strings of length a, where each character is a digit ('0'-'9').
def func_3():
    a = int(input())
    b = input()
    c = input()
    first = 0
    second = 0
    for i in range(a):
        if int(b[i]) > int(c[i]):
            first += 1
        elif int(b[i]) < int(c[i]):
            second += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`.
    if (first > second) :
        print('RED')
    else :
        if (second > first) :
            print('BLUE')
        else :
            print('EQUAL')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, and `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`. Additionally, `first` is less than or equal to `second`. If `second` is greater than `first`, the state remains unchanged. If `second` is not greater than `first`, 'EQUAL' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a positive integer, `b` and `c` are strings of length at least `a`, `first` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is greater than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`, and `second` is the count of positions where the integer value of `b[i]` is less than the integer value of `c[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, a-1]`. If `first` is greater than `second`, the string 'RED' has been printed. If `first` is less than or equal to `second`, and `second` is greater than `first`, the state remains unchanged. If `second` is not greater than `first`, 'EQUAL' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads three inputs: `a` (a positive integer), `b` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit), and `c` (a string of length `a` where each character is a digit). It then compares the digits at corresponding positions in `b` and `c` to count how many times the digit in `b` is greater than the digit in `c` (`first`) and how many times the digit in `c` is greater than the digit in `b` (`second`). After the comparison, the function prints one of the following strings based on the counts: 'RED' if `first` is greater than `second`, 'BLUE' if `second` is greater than `first`, or 'EQUAL' if `first` and `second` are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include scenarios where `b` and `c` are not of the same length as `a`, which would cause an index out of range error, and cases where `a` is not a positive integer, which would lead to invalid input.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, so there is no precondition to specify.
def func_4():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_3()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The user input must be a non-negative integer. If the user input is 0, the loop does not execute, and `func_3()` is not called. If the user input is a positive integer `n`, the loop executes `n` times, and `func_3()` is called `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, which must be a non-negative integer. If the input is 0, the function does nothing further. If the input is a positive integer `n`, the function calls `func_3()` exactly `n` times. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, the state of the program depends on the side effects of `func_3()`. If `func_3()` modifies any global variables or performs any I/O operations, those changes will persist. If the user inputs a negative integer or a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined and may result in a runtime error.
