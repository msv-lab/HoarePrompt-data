Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `d` from the standard input.
   - It also reads the list of platform lengths `c` and initializes an answer list `ans` of length `n` filled with zeros.

2. **Platform Placement Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial positions of the platforms from the rightmost to the leftmost. This is done by iterating over the platforms in reverse order and placing them as far to the right as possible without exceeding the river width `n`.

3. **Adjusting Platform Positions:**
   - The program then adjusts the positions of the platforms to ensure that the gap between consecutive platforms (or between the last platform and the right bank) is within the jump distance `d`.
   - If the gap is within the jump distance, the platform is placed accordingly, and the corresponding indices in the `ans` list are set to the platform index.
   - If the gap is too large, the program adjusts the position of the platform to the maximum allowed position within the jump distance.

4. **Final Check and Output:**
   - After placing all the platforms, the program checks if the final position of the last platform plus its length allows a jump to the right bank (`n + 1`).
   - If the gap between the last platform and the right bank is within the jump distance, the program prints "YES" followed by the `ans` list.
   - If the gap is too large, the program prints "NO".

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Platform Placement:** The program ensures that platforms are placed in a way that allows the player to jump from one platform to another or from a platform to the right bank, adhering to the jump distance constraint.
- **Gap Handling:** The program correctly handles the gaps between platforms and between the last platform and the right bank, ensuring that the player can always make the necessary jumps.
- **Output Format:** The program produces the correct output format, printing "YES" followed by the `ans` list if the solution is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Platform:** The program correctly handles cases where there is only one platform, ensuring that it can be placed to allow a jump to the right bank.
- **No Platforms:** The program correctly handles cases where there are no platforms, which is not possible given the constraints \(1 \leq m \leq n\).
- **Large Jump Distance:** The program correctly handles cases where the jump distance `d` is large enough to cover the entire river, ensuring that the player can always reach the right bank.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
