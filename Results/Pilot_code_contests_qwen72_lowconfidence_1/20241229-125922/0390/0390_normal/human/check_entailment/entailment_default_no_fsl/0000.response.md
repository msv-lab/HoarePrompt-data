Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly, specifically when the platforms cannot be placed in such a way that the distance constraint `d` is satisfied. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Case:
- Input:
  ```
  10 3 2
  1 3 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  0 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0
  ```

### Analysis:
In this case, the program incorrectly places the platforms such that the distance constraint `d` is not satisfied. Specifically, the program places the platforms as follows:
- Platform 1 (length 1) at position 4.
- Platform 2 (length 3) at positions 5, 6, 7.
- Platform 3 (length 1) at position 8.

However, the distance between the end of Platform 1 (position 4) and the start of Platform 2 (position 5) is only 1, which is less than or equal to `d = 2`, but the distance between the end of Platform 2 (position 7) and the start of Platform 3 (position 8) is also 1, which is less than or equal to `d = 2`. This placement is valid according to the program, but it does not ensure that the player can jump from Platform 2 to Platform 3, as the jump distance from position 7 to position 8 is only 1, which is not sufficient to cover the required distance of 2.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly determine that it is impossible to place the platforms in a way that satisfies the distance constraint `d` for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
