Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
10 2 3
2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
0 0 1 1 0 2 2 2 0 0
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" instead of finding a valid configuration for the platforms and jumps. The issue lies in the way the positions of the platforms are being adjusted and checked. Specifically, the condition `if n + 1 - (pos[-1] + c[-1] - 1) > d:` might be too restrictive, leading to incorrect "NO" results in certain cases. This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
