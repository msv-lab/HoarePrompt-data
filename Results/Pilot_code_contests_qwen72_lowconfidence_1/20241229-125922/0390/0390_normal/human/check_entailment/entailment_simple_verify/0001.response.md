Final: **True**

Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `d` and the lengths of the platforms `c`.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with zeros, which will store the platform indices.

2. **Platform Placement**:
   - The program places the platforms starting from the rightmost position (`n + 1`) and moving leftwards.
   - It ensures that the platforms do not intersect and maintains the required gap (`d`) between them.
   - The annotations confirm that `pos` is a list containing the starting positions of each platform, and `su` is the sum of the lengths of the platforms.

3. **Adjusting Platform Positions**:
   - If the gap between the current platform and the next platform is greater than `d`, the program adjusts the position of the current platform to ensure the gap is exactly `d`.
   - This ensures that it is always possible to jump from one platform to the next within the allowed distance `d`.
   - The annotations show that `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n)` to maintain the gap, and the platform is placed accordingly.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After placing all platforms, the program checks if the last platform can reach the right bank (`n + 1`). If the gap is greater than `d`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the array `ans` indicating the positions of the platforms.
   - The annotations confirm that the final check is performed correctly, ensuring that the last platform can reach the right bank within the allowed jump distance `d`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the river width `n` is small, or when the maximum jump distance `d` is large enough to cover the entire river.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the sum of platform lengths is less than `n`.

Given the detailed annotations and the logical flow of the program, the original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, ensuring that the platforms are placed in a way that allows the player to jump from the left bank to the right bank within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
