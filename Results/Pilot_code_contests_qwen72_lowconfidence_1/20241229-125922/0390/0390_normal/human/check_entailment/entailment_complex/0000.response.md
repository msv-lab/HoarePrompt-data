Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the platforms can be placed in such a way that it is possible to jump from cell 0 to cell n+1 while adhering to the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `d` from the input.
   - It also reads the list `c` of platform lengths.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes an array `ans` of length `n` filled with zeros, which will be used to store the platform indices.
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store the starting positions of the platforms.

3. **Placing Platforms:**
   - The program iterates over the platform lengths in reverse order to determine their initial positions.
   - It calculates the starting position of each platform from the right side of the river, ensuring that the platforms do not overlap and are placed as far to the right as possible initially.

4. **Adjusting Platform Positions:**
   - The program reverses the `pos` list to start placing platforms from the left side.
   - For each platform, it checks if the gap between the current platform and the next platform is within the jump distance `d`.
   - If the gap is within the jump distance, it places the platform accordingly.
   - If the gap is too large, it adjusts the position of the current platform to ensure the gap is within the jump distance and places the platform.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After placing all the platforms, the program checks if the last platform can reach the right bank (cell n+1) within the jump distance `d`.
   - If it can, the program prints "YES" followed by the `ans` array.
   - If it cannot, the program prints "NO".

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Platform Placement:** The program ensures that platforms are placed in such a way that the gaps between them are within the jump distance `d`. This is done by adjusting the positions of the platforms as needed.
- **Jump Feasibility:** The final check ensures that it is possible to jump from the last platform to the right bank (cell n+1).
- **Output Format:** The output format matches the problem description. If it is possible to reach the right bank, the program prints "YES" followed by the `ans` array. If it is not possible, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Platform:** The program handles the case where there is only one platform and the jump distance `d` is large enough to cover the entire river.
- **Large Jump Distance:** The program correctly handles cases where the jump distance `d` is very large, allowing the player to jump over large gaps.
- **Small Jump Distance:** The program ensures that even with a small jump distance, the platforms are placed in such a way that the player can still reach the right bank if it is possible.

In conclusion, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
