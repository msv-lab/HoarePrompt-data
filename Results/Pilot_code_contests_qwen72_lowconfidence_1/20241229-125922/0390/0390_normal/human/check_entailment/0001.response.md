Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program seems to correctly handle the placement of platforms and the jumping logic according to the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the input values `n`, `m`, and `d` and the lengths of the platforms `c`.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with zeros, which will store the platform indices.

2. **Platform Placement**:
   - The program places the platforms starting from the rightmost position (`n + 1`) and moving leftwards.
   - It ensures that the platforms do not intersect and maintains the required gap (`d`) between them.

3. **Adjusting Platform Positions**:
   - If the gap between the current platform and the next platform is greater than `d`, the program adjusts the position of the current platform to ensure the gap is exactly `d`.
   - This ensures that it is always possible to jump from one platform to the next within the allowed distance `d`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After placing all platforms, the program checks if the last platform can reach the right bank (`n + 1`). If the gap is greater than `d`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the array `ans` indicating the positions of the platforms.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when the river width `n` is small, or when the maximum jump distance `d` is large enough to cover the entire river.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the sum of platform lengths is less than `n`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
