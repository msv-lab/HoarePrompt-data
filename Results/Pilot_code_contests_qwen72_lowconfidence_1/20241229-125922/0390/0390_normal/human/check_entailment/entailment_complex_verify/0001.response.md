### Analysis and Final Assessment

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to place platforms in a river such that you can jump from the left bank (cell 0) to the right bank (cell n+1) given certain constraints. The constraints include the width of the river `n`, the number of platforms `m`, the maximum jump distance `d`, and the lengths of the platforms `c`.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is correct. The explanation provided includes the following points:
1. Initialization and input reading.
2. Platform placement starting from the rightmost position.
3. Adjusting platform positions to ensure the gap is within the allowed distance `d`.
4. Final check to ensure the last platform can reach the right bank.
5. Handling edge cases.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
The annotated code provides a detailed state of the program at different points, which helps in verifying the correctness of the program's logic. Here are the key points from the annotations:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n`, `m`, and `d` and the lengths of the platforms `c`.
   - It initializes `ans` as a list of zeros of length `n`.

2. **Platform Placement**:
   - Platforms are placed starting from the rightmost position (`n + 1`) and moving leftwards.
   - The positions are stored in the list `pos`.

3. **Adjusting Platform Positions**:
   - If the gap between the current platform and the next platform is greater than `d`, the program adjusts the position of the current platform to ensure the gap is exactly `d`.
   - This ensures that it is always possible to jump from one platform to the next within the allowed distance `d`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After placing all platforms, the program checks if the last platform can reach the right bank (`n + 1`).
   - If the gap is greater than `d`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the array `ans` indicating the positions of the platforms.

#### Verification of Correctness
Based on the annotated code and the problem description, the program appears to correctly handle the placement of platforms and the jumping logic. The key steps and conditions are verified as follows:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input values and initializes the necessary variables.

2. **Platform Placement**:
   - The platforms are placed in a way that ensures they do not intersect and maintain the required gap (`d`).

3. **Adjusting Platform Positions**:
   - The program correctly adjusts the positions of the platforms to ensure the gap is within the allowed distance `d`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the last platform can reach the right bank and prints the appropriate result.

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. The annotated code supports the correctness of the program by providing detailed state information at different points.

### Final Assessment
Final: **True**
