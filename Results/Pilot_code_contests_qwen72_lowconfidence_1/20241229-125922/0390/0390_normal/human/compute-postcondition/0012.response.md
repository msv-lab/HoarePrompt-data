The value of `su` is updated by adding `c[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is `m - 3`, this means `su` is updated by adding `c[m - 3]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`
- `pos` is a list containing three elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`, `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`, and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2] - 2 * c[m - 3]`
- `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3] + c[m - 3]`
- `i` is `m - 3`

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing three elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`, `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`, and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2] - 2 * c[m - 3]`; `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + 2 * c[m - 3]`; `i` is `m - 3`.**
