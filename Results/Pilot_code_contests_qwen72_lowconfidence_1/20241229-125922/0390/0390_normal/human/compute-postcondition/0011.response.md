The given code appends a new element to the `pos` list. This element is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `su` is defined as `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`.
- `i` is defined as `m - 3`.

Therefore, the new element appended to `pos` is `n + 1 - (c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]) - c[m - 3]`, which simplifies to `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2] - 2 * c[m - 3]`.

The output state includes all the initial conditions that remain unchanged, plus the updated `pos` list.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing three elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`, `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`, and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2] - 2 * c[m - 3]`; `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`; `i` is `m - 3`.**
