Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1` for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are updated to `min(pos[i] + d, n) + c[i] - 1` for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m`.**
