The code snippet appends a new value to the list `pos`. This new value is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.

- `pos` initially contains one element, which is `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`.
- `su` is equal to `c[m - 1]`.
- `i` is `m - 2`.

Therefore, the new value appended to `pos` is `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`.

The updated `pos` list now contains two elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]` and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `pos` is a list containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]` and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`. `su` is `c[m - 1]`. `i` is `m - 2`.**
