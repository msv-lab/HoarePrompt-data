To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints \(1 \leq n, m, d \leq 1000\), \(m \leq n\), \(m > 0\).
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with specific elements set based on conditions involving `pos` and `c`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `pos[m]` is `min(pos[m - 1] + d, n)`.
- `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[m]`.
   - `c[i]` is `c[m - 1]`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The loop will execute one more time if the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` is valid.
   - This means `pos[i + 1]` must be within the bounds of the list `ans` and `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must not exceed the length of `ans`.

4. **Next Iteration Adjustments:**
   - The loop variable `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - The other states (`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `ans`, `pos`, `su`, `i`) remain unchanged except for the loop variable `j`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `ans`, `pos`, `su`, `i` are the same as before, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`**
