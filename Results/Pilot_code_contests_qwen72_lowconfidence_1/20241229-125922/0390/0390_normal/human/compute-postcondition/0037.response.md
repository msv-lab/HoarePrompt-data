To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the conditions required for the loop to run at least once are met. Let's break down the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.
- `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop will execute if `pos[i + 1]` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`. This means `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[m]` (since `i + 1 = m`).
   - `c[i]` is `c[m - 1]`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - `c[m - 1]` must be greater than 0.
   - `pos[m]` must be a valid index within the bounds of `ans`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to verify that `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0 and `pos[m]` is a valid starting index for the loop.

Given the constraints and the initial state:
- `c[m - 1]` is an integer between 1 and `n` (since `c` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and `n`).
- `pos[m]` is calculated as `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.

Since `c[m - 1]` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute if `pos[m]` is a valid index. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring the initial state is correct.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n); `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0**.
