The code initializes `c` to a list of integers read from input using `rints()`, which implies reading multiple integers separated by spaces. It also initializes `ans` to a list of zeros with length `n`.

- `c` is now a list of `m` integers, where each integer `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.**
