To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `j - 1` is `i + 1` and the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1` for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`.
- `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`.
- `c[i]` is greater than 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `j` must be within this range.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + 2`.

### Final State:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `j - 1` is `i + 1` and the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1` for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `pos[i + 1]` is `min(pos[i] + d, n)`, `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 2`, and `c[i]` is greater than 0.**
