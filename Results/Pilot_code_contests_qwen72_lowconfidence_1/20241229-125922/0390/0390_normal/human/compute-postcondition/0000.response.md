The function `rints` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits it by whitespace, and converts each split string into an integer, returning a list of these integers.

Since no actual call to `rints` is made in the provided code snippet, no changes occur to the variables `n`, `m`, `d`, or `c`. The only change is the definition of the function `rints`.

Therefore, the Output State remains mostly unchanged from the Initial State, except for the addition of the `rints` function.

Output State: **n, m, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, d ≤ 1000 and m ≤ n. c is a list of m integers where each c_i satisfies 1 ≤ c_i ≤ n and the sum of all c_i is less than or equal to n. `rints` is a function that reads a line from standard input, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of integers.**
