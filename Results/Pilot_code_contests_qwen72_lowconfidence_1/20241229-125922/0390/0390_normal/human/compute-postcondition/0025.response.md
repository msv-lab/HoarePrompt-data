The `continue` statement is used within loops (like `for` or `while` loops) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, in this context, since there is no enclosing loop mentioned, the `continue` statement would typically cause an error (specifically, a `SyntaxError` because `continue` outside a loop is not allowed). However, assuming this is part of a larger context where a loop is implied but not shown, the `continue` statement would simply skip the rest of the current iteration.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly. It only affects the flow of the program by skipping the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if one exists).

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m`.**
