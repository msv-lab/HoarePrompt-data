The value of `su` is incremented by the value of `c[i]`. Given that `i` is initialized to `m - 1`, this means `su` is incremented by the last element in the list `c`.

Therefore, the updated value of `su` is `c[m - 1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`. `m` must be greater than 0. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `pos` is a list containing one element `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`, `su` is `c[m - 1]`, `i` is `m - 1`.**
