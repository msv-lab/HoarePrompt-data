To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[j - 1]` set to `m`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.
- `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.
- `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0.
- `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `pos[i + 1] + 2`.
- **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Updated State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[j - 1]` set to `m`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n); `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0; `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 2`.**
