The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since this is a standalone `continue` statement outside of a loop, it would typically result in a syntax error. But assuming this is part of a loop context (which is not explicitly given), the `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables; it only affects the flow of the loop.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the loop behavior which is not represented in the state description.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements from index `pos[m] - 1` to `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 2` set to `m`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n).`**
