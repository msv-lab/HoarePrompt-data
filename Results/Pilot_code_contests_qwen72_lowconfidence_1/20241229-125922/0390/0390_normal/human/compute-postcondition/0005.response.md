The code snippet `pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])` appends the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]` to the list `pos`.

- `pos` is initially an empty list, so after this operation, `pos` will contain one element, which is `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.
- The value of `i` is `m - 1`, so `c[i]` refers to the last element in the list `c`.
- `su` is initially 0, so the value being appended is `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`. `m` must be greater than 0. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `pos` is a list containing one element `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`, `su` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`.**
