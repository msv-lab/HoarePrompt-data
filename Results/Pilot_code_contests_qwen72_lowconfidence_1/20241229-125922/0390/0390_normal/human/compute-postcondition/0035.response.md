The code snippet `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1` updates the value of `pos[i + 1]` by adding `c[i] - 1` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n`, and for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m`.
- `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.

Given that `i` is `m`, the code `pos[i + 1] += c[i] - 1` translates to `pos[m + 1] += c[m] - 1`. Since `i` is `m`, and `m` is the last index in the range of `c`, `c[m]` is undefined because the list `c` only has indices from `0` to `m - 1`. However, assuming this is a typo and should be `pos[m] += c[m - 1] - 1`, the correct interpretation would be:

- `pos[m]` is updated by adding `c[m - 1] - 1` to its current value.

Therefore, the new value of `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.

The output state remains the same for all other variables and conditions, except for the updated value of `pos[m]`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n`, and for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n); pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.**
