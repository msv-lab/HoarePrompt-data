Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
pos[i + 1] = min(pos[i] + d, n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Current Value of `i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is `m`. Therefore, `i` is `m`.
2. **Index Calculation**: The code snippet updates `pos[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `m`, `i + 1` is `m + 1`.
3. **Value Assignment**: The new value of `pos[m + 1]` is calculated as `min(pos[m] + d, n)`.
   - `pos[m]` is the last element in the `pos` list, which is `n + 1 - su - c[m-1]`.
   - Adding `d` to `pos[m]` gives `pos[m] + d`.
   - The `min` function ensures that the value does not exceed `n`.

### Updated State:
- `pos[m + 1]` is updated to `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.

### Output State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m`.
- `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`, the elements in `ans` from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`**.
