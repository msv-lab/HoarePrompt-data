To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints \(1 \leq n, m, d \leq 1000\), \(m \leq n\), \(m > 0\).
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each \(c_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq c_i \leq n\) and the sum of all \(c_i\) is less than or equal to \(n\).
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where the element at index \(j - 1\) is set to \(i + 1\).
- `pos` is a list containing \(m + 1\) elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are \(n + 1 - su - c[i]\) for \(i\) from \(0\) to \(m - 1\) in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is an integer in the range \([1, m-1]\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range \([pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])\).
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer in the range \([1, m-1]\).
   - `pos[i + 1]` is the starting position for the current iteration.
   - `c[i]` is the number of elements to process in this iteration.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- **Update `pos` and `c`**: The values of `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]` will change based on the new value of `i`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `i`**:
   - If `i` is currently \(k\), then for the next iteration, `i` will be \(k + 1\).
2. **Update `pos[i + 1]`**:
   - The new value of `pos[i + 1]` will be `pos[k + 2]`.
3. **Update `c[i]`**:
   - The new value of `c[i]` will be `c[k + 1]`.

### Final State:
- `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is updated to `pos[i + 2]`.
- `c[i]` is updated to `c[i + 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `j - 1` is set to `i + 2`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is an integer in the range `[2, m]`**.
