To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to some default values (not specified in the initial state, but we assume it is initialized).
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    ans[j - 1] = i + 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Constraints**:
   - `pos[0]` is `0`.
   - For `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, `pos[i + 1]` is calculated as `n + 1 - su - sum(c[k] for k in range(i, m))`.
   - `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - For each `j` in this range, `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`.

3. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - After the loop completes, `ans` will be updated such that the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `d` remain unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` remains unchanged.
   - `su` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` will be updated such that for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`, the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1` for each `i` from `0` to `m - 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.**
