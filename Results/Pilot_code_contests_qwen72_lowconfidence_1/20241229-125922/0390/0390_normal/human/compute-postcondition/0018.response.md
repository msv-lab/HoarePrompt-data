To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints: 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[1]`.
   - `c[i]` is `c[0]`.

3. **Conditions for Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `pos[i + 1]` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - This means `c[i]` must be greater than 0 (since `c[i]` is an integer and 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n`).

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `pos[i + 1]` must be a valid starting point.
   - `c[i]` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` must be less than or equal to `d`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute if the following conditions are met:
- `c[i]` is greater than 0.
- `pos[i + 1]` is a valid starting point (which it is, given the construction of `pos`).
- `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.

Since `c[i]` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0 by the problem constraints, and `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d` as per the initial state, no additional adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is 0; `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`**.
