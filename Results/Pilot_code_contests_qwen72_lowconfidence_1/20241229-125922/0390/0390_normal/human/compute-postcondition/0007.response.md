To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, with constraints: 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` is a list containing one element `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`.
- `su` is `c[m - 1]`.
- `i` is `m - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from `m - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making `i` equal to `m - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` must be decremented from `m - 1` to `m - 2`.
- The value of `su` and `pos` might change depending on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables outside of `i`.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `m - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `ans`, `pos`, `su`) remain unchanged.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `pos` is a list containing one element `n + 1 - c[m - 1]`. `su` is `c[m - 1]`. `i` is `m - 2`.**
