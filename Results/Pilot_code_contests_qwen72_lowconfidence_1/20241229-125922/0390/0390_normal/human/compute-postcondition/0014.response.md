The code snippet `pos.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `pos`. Here's the detailed impact on the program state:

- `pos` originally contains `m` elements, where each element is calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `m - 1` to `0`.
- After appending `0` to `pos`, `pos` now contains `m + 1` elements, with the last element being `0`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `ans`, `su`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first `m` elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `m - 1` to `0`, and the last element is `0`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`, i.e., `su = sum(c)`; `i` is `-1`.**
