To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n` except `ans[j - 1]` which is 2.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is 1.
- `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[2]`.
   - `c[i]` is `c[1]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must increment by 1.
   - The loop will stop when `j` reaches `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The value of `j` will increment by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue if `j` is still less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n` except `ans[j - 1]` which is 2; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is 1; `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`; `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`**.
