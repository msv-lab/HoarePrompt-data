Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements from index `pos[m] - 1` to `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 2` set to `m` if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n).`***
