To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` is a list containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]` and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`.
- `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2]`.
- `i` is `m - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `m - 3`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is decremented by 1: `i = m - 3`.
- `su` is updated by adding `c[i]` to its current value: `su += c[i]`.

Given the current value of `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2]`, after the next iteration, `su` will be `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`.

### Updated State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` remain the same as they are input parameters.
- `c` remains the same as it is a fixed list.
- `ans` remains a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `su` is now `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`.
- `i` is now `m - 3`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, and `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing two elements: `n + 1 - c[m - 1]` and `n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]`; `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`; `i` is `m - 3`.**
