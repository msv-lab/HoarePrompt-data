To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means the loop will only execute if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not run.

2. **Initial State of Loop Variables**:
   - `i` should start at `m - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers within the specified ranges.
   - `c` is a list of `m` integers, each between 1 and `n`, and the sum of these integers is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `pos` is an empty list.
   - `su` is 0.

Given these points, the initial state needs to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to `m - 1`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`. `m` must be greater than 0. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`. `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`. `pos` is an empty list, `su` is 0, `i` is `m - 1`.**
