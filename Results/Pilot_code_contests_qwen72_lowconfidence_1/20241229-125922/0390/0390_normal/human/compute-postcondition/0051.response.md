To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `j` must be incremented by 1.
  - `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`.
  - The other states (`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `pos`, `su`, `i`) remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within this range.

2. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is some value within the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])`.
   - `ans[j - 1]` is set to `i + 1`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - To move to the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `pos`, `su`, `i`) remain unchanged.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be within the range `[pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `ans[j - 1]` remains `i + 1` (since `j` was incremented, `j - 1` now points to the new `j` value from the previous iteration).
- All other states remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `ans[j - 1]` is `i + 1`, `n`, `m`, `d`, `c`, `pos`, `su`, `i` remain unchanged, and `j` must be less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`**
