To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n` except `ans[j - 1]` which is 1.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is 0.
- `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `pos[i + 1]` is `pos[1]`.
   - `c[i]` is `c[0]`.

2. **Loop Range**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `pos[1]` to `pos[1] + c[0]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The new range for the loop will be `pos[2]` to `pos[2] + c[1]`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be incremented to 1.
   - `pos[i + 1]` will now be `pos[2]`.
   - `c[i]` will now be `c[1]`.

5. **Constraints**:
   - `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` must still be less than or equal to `d` for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
- `i` is 1.
- `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` must be less than or equal to `d`.
- The loop will iterate over the range `pos[2]` to `pos[2] + c[1]`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n` except `ans[j - 1]` which is 1; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is 1; `pos[i + 1] - pos[i]` is less than or equal to `d`**
