To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` is an empty list.
- `su` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
    pos.append(n + 1 - su - c[i])
    su += c[i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, `pos` is appended with the value `n + 1 - su - c[i]`.
   - `su` is updated by adding `c[i]` to it.

2. **After Each Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration (`i = m - 1`):
     - `pos` contains `[n + 1 - c[m - 1]]`.
     - `su` is `c[m - 1]`.
   - After the second iteration (`i = m - 2`):
     - `pos` contains `[n + 1 - c[m - 1], n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2]]`.
     - `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2]`.
   - After the third iteration (`i = m - 3`):
     - `pos` contains `[n + 1 - c[m - 1], n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2], n + 1 - c[m - 1] - c[m - 2] - c[m - 3]]`.
     - `su` is `c[m - 1] + c[m - 2] + c[m - 3]`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes all `m` iterations:
     - `pos` will contain `m` elements, each calculated as `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `m - 1` to `0`.
     - `su` will be the sum of all elements in `c`, i.e., `su = sum(c)`.

### Final Output State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m` elements, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `m - 1` to `0`.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`, i.e., `su = sum(c)`.
- `i` is `-1` (since the loop ends when `i` reaches `-1`).

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`; `pos` is a list containing `m` elements, where each element is `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `m - 1` to `0`; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`, i.e., `su = sum(c)`; `i` is `-1`.**
