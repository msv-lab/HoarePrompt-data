The given code snippet `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` modifies the list `ans` by setting the element at index `j - 1` to the value of `i + 1`. Let's break down the changes:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
   - `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n`.
   - `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
   - `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`.
   - `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.
   - `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code `ans[j - 1] = i + 1` sets the element at index `j - 1` in the list `ans` to the value of `i + 1`.
   - Since `i` is `m - 1`, the value `i + 1` is `m`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - The element at index `j - 1` in the list `ans` is now `m`.
   - All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` with `ans[j - 1]` set to `m`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 1`; `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n); `c[m - 1]` is greater than 0.**
