To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n`, and the element at index `j - 1` is now `i + 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is less than `m`.
- `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index and `c[i]` is greater than 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `j` is within the range `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `d` remain unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged (since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `ans`).
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `su` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged (since the loop is iterating over `j`, not `i`).

### Adjusted State:
- `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop will execute again if `j < pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n`, and the element at index `j - 1` is now `i + 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is less than `m`; `pos[i + 1]` is a valid index and `c[i]` is greater than 0; `j` is `pos[i + 1] + 1`**.
