To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop in question is:

```python
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Roles:**
   - `pos`: A list containing `m + 1` elements.
   - `i`: An index initialized to `m - 1`.
   - `c`: A list of `m` integers.
   - `j`: The loop variable.

2. **Current State:**
   - `pos[m]` is set to `min(pos[m - 1] + d, n)`.
   - `pos[m + 1]` is set to `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n)`.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop `for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])` will execute if the range `range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` must be greater than `pos[i + 1]`.

4. **Check the Range:**
   - Since `c[i]` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `c[i]` ≤ `n`), `pos[i + 1] + c[i]` will always be greater than `pos[i + 1]`.
   - Therefore, the range `range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i])` will always contain at least one element.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `c[i]` is a positive integer, which is guaranteed by the constraints provided.
   - No additional adjustments are needed to the state variables for the loop to execute.

### Updated State:
Given the analysis, the state does not need any further adjustments beyond what is already provided. The loop will execute under the current conditions.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements from index `pos[m] - 1` to `pos[m] + c[m - 1] - 2` set to `m` if `pos[i + 1] - pos[i] <= d`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is `m - 1`; `pos[m]` is `min(pos[m - 1] + d, n); `pos[m + 1]` is `min(n + 1 - su - c[m-1] + d, n).**
