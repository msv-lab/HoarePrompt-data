The values of `n`, `m`, and `d` are updated based on the input provided by the `rints` function. The initial conditions for `n`, `m`, and `d` being integers within the specified range, and for `c` being a list of integers satisfying the given constraints, remain valid. The `rints` function reads a line from standard input, splits it by whitespace, and returns a list of integers, which are then unpacked into `n`, `m`, and `d`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers read from input, 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`. `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.**
