To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the conditions required for the loop to run.

### Initial State
- `n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints: 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0.
- `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- `ans` is a list of length `n` where the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`.
- `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order.
- `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`.
- `i` is `m`.

### For Loop Statement
```
for j in range(pos[i + 1], pos[i + 1] + c[i]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` from `pos[i + 1]` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range is valid, i.e., `pos[i + 1]` is less than `pos[i + 1] + c[i]`.

Given that `i` is `m`, we need to check the values of `pos[i + 1]` and `c[i]`:
- `pos[i + 1]` should be a valid index in the `ans` list.
- `c[i]` should be a positive integer.

### Adjustments Needed
- **`i`**: Since `i` is `m`, the loop will not execute because `i + 1` is out of bounds for the `pos` list (which has `m + 1` elements). Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a valid index within the range `[0, m-1]`.
- **`pos[i + 1]`**: This should be a valid index in the `ans` list. Given the constraints, `pos[i + 1]` should be less than `n`.
- **`c[i]`**: This should be a positive integer, and the sum of all `c_i` should be less than or equal to `n`.

### Final State
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `i` should be a valid index within the range `[0, m-1]`.
- `pos[i + 1]` should be a valid index in the `ans` list.
- `c[i]` should be a positive integer.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `d` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `d` ≤ 1000, `m` ≤ `n`, `m` > 0; `c` is a list of `m` integers where each `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ `n` and the sum of all `c_i` is less than or equal to `n`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where the elements from index `pos[i + 1] - 1` to `pos[i + 1] + c[i] - 2` are set to `i + 1`; `pos` is a list containing `m + 1` elements, where the first element is `0`, and the subsequent elements are `n + 1 - su - c[i]` for `i` from `0` to `m - 1` in reverse order; `su` is the sum of all elements in `c`; `i` is an integer in the range `[0, m-1]`**.
