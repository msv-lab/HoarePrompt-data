The function reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `d` and a list `c` of `m` integers from standard input. It then processes these inputs to determine if it is possible to place `m` segments of lengths specified by `c` within the range `[1, n]` such that the distance between the end of one segment and the start of the next is at most `d`. If it is possible, the function prints "YES" followed by a list `ans` of length `n` where each element corresponds to the segment number (1-indexed) that occupies that position. If it is not possible, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where the sum of `c` exceeds `n`, or where the distance constraint `d` makes it impossible to fit all segments within the range `[1, n]`.
