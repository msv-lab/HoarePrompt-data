t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the size of the array a. a is a list of n integers where -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in a is -1, indicating a missing value. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^5.
