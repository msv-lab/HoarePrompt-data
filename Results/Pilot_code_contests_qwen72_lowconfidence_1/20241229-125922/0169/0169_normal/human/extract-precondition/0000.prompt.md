You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array a of n non-negative integers.

Dark created that array 1000 years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) and replaces all missing elements in the array a with k.

Let m be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of |a_i - a_{i+1}| for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) in the array a after Dark replaces all missing elements with k.

Dark should choose an integer k so that m is minimized. Can you help him?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the size of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10 ^ {9}). If a_i = -1, then the i-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4 ⋅ 10 ^ {5}.

Output

Print the answers for each test case in the following format:

You should print two integers, the minimum possible value of m and an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array a equal to m.

Make sure that after replacing all the missing elements with k, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes m.

If there is more than one possible k, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


7
5
-1 10 -1 12 -1
5
-1 40 35 -1 35
6
-1 -1 9 -1 3 -1
2
-1 -1
2
0 -1
4
1 -1 3 -1
7
1 -1 7 5 2 -1 5


Output


1 11
5 35
3 6
0 42
0 0
1 2
3 4

Note

In the first test case after replacing all missing elements with 11 the array becomes [11, 10, 11, 12, 11]. The absolute difference between any adjacent elements is 1. It is impossible to choose a value of k, such that the absolute difference between any adjacent element will be ≤ 0. So, the answer is 1.

In the third test case after replacing all missing elements with 6 the array becomes [6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6].

  * |a_1 - a_2| = |6 - 6| = 0; 
  * |a_2 - a_3| = |6 - 9| = 3; 
  * |a_3 - a_4| = |9 - 6| = 3; 
  * |a_4 - a_5| = |6 - 3| = 3; 
  * |a_5 - a_6| = |3 - 6| = 3. 



So, the maximum difference between any adjacent elements is 3.
Program:
```
def func_2(zero=0):
    conv = ord if py2 else lambda x: x
    A = []
    numb = zero
    sign = 1
    i = 0
    s = sys.stdin.buffer.read()
    try:
        while True:
            if s[i] >= b'0'[0]:
                numb = 10 * numb + conv(s[i]) - 48
            elif s[i] == b'-'[0]:
                sign = -1
            elif s[i] != b'\r'[0]:
                A.append(sign * numb)
                numb = zero
                sign = 1
            i += 1
    except:
        pass
    if s and s[-1] >= b'0'[0]:
        A.append(sign * numb)
    return A
```
