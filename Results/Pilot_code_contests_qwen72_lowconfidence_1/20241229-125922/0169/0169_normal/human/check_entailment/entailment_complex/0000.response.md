Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code, including both `func_1` and `func_2`, appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - `func_2` is designed to parse a byte string into a list of integers. This function is not directly used in the main logic but is included in the code. It correctly handles parsing numbers from the input, even if the input ends unexpectedly or contains invalid characters. However, it is not necessary for the main function `func_1` to work correctly.

2. **Main Logic in `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization and Input Reading:**
     - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `l1`.

   - **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values Adjacent to Missing Elements:**
     - The function iterates through the array to find the minimum (`mini`) and maximum (`maxi`) values among the elements that are adjacent to `-1` (missing elements).
     - This step ensures that the chosen `k` will minimize the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

   - **Choosing `k` and Replacing Missing Elements:**
     - If there are no valid elements adjacent to `-1`, `k` is set to 0.
     - Otherwise, `k` is calculated as the average of `mini` and `maxi` (integer division).
     - The function then replaces all `-1` values in the array with `k`.

   - **Calculating the Maximum Absolute Difference:**
     - The function iterates through the modified array to compute the maximum absolute difference `m` between consecutive elements.
     - It prints the values of `m` and `k` for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Elements Missing:**
     - If all elements in the array are `-1`, the function sets `k` to 0 and the maximum difference `m` to 0, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - **Single Non-Missing Element:**
     - If there is only one non-missing element, the function sets `k` to that element, ensuring the maximum difference `m` is 0.
   - **Multiple Non-Missing Elements:**
     - The function correctly handles multiple non-missing elements and calculates `k` as the average of the minimum and maximum values adjacent to `-1`, minimizing the maximum difference `m`.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description:**
   - The function follows the problem description for every potential case, including edge cases where all elements are missing or only one element is non-missing.
   - The output format matches the required format, printing `m` and `k` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
