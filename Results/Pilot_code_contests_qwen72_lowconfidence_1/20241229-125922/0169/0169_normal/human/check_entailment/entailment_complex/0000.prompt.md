You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array a of n non-negative integers.

Dark created that array 1000 years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) and replaces all missing elements in the array a with k.

Let m be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of |a_i - a_{i+1}| for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) in the array a after Dark replaces all missing elements with k.

Dark should choose an integer k so that m is minimized. Can you help him?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the size of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10 ^ {9}). If a_i = -1, then the i-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4 ⋅ 10 ^ {5}.

Output

Print the answers for each test case in the following format:

You should print two integers, the minimum possible value of m and an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array a equal to m.

Make sure that after replacing all the missing elements with k, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes m.

If there is more than one possible k, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


7
5
-1 10 -1 12 -1
5
-1 40 35 -1 35
6
-1 -1 9 -1 3 -1
2
-1 -1
2
0 -1
4
1 -1 3 -1
7
1 -1 7 5 2 -1 5


Output


1 11
5 35
3 6
0 42
0 0
1 2
3 4

Note

In the first test case after replacing all missing elements with 11 the array becomes [11, 10, 11, 12, 11]. The absolute difference between any adjacent elements is 1. It is impossible to choose a value of k, such that the absolute difference between any adjacent element will be ≤ 0. So, the answer is 1.

In the third test case after replacing all missing elements with 6 the array becomes [6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6].

  * |a_1 - a_2| = |6 - 6| = 0; 
  * |a_2 - a_3| = |6 - 9| = 3; 
  * |a_3 - a_4| = |9 - 6| = 3; 
  * |a_4 - a_5| = |6 - 3| = 3; 
  * |a_5 - a_6| = |3 - 6| = 3. 



So, the maximum difference between any adjacent elements is 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list `l1` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1. For each test case, the function identifies the minimum (`mini`) and maximum (`maxi`) values among the elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1. It then calculates `k` as the integer division of the sum of `mini` and `maxi` by 2, or 0 if no such elements exist. The function replaces all -1 values in `l1` with `k` and computes `m`, the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified list. Finally, the function prints `m` and `k` for each test case. After execution, the state of the program includes the modified list `l1` where -1 values have been replaced with `k`, and the values of `m` and `k` have been printed for each test case.

The function handles exceptions that occur during parsing, such as reaching the end of the string or encountering invalid characters. The final list `A` contains the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of any exception. If the last character of `s` is a digit, the function ensures that the corresponding number is included in `A`. The function returns the list `A`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
-




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
