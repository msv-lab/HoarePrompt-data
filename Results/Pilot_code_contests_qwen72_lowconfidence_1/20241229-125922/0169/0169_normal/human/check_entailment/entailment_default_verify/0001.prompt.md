You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array a of n non-negative integers.

Dark created that array 1000 years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) and replaces all missing elements in the array a with k.

Let m be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of |a_i - a_{i+1}| for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) in the array a after Dark replaces all missing elements with k.

Dark should choose an integer k so that m is minimized. Can you help him?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the size of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10 ^ {9}). If a_i = -1, then the i-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4 ⋅ 10 ^ {5}.

Output

Print the answers for each test case in the following format:

You should print two integers, the minimum possible value of m and an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array a equal to m.

Make sure that after replacing all the missing elements with k, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes m.

If there is more than one possible k, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


7
5
-1 10 -1 12 -1
5
-1 40 35 -1 35
6
-1 -1 9 -1 3 -1
2
-1 -1
2
0 -1
4
1 -1 3 -1
7
1 -1 7 5 2 -1 5


Output


1 11
5 35
3 6
0 42
0 0
1 2
3 4

Note

In the first test case after replacing all missing elements with 11 the array becomes [11, 10, 11, 12, 11]. The absolute difference between any adjacent elements is 1. It is impossible to choose a value of k, such that the absolute difference between any adjacent element will be ≤ 0. So, the answer is 1.

In the third test case after replacing all missing elements with 6 the array becomes [6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6].

  * |a_1 - a_2| = |6 - 6| = 0; 
  * |a_2 - a_3| = |6 - 9| = 3; 
  * |a_3 - a_4| = |9 - 6| = 3; 
  * |a_4 - a_5| = |6 - 3| = 3; 
  * |a_5 - a_6| = |3 - 6| = 3. 



So, the maximum difference between any adjacent elements is 3.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive missing elements (`-1`) correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining `k` and `m` does not account for the fact that the choice of `k` can affect the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements differently depending on the positions of the missing elements.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
-1 -1 10
```
In this case, the optimal `k` would be `5`, resulting in the array `[5, 5, 10]` with a maximum absolute difference of `5`. However, the program might incorrectly set `k` to `0` or another value that does not minimize the maximum absolute difference.

To fix this issue, the program should consider the differences between all known elements and their neighbors, and choose `k` based on the minimum and maximum values of these differences. Additionally, the program should ensure that the chosen `k` minimizes the maximum absolute difference for all possible configurations of missing elements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a byte string `s` from the standard input, which represents a sequence of numbers and possibly a negative sign ('-'), where each number is separated by a non-digit character (excluding '\r'). The function parses these numbers into signed integers and appends them to a list `A`. The function handles exceptions that occur during parsing, such as reaching the end of the string or encountering invalid characters. The final list `A` contains the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of any exception. If the last character of `s` is a digit, the function ensures that the corresponding number is included in `A`. The function returns the list `A`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
