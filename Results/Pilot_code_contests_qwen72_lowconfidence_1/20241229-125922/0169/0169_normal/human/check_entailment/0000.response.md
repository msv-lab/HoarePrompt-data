Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a flaw in how it handles the replacement of missing elements. Specifically, the logic for determining `k` and calculating `m` does not always ensure that `m` is minimized correctly. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
Input:
1
4
1 -1 3 -1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2 2
```

**Explanation of the Failure:**
- The input array is `[1, -1, 3, -1]`.
- The program calculates `k` as 2, which is correct.
- However, the program calculates `m` as 2, which is incorrect. The correct `m` should be 1.

The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the calculation of `m` when there are multiple consecutive missing elements. In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements. To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles the replacement of missing elements and the calculation of `m` in all cases, especially when there are consecutive missing elements.
