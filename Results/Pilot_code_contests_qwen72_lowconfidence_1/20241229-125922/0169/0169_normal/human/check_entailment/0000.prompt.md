You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Dark is going to attend Motarack's birthday. Dark decided that the gift he is going to give to Motarack is an array a of n non-negative integers.

Dark created that array 1000 years ago, so some elements in that array disappeared. Dark knows that Motarack hates to see an array that has two adjacent elements with a high absolute difference between them. He doesn't have much time so he wants to choose an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) and replaces all missing elements in the array a with k.

Let m be the maximum absolute difference between all adjacent elements (i.e. the maximum value of |a_i - a_{i+1}| for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) in the array a after Dark replaces all missing elements with k.

Dark should choose an integer k so that m is minimized. Can you help him?

Input

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}) — the size of the array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (-1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10 ^ {9}). If a_i = -1, then the i-th integer is missing. It is guaranteed that at least one integer is missing in every test case.

It is guaranteed, that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4 ⋅ 10 ^ {5}.

Output

Print the answers for each test case in the following format:

You should print two integers, the minimum possible value of m and an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{9}) that makes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in the array a equal to m.

Make sure that after replacing all the missing elements with k, the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements becomes m.

If there is more than one possible k, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


7
5
-1 10 -1 12 -1
5
-1 40 35 -1 35
6
-1 -1 9 -1 3 -1
2
-1 -1
2
0 -1
4
1 -1 3 -1
7
1 -1 7 5 2 -1 5


Output


1 11
5 35
3 6
0 42
0 0
1 2
3 4

Note

In the first test case after replacing all missing elements with 11 the array becomes [11, 10, 11, 12, 11]. The absolute difference between any adjacent elements is 1. It is impossible to choose a value of k, such that the absolute difference between any adjacent element will be ≤ 0. So, the answer is 1.

In the third test case after replacing all missing elements with 6 the array becomes [6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 6].

  * |a_1 - a_2| = |6 - 6| = 0; 
  * |a_2 - a_3| = |6 - 9| = 3; 
  * |a_3 - a_4| = |9 - 6| = 3; 
  * |a_4 - a_5| = |6 - 3| = 3; 
  * |a_5 - a_6| = |3 - 6| = 3. 



So, the maximum difference between any adjacent elements is 3.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
