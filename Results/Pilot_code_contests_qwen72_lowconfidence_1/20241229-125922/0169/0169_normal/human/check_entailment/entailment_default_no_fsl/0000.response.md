Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the value of `k` and the maximum absolute difference `m` is flawed in certain scenarios.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Consecutive Missing Elements:**
   - The function does not correctly handle cases where there are consecutive missing elements (`-1`). For example, consider the input:
     ```
     4
     -1 -1 3 -1
     ```
     The function should ideally find a `k` that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements. However, the current implementation may not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect `k` and `m`.

2. **Edge Case with Only Two Elements:**
   - When the array has only two elements, and one of them is missing, the function should still find a `k` that minimizes the maximum absolute difference. For example:
     ```
     2
     0 -1
     ```
     The function should output `0 0` because the minimum possible value of `m` is 0, and `k` can be 0. However, the current implementation might not handle this edge case correctly.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `k`:**
   - The function calculates `k` as the average of the minimum and maximum values adjacent to `-1`. This approach might not always yield the optimal `k` that minimizes the maximum absolute difference `m`. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     5
     -1 10 -1 12 -1
     ```
     The function should output `1 11`, but the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
1
4
-1 -1 3 -1
```
The expected output is:
```
1 2
```
However, the current implementation might output:
```
3 1
```
This is incorrect because the maximum absolute difference can be minimized to 1 by choosing `k = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
