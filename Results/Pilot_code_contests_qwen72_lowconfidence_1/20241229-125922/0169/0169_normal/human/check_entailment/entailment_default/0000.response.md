Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the array has multiple segments of missing elements (-1) that are not adjacent to any known values. In such cases, the function might incorrectly set `mini` and `maxi` to -1, leading to `k` being set to 0, which might not minimize the maximum absolute difference `m`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```
The function will set `mini` and `maxi` to -1, and thus `k` will be 0. This means all -1 values will be replaced with 0, resulting in the array `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, and the maximum absolute difference `m` will be 0. However, this is not the correct solution because the problem requires finding a `k` that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, and in this case, any value of `k` would result in `m` being 0.

Another example where the function might fail is:
```
1
5
-1 10 -1 12 -1
```
The function will set `mini` to 10 and `maxi` to 12, and thus `k` will be `(10 + 12) // 2 = 11`. This results in the array `[11, 10, 11, 12, 11]`, and the maximum absolute difference `m` will be 1. However, if `k` were set to 10 or 12, the maximum absolute difference `m` would still be 1, but the function does not explore these possibilities.

Therefore, the function does not always produce the correct output for every potential case, making it incorrect.
