Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple consecutive missing elements (`-1`) correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining `k` and `m` does not account for the fact that the choice of `k` can affect the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements differently depending on the positions of the missing elements.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
-1 -1 10
```
In this case, the optimal `k` would be `5`, resulting in the array `[5, 5, 10]` with a maximum absolute difference of `5`. However, the program might incorrectly set `k` to `0` or another value that does not minimize the maximum absolute difference.

To fix this issue, the program should consider the differences between all known elements and their neighbors, and choose `k` based on the minimum and maximum values of these differences. Additionally, the program should ensure that the chosen `k` minimizes the maximum absolute difference for all possible configurations of missing elements.
