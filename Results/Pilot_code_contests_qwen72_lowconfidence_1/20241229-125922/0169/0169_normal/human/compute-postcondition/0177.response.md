The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the values of `m` and `k`. This does not change the state of any variables; it only displays their current values. Since the initial state already defines the values of `m` and `k`, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing these values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers where any `-1` values are replaced with `k` (which is 0), `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined. The values of `m` and `k` have been printed.**
