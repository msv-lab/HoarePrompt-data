The function `func_1` does not explicitly show its parameters in the given snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a list `l1` of integers and possibly the length `n` of this list. However, since the actual function signature only shows `def func_1():`, we will assume that the parameters are part of the function's internal logic or are passed in a way not shown in the snippet.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- At least one element in `l1` is -1

The output is not specified, so I will infer based on common programming tasks involving such constraints. Typically, such a function might involve processing the list to find a specific value or condition related to the presence of -1 in the list.

However, without the actual function body or a clear specification of the output, the most accurate description I can provide is:

The function `func_1` implicitly works with a list `l1` of integers, where `l1` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and each element `a_i` in `l1` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, with at least one element being -1. The exact output of the function is not specified, but it is likely related to processing the list based on the presence of -1.

Functionality: **The function works with a list `l1` of integers, where `l1` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and each element `a_i` in `l1` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, with at least one element being -1.
