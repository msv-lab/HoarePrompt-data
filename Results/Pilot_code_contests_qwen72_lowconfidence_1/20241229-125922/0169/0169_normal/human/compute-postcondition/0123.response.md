The value of `flag` is set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 1, `maxi` and `mini` are unchanged. If `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
