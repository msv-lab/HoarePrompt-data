To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input.
   - `temp` is 0.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `mini` and `maxi` are determined based on specific conditions related to the list `l1`.

3. **Conditions for `mini` and `maxi`**:
   - If `mini` is -1, `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).
   - Otherwise, `k` is set to `(maxi + mini) // 2`.
   - `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position.
   - `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - Ensure `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - Ensure `mini` and `maxi` are correctly calculated based on the given conditions.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` must be 0.
- `mini` and `maxi` must be calculated based on the conditions provided.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)**.
