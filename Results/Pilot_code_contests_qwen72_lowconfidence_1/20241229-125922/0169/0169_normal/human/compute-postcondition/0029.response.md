Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to the byte representation of '0', `numb` is `10 * (conv(s[0]) - 48) + conv(s[1]) - 48`, and `sign` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition. If `s[i]` is the byte representation of '-', `numb` is `conv(s[0]) - 48` if `s[0]` is greater than or equal to 48, otherwise `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1, and `A` remains an empty list. If `s[i]` is neither the byte representation of '-' nor '0' through '9', `numb` is `conv(s[0]) - 48` if `s[0]` is greater than or equal to 48, otherwise `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1 if `s[i]` is not the byte representation of `\r`, otherwise `sign` retains its initial value, and `A` is `[0]`.***
