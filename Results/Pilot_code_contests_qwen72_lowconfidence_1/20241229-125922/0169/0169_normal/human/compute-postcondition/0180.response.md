The code snippet `l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l1`.

- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `l1` is now a list of integers based on the new input.
- `temp` is 0 (unchanged).
- `count` is 0 (unchanged).
- `k` is 0 (unchanged).
- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list (unchanged because the list `l1` has been redefined, but `m` calculation is not performed here).
- `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined (unchanged).
- The number of iterations remaining is `n` (unchanged).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, the number of iterations remaining is `n`.**
