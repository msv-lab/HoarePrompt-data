Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0' (48), `numb` is set to `conv(s[i]) - 48` and `sign` is 1. If `s[i]` is less than the ASCII value of '0' (48), `A` is an empty list if `s[i]` is the byte representation of `'-'` (i.e., `b'-'[0]`), otherwise `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is 0, and `sign` is -1 if `s[i]` is the byte representation of `'-'`, otherwise `sign` is 1.***
