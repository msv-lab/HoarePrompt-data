To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `l1` is a list of integers.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`.
- `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined.
- `i` is 1.
- If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0.
- If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `temp`, `count`, `k`, `m`, `mini`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 2. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0.**
