Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1. The current value of `mini` is -1, `k` is 0.**
