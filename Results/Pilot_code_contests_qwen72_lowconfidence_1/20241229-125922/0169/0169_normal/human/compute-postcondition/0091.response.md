The provided Python code snippet reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the list `l1`. This action updates the value of `l1` based on the new input, potentially changing its length and contents. However, since the exact input is not specified, we can only say that `l1` now contains a list of integers read from the input.

The variables `n`, `temp`, `count`, `mini`, `maxi`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and values as stated in the initial state, except that `l1` has been updated with new values, which could affect the values of `mini`, `maxi`, and `k` if they are recalculated based on the new `l1`.

Given that the code snippet does not redefine or recalculate `mini`, `maxi`, `k`, or `m` based on the new `l1`, these variables retain their original meanings and values as defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2` if `mini` is not -1 otherwise `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed.**
