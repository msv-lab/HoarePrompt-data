Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 1, `numb` is set to `conv(s[0]) - 48` if `s[0]` is greater than or equal to 48, otherwise `numb` is 0. If `s[i]` is the byte representation of `'-'`, then `sign` is -1 and `A` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `A` is `[0]` and `sign` is 1 if `s[i]` is not the byte representation of `\r`, otherwise `sign` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition.***
