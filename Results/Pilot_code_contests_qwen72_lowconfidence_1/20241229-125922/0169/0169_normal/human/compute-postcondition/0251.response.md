Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input. If `l1[i + 1]` is `-1`, `l1[i + 1]` is updated to `k`. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), and `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist). If `l1[i]` is `-1`, then `l1[i]` is updated to `k`. Otherwise, `l1[i]` remains unchanged.***
