To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `l1` is a list of integers.
  - If `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`.
  - If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0.
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1, so `n - 1` is at least 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n - 1` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, which means `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers, if `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`, if `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), if `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`**
