To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1
- `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1
- If `mini` is -1, then `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`
- `m` is `max(abs(l1[1] - l1[0]), 0)`
- `i` is 0
- If `l1[i]` is -1, `l1[0]` is set to `k`; otherwise, `l1` remains unchanged

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `i` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
- The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `temp`, `count`, `mini`, `maxi`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is omitted.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is `max(abs(l1[1] - l1[0]), 0), `i` is 1`**
