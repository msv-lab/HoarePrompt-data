Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `mini` remains as it was before the if-else block. If `mini` was -1, `mini` is set to `l1[2]`. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `l1[2]`. If `i < n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` is -1, `flag` is set to 1; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged. If `maxi` was -1, `maxi` is set to `l1[2]`. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `l1[2]`.***
