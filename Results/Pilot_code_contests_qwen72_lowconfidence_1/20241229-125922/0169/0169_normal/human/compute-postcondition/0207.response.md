Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, the number of iterations remaining is `n`. If `flag` is 1, `mini` is set to the minimum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`. Similarly, `maxi` is set to the maximum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`. If `i` > 0 and the element at index `i - 1` in `l1` is -1, `flag` is set to 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i + 1` in `l1` is -1, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.***
