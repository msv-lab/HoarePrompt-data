The line `mini = min(mini, l1[i])` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `l1[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers read from the input
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`
- `m` and `k` have been printed
- `maxi` and `mini` are unchanged
- If `i` < `n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` == -1, then `flag` is 1
- If `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped
- Otherwise, `flag` remains as it was before the if-else block

The line `mini = min(mini, l1[i])` will update `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `l1[i]`. Since `i` is 1, this means `mini` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `l1[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers read from the input
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `k` is 0
- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`
- `m` and `k` have been printed
- `maxi` is unchanged
- `mini` is the minimum of its original value and `l1[1]`
- If `i` < `n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` == -1, then `flag` is 1
- If `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped
- Otherwise, `flag` remains as it was before the if-else block

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `maxi` is unchanged, `mini` is the minimum of its original value and `l1[1]`, if `i` < `n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` == -1, then `flag` is 1, if `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, otherwise, `flag` remains as it was before the if-else block.**
