The value of `numb` is updated to the value of `zero`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s[i] < b'0'[0]`, `s[i] != b'-'[0]`, `s[i] != b'\r'[0]**
