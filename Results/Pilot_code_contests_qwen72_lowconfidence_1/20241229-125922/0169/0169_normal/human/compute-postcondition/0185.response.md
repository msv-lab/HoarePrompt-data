To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list.
- `mini` is -1.
- `maxi` is -1.
- The number of iterations remaining is `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` should start at 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The other variables (`temp`, `count`, `k`, `m`, `mini`, `maxi`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should be in their initial states as provided.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
- The other variables should remain as they are initially set.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, the number of iterations remaining is `n`**
