Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2, `numb` retains its initial value, and `A` retains its initial value. If `s[i]` is equal to `b'-'[0]`, `sign` is -1. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not equal to `b'\r'[0]`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, and `A` is now `[..., 1 * numb]`.***
