The code snippet `maxi = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `maxi`. This overwrites the previous value of `maxi`, which was the maximum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a `-1`.

Therefore, the updated state of the program is:

- `n` is an input integer
- `l1` is a list of integers read from the input
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `mini` is -1
- `maxi` is -1
- `k` is 0
- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`
- `m` and `k` have been printed

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed.**
