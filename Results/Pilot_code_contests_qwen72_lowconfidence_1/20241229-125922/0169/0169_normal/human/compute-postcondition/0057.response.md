The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `l1[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1. The specific values of `l1[0]`, `l1[1]`, and `l1[2]` are not provided, but we know `l1[2]` is within the specified range.

If `maxi` was initially -1, it will be updated to the value of `l1[2]` if `l1[2]` is greater than -1. If `maxi` had a value greater than -1, it will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `l1[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `i` is 2. If `i < n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` is -1, `flag` is 1. If `l1[0]` is -1, `mini` is set to `l1[1]` if `mini` is not -1; otherwise, `mini` is assigned the value of `l1[1]`. If `maxi` is -1, then `maxi` is set to `l1[1]`; otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum value between the initial `maxi` and `l1[1]`. If `l1[0]` is not -1, `flag` remains 1. If `l1[i]` is -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described above. If `i >= n - 1` or `l1[i + 1]` is not -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged as described in the precondition. If `mini` is -1, `mini` is set to `l1[2]`. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum value between the initial `mini` and `l1[2]`. `maxi` is the maximum value between the initial `maxi` and `l1[2]`.**
