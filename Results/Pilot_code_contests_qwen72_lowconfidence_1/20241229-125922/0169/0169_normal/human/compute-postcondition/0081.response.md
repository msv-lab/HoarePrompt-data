To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1.
- `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1.
- If `mini` is -1, then `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`.
- `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), m)`.
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- The other variables (`n`, `l1`, `temp`, `count`, `mini`, `maxi`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged because they are not directly modified by the loop increment.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), m)`, `i` is 2**.
