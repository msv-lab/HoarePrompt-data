Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 2. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is set to 0 (and this change is made if the condition `l1[i] == -1` is true). If `l1[3]` is -1, it is set to 0.***
