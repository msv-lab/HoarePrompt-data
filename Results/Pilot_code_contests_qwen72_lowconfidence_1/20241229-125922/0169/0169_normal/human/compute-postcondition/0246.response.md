Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), and the element at index `i + 1` in `l1` is `-1`.***
