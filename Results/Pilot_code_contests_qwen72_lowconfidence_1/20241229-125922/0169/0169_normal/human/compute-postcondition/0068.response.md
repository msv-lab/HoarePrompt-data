Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i + 1` in `l1` is -1.**
