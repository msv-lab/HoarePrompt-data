The code snippet `l1[i] = k` updates the element at index `i` in the list `l1` to the value `k`.

- Initial State: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers. If `l1[3]` is `-1`, then `l1[3]` is updated to `k`. Additionally, if `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`, and if `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`. If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0. `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), and `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).

- Impact of the Code:
  - The value of `l1[2]` is updated to `k`.
  - The values of `n`, `i`, `l1[0]`, `l1[1]`, `l1[3]`, `temp`, `count`, `m`, `mini`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers with `l1[2]` updated to `k`. If `l1[3]` is `-1`, then `l1[3]` is updated to `k`. Additionally, if `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`, and if `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0. `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), and `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).**
