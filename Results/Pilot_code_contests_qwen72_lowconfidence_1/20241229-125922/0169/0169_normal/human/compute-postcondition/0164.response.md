To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `l1` is a list of integers read from the input. If `l1[0] == -1`, then `l1[0]` is set to 0.
   - `temp` is 0.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `m` is `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`.
   - `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1.
- `l1` remains the same list of integers, with `l1[0]` possibly modified if it was initially -1.
- `temp` remains 0.
- `count` remains 0.
- `k` remains 0.
- `m` remains `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`.
- `mini` and `maxi` remain as previously defined.
- `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input (with `l1[0]` set to 0 if it was -1), `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 1**.
