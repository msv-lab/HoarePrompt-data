The code snippet `l1[i + 1] = k` changes the value of the element at index `i + 1` in the list `l1` to `k`. Given that `i` is 0 and the element at index `i + 1` (which is index 1) was initially -1, this element is now updated to the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input with `l1[1] = k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 0**
