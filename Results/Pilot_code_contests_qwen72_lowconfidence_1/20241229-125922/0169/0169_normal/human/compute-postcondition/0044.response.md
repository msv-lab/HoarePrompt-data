Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` contains the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of the exception, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, and `i` is the index at which the exception occurred or the length of `s`. Additionally, `s` is non-empty, and the last character of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0'.***
