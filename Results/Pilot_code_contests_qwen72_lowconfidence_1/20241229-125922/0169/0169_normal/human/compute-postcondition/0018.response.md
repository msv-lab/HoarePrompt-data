Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is an empty list if `s[i] == b'-'[0]`, otherwise `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1 if `s[i] == b'-'[0]`, otherwise `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s[i] < b'0'[0]`, and `s[i]` is equal to the byte representation of `'-'` (i.e., `b'-'[0]`) if `s[i] == b'-'[0]`, otherwise `s[i]` is not equal to `b'-'[0]` and is not equal to `b'\r'[0]` if `s[i] != b'\r'[0]`.***
