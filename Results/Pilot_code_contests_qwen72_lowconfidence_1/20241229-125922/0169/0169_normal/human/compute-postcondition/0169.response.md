The code snippet updates the value of `m` to be the maximum of the current value of `m` and the absolute difference between `l1[i + 1]` and `l1[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the code effectively calculates `m` as the maximum of `m` and `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `m` was initially set to `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`.
- `i` is 1, so `l1[i]` is `l1[1]` and `l1[i + 1]` is `l1[2]`.
- The new value of `m` is calculated as `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), m)`.

Since the initial state specifies that if `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0, and if `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0, we need to consider these conditions when calculating the new value of `m`.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `l1` is a list of integers, with `l1[1]` and `l1[2]` potentially updated to 0 if they were -1.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `m` is now `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`.
- `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined.
- `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 1. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0.**
