Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is `[0]`, `i` is 1, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to the byte representation of `\r`, otherwise `sign` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition.***
