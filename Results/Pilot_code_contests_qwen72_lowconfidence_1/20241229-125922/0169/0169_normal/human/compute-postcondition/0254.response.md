The code snippet `l1[i + 1] = k` updates the element at index `i + 1` of the list `l1` to the value `k`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` is greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input (changed).
- `temp` is 0 (unchanged).
- `count` is 0 (unchanged).
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])` and 0 (unchanged).
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist) (unchanged).
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist) (unchanged).
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`. Otherwise, `l1[0]` remains unchanged (unchanged).

After executing the code snippet:
- The element at index `i + 1` (which is 2) of the list `l1` is set to `k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input with `l1[2]` set to `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])` and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), if `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`. Otherwise, `l1[0]` remains unchanged.**
