The code snippet sets the variable `flag` to 1. This changes the value of `flag` from its initial state of 0 to 1. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `flag`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 1, `maxi` and `mini` remain as they were before the if-else block. If `l1[i]` is -1, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
