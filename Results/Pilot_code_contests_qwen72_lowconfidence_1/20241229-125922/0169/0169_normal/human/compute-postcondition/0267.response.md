Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where any `-1` values are replaced with `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a `-1` (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a `-1` (or -1 if no such elements exist), `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2` if `mini` is not -1 otherwise `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1`, and the values of `m` and `k` have been printed for each iteration of the outer loop.**
