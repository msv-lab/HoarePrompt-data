Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers where any `-1` in the list has been replaced by `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the updated `l1`, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in the original `l1` that had a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in the original `l1` that had a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist). If `n` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 0.**
