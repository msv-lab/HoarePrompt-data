Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, the number of iterations remaining is `n`. If `i` > 0 and the element at index `i - 1` in `l1` is -1, `flag` is set to 1. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i + 1` in `l1` is -1, `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0. The current value of `flag` is 1.***
