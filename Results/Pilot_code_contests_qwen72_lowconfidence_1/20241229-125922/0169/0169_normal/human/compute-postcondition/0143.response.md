`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `l1[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is 2, `mini` is now the minimum value between its previous value and `l1[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `maxi` and `mini` remain as they were before the if-else block, `mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `l1[2]`, if `i < n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` is -1, `flag` is set to 1; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
