The code snippet `A.append(sign * numb)` appends the product of `sign` and `numb` to the list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `zero` remains 0.
- `s` remains the byte string read from the standard input.
- `conv` remains `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged.
- `i` remains 2.
- `numb` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition.
- `sign` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition.
- `A` now includes the new element `sign * numb`.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2, `numb` retains its initial value, `sign` retains its initial value, `A` is now `[..., sign * numb]`**
