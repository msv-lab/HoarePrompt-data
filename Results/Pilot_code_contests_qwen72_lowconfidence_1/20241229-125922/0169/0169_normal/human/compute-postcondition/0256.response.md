Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input
- If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])` and 0
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`. Otherwise, `l1[0]` remains unchanged.

The code snippet:
```python
l1[i] = k
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is set to 1.
- The code `l1[i] = k` updates the element at index 1 of the list `l1` to the value of `k`.

### Updated Values:
- `l1[1]` is now `k`.

### Unchanged Values:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers, with `l1[1]` now being `k`.
- If `l1[2]` was `-1`, it remains `k` if it was already updated to `k`.
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])` and 0, which now involves `k`.
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist).
- If `l1[0]` was `-1`, it remains `k`.

### Output State:
**`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers where `l1[1]` is `k`, if `l1[2]` is `-1` then `l1[2]` is `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])` and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), if `l1[0]` is `-1` then `l1[0]` is `k`.**
