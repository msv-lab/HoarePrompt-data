The code prints the values of `m` and `k`. The values of `m` and `k` are already determined based on the initial state and the modifications made to `l1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

- `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`.
- `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2` if `mini` is not -1, otherwise `k` is 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and all -1s have been replaced with `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in the original `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2` if `mini` is not -1 otherwise `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed.**
