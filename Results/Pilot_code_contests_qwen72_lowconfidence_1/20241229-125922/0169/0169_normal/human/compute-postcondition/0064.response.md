The value of `k` is calculated as `(maxi + mini) // 2`. This means `k` is the integer division of the sum of `maxi` and `mini` by 2. The values of `n`, `l1`, `temp`, `count`, `mini`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `mini` is not -1, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`**
