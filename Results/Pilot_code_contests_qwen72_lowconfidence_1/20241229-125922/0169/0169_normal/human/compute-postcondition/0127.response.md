`mini` is assigned the value of `l1[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `mini` now holds the value of the second element in the list `l1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `maxi` and `mini` are unchanged, `mini` is `l1[1]`, if `i` < `n - 1` and `l1[i + 1]` == -1, then `flag` is 1, if `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, otherwise, `flag` remains as it was before the if-else block.**
