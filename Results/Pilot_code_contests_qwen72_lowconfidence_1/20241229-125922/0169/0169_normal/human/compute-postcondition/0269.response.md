Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list `l1` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1. For each test case, the function identifies the minimum (`mini`) and maximum (`maxi`) values among the elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1. It then calculates `k` as the integer division of the sum of `mini` and `maxi` by 2, or 0 if no such elements exist. The function replaces all -1 values in `l1` with `k` and computes `m`, the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified list. Finally, the function prints `m` and `k` for each test case. After execution, the state of the program includes the modified list `l1` where -1 values have been replaced with `k`, and the values of `m` and `k` have been printed for each test case. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If `l1` contains only a single -1 and no other elements, `mini` and `maxi` will both be -1, leading to `k` being 0. This scenario is handled correctly by the code.
- If `l1` contains multiple -1s but no adjacent non-negative integers, `mini` and `maxi` will remain -1, and `k` will be 0. This is also correctly handled.
- The function assumes that the input is always valid (i.e., `n` is within the specified range, and `l1` contains at least one -1). If invalid input is provided, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `l1` might contain duplicate -1s next to each other. However, the code correctly skips over these -1s without affecting the calculation of `mini` and `maxi`.
