The value of `l1[i]` is set to `k`. Since `i` is 0 and `k` is 0, the first element of the list `l1` is set to 0. The conditions that `l1[1] == -1` and `l1[i]` being -1 no longer apply because `i` is 0 and `l1[0]` has been updated. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input with `l1[0]` set to 0, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 0.**
