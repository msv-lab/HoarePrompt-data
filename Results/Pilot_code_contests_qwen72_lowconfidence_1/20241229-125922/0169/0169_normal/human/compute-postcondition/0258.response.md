The given Python code snippet updates the value of `m` by comparing the current value of `m` with the absolute difference between the current element `l1[i]` and the next element `l1[i + 1]` in the list `l1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers
- If `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`
- If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])` and 0
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`

The code snippet:
```python
m = max(abs(l1[i + 1] - l1[i]), m)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `l1[i]` is `l1[1]`
   - `l1[i + 1]` is `l1[2]`

2. **Calculate `abs(l1[i + 1] - l1[i])`**:
   - This calculates the absolute difference between `l1[2]` and `l1[1]`.

3. **Update `m`**:
   - `m` is updated to the maximum of the current value of `m` and the absolute difference calculated in the previous step.

### Output State:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `l1` is a list of integers
- If `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`
- If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers, if `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`, if `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), if `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`**.
