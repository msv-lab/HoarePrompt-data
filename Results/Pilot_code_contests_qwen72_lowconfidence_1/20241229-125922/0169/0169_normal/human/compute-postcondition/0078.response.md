The code snippet `l1[i] = k` updates the value of the element at index `i` in the list `l1` to the value of `k`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
- `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1
- `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1
- if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`
- `m` is `max(abs(l1[1] - l1[0]), 0)`
- `i` is 1
- If `l1[i + 1]` is -1, then `l1[2]` is set to `k`

After executing the code snippet `l1[i] = k`, the element at index `i` (which is 1) in the list `l1` is updated to the value of `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is `max(abs(l1[1] - l1[0]), 0), `i` is 1, `l1[1]` is `k`. If `l1[i + 1]` is -1, then `l1[2]` is set to `k`.**
