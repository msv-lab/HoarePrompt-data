The code snippet `sign = 1` sets the value of `sign` to 1. This overrides any previous value of `sign`.

Let's list the updated state:

- `zero` remains 0.
- `s` remains the byte string read from the standard input.
- `conv` remains set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it remains a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged.
- `A` remains `[0]`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `numb` remains 0.
- `sign` is now 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is `[0]`, `i` is 1, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1.**
