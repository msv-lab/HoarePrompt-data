The value of `k` is calculated as `(maxi + mini) // 2`. Since `mini` is not equal to -1, `maxi` and `mini` are specific values from the list `l1` based on the conditions provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `l1`, `temp`, `count`, `m`, `mini`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position, `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position, and `mini` is not equal to -1.**
