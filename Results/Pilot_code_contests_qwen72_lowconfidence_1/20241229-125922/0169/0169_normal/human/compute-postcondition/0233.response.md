Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `maxi` is the maximum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`, `flag` is 1 if `l1[i - 1] == -1` and 0 otherwise, the number of iterations remaining is `n - 2`. If `mini` was initially -1, `mini` is set to `l1[2]`. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of its original value and `l1[2]`. If `i < n - 1` and `l1[i + 1] == -1`, the current iteration is skipped, and `i` will be 3. Otherwise, the current iteration continues as usual.***
