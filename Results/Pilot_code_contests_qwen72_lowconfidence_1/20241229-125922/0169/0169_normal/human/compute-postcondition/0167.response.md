The code snippet `l1[i] = k` updates the element at index `i` in the list `l1` to the value of `k`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `k` is 0, so the second element of the list `l1` (index 1) will be set to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers where `l1[1]` is 0, if `l1[2]` is -1, it is set to 0, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, and `i` is 1.**
