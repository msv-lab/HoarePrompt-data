The code snippet `l1[i + 1] = k` updates the element at index `i + 1` of the list `l1` to the value `k`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 2
- `l1` is a list of integers
- If `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`
- If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`
- `temp` is 0
- `count` is 0
- `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0
- `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist)
- If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`

The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. Therefore, `l1[3]` is updated to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers where `l1[3]` is now `k`, if `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`, if `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])`, `abs(l1[2] - l1[1])`, and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), if `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`**
