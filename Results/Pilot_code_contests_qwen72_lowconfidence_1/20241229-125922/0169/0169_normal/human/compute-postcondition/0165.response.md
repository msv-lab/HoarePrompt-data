The value of `l1[i + 1]` is set to the value of `k`. Given that `i` is 1, `l1[2]` is set to `k`, which is 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers with `l1[2]` set to 0, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `abs(l1[1] - l1[0])`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 1**
