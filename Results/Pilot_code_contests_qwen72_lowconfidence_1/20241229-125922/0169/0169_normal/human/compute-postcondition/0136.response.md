The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that none of the variables are altered by this statement, but the control flow is affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 0, `maxi` and `mini` remain as they were before the if-else block, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
