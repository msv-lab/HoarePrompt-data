Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers. If `l1[1]` is `-1`, then `l1[1]` is updated to `k`. If `l1[2]` is `-1`, then `l1[2]` is updated to `k`. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum of `abs(k - l1[0])` and 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist). If `l1[0]` is `-1`, then `l1[0]` is updated to `k`.***
