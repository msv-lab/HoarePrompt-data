Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 0. If `i` > 0 and the element at index `i - 1` in `l1` is -1, then `flag` is set to 1. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and the element at index `i + 1` in `l1` is -1, `flag` is set to 1.***
