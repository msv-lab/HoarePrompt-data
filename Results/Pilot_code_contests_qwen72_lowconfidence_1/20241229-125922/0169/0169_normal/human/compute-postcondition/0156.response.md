To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the condition under which the `for` loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one element. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n` must be greater than 1**: This ensures that the range `range(n - 1)` has at least one element, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
2. **`i` is 0**: Before the loop starts, the loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.

The other variables (`l1`, `temp`, `count`, `k`, `m`, `mini`, and `maxi`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they should be mentioned in the state to provide a complete picture.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 0**
