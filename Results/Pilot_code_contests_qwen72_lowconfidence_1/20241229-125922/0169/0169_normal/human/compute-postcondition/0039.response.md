Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2. If `s[i] >= b'0'[0]`, `numb` is updated to `10 * numb + conv(s[2]) - 48`, and `sign` and `A` retain their initial values. If `s[i]` is `b'-'[0]`, `sign` is -1, and `numb` and `A` retain their initial values. If `s[i]` is not `b'0'[0]` and not `b'-'[0]` and not `b'\r'[0]`, `numb` is set to 0, `sign` is 1, and `A` is updated to `[..., 1 * numb]`.***
