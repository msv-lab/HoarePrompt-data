Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a byte string `s` from the standard input, which represents a sequence of numbers and possibly a negative sign ('-'), where each number is separated by a non-digit character (excluding '\r'). The function parses these numbers into signed integers and appends them to a list `A`. The function handles exceptions that occur during parsing, such as reaching the end of the string or encountering invalid characters. The final list `A` contains the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of any exception. If the last character of `s` is a digit, the function ensures that the corresponding number is included in `A`. The function returns the list `A`.

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Empty Input:** If the input string `s` is empty, the function will return an empty list `A`.
- **No Numbers:** If the input string `s` contains no valid numbers (e.g., only non-digit characters), the function will return an empty list `A`.
- **Trailing Non-Digit Characters:** If the input string `s` ends with a non-digit character (excluding '\r'), the last number being parsed will not be appended to `A`.
- **Invalid Characters:** If the input string `s` contains invalid characters (e.g., letters or special symbols other than '-' and digits), the function will stop parsing at the first invalid character and return the list `A` up to that point.
- **Multiple Negative Signs:** If the input string `s` contains multiple consecutive '-' signs, the function will treat the first '-' as a negative sign and ignore subsequent '-' signs, potentially leading to incorrect parsing.
- **Leading Non-Digit Characters:** If the input string `s` starts with non-digit characters, the function will skip these characters and start parsing from the first digit encountered.**

### Final State:
- `zero` remains 0.
- `s` is the byte string read from the standard input.
- `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise, it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged.
- `A` contains the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of any exception.
- `numb` is reset to 0.
- `sign` is reset to 1.
- `i` is the index at which the exception occurred or the length of `s`. **
