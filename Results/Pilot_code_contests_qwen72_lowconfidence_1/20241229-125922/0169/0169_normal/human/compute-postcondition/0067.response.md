To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run at least once. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `range(n - 1)` generates at least one value. This means `n - 1` must be greater than 0, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
   - `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1.
   - `temp` is 0.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1.
   - If `mini` is -1, then `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`.
   - `m` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it will be incremented by the loop.

### Final Adjusted State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `l1` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and at least one element in `l1` is -1, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, `maxi` is the maximum value among all elements in `l1` that are adjacent to a -1, if `mini` is -1 then `k` is 0 otherwise `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`, `m` is 0, `i` is 0**
