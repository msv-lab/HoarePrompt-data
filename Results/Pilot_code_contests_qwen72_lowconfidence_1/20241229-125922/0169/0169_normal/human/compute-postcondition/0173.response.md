The code snippet `l1[i] = k` updates the list `l1` at index `i` with the value of `k`. Given that `i` is 2 and `k` is 0, the third element in the list `l1` (index 2) will be set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers with `l1[2]` set to 0, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 2. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0. If `l1[3]` is -1, it is set to 0.**
