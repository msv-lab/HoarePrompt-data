The code snippet `flag = 1` changes the value of `flag` to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `flag` is 0 if `i` ≤ 0 or `l1[i - 1]` ≠ -1, and `flag` is 1 if `i` > 0 and `l1[i - 1]` == -1, setting `flag` to 1 overrides these conditions.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 1, `maxi` and `mini` are unchanged. If `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
