Postcondition: ***`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is `[0]`, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `i` is 0, `s[i] < b'0'[0]`, `s[i] != b'-'[0]`. If `s[i] != b'\r'[0]`, then `A` is `[0]` and all other variables retain their initial values.***
