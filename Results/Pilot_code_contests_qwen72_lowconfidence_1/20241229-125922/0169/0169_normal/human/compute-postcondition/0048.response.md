The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `zero`, which is an integer set to 0. It also implicitly processes a byte string `s` that represents a sequence of numbers and possibly a negative sign ('-'), where each number is separated by a non-digit character (excluding '\r'). The function returns a list `A` containing the signed numerical values parsed from `s` up to the point of any exception. If `s` is non-empty and the last character of `s` is greater than or equal to the ASCII value of '0', `A` includes an additional 0.
