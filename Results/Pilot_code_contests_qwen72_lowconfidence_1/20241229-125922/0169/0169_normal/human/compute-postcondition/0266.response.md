The code snippet provided is:

```
print(m, k)
```

This line prints the values of `m` and `k`. The values of these variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the state of the program remains the same except that the values of `m` and `k` are printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers where any `-1` in the list has been replaced by `k`, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the updated `l1`, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in the original `l1` that had a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in the original `l1` that had a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist). The values of `m` and `k` have been printed.**
