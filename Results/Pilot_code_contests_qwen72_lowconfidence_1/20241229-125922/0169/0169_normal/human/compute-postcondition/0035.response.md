The value of `numb` is set to `zero`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2, `numb` is 0, `sign` retains its initial value, `A` is now `[..., sign * numb]`**
