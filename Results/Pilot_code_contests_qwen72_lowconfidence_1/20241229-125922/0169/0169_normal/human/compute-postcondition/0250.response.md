The value of `l1[i]` is updated to `k`. Since `l1[i]` was initially `-1`, it now holds the value `k`. The values of `n`, `i`, `temp`, `count`, `m`, `mini`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input. If `l1[i + 1]` is `-1`, `l1[i + 1]` is updated to `k`. `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `m` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist), and `maxi` is the maximum of all elements in `l1` that have a `-1` in either the previous or next position (or -1 if no such elements exist). The current value of `l1[i]` is `k`.**
