Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is set to the minimum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`, `maxi` is set to the maximum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`, `flag` is 1 if `i > 0` and `l1[i - 1] == -1`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, the number of iterations remaining is `n - 1`. If `l1[i]` is -1, the current iteration is skipped, and the next iteration begins.***
