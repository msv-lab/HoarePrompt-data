The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within a loop.

Given the initial state, the `continue` statement will simply skip the rest of the current iteration, but since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this is part of an ongoing loop. The variables retain their values, and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 0, `maxi` and `mini` are unchanged, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
