The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables (`zero`, `s`, `conv`, `numb`, `sign`, and `A`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2, `numb` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition, `sign` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition, `A` retains its initial value as determined by the precondition.**
