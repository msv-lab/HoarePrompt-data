Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 0, `maxi` and `mini` remain as they were before the if-else block. If `l1[i]` is -1, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
