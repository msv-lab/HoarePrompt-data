The code snippet provided changes the value of the variable `sign` to 1. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise it is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `i` is 2, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1, `A` is now `[..., 1 * numb]`**
