The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `sign`. This changes the value of `sign` from its implicit initial state (which was not explicitly mentioned) to 1. The other variables (`zero`, `s`, `conv`, `A`, `numb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is a byte string representing a sequence of numbers and possibly a negative sign ('-'), where each number is separated by a non-digit character (excluding '\r'), `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0, `sign` is 1**
