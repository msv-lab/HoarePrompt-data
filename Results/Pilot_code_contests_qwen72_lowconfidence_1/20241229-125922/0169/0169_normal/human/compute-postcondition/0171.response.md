The code snippet `l1[i + 1] = k` updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `l1` to the value of `k`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `l1` is a list of integers.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`.
- `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined.
- `i` is 2.
- If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0.
- If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0.

The value of `i + 1` is `3`. Therefore, `l1[3]` is set to the value of `k`, which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers with `l1[3]` set to 0, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 2. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is also set to 0.**
