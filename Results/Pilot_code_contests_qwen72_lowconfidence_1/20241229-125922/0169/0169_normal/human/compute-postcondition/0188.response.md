The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end prematurely, and the control passes to the next iteration of the loop. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, the number of iterations remaining is `n`, `flag` is 0, and the first element of `l1` is -1. The current iteration is skipped.**
