The value of `numb` is assigned the value of `zero`, which is 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is a byte string representing a sequence of numbers and possibly a negative sign ('-'), where each number is separated by a non-digit character (excluding '\r'), `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0**
