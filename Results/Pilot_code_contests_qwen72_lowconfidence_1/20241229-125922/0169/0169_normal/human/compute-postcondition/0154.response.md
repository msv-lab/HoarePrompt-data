Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed. If `mini` is -1, indicating that no elements in `l1` are not `-1` and have at least one adjacent element equal to `-1`, `maxi` is also -1. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum value among all elements in `l1` that are not `-1` and have at least one adjacent element equal to `-1`, `maxi` is the maximum value among all such elements, and `k` is `(maxi + mini) // 2`.***
