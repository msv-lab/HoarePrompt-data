Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed. `mini` is -1, indicating that no elements in `l1` are not `-1` and have at least one adjacent element equal to `-1`. `maxi` is -1, as no such elements exist to determine a maximum value.**
