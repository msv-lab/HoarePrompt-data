The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow control within a loop.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 0, and the first element of `l1` is -1, and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
