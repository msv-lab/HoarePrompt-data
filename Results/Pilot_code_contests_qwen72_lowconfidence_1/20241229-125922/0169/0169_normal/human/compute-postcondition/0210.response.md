The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the control flow is affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `l1` is a list of integers based on the new input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `l1` list, `mini` is set to the minimum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`, `maxi` is set to the maximum of its original value (or `l1[0]` if it was -1) and `l1[0]`, `flag` is 0, the number of iterations remaining is `n - 1`. The current iteration is skipped, and the next iteration begins.**
