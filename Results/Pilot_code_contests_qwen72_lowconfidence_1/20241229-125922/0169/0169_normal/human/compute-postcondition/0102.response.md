The code snippet `flag = 1` changes the value of `flag` from 0 to 1. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of integers read from the input, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `mini` is -1, `maxi` is -1, `k` is 0, `m` is the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the modified `l1`, `m` and `k` have been printed, `flag` is 1. The first element of `l1` is -1, and `i` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i - 1` in `l1` is -1.**
