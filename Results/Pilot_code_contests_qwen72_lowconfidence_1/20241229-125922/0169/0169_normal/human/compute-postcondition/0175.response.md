The value of `m` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the absolute difference between `l1[i + 1]` and `l1[i]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `l1` is a list of integers.
- `temp` is 0.
- `count` is 0.
- `k` is 0.
- `m` is initially `max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0]))`.
- `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined.
- `i` is 2.
- If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0.
- If `l1[2]` is -1, it is set to 0.
- If `l1[3]` is -1, it is set to 0.

The new value of `m` is calculated as `max(abs(l1[i + 1] - l1[i]), m)`, which simplifies to `max(abs(l1[3] - l1[2]), m)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l1` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `count` is 0, `k` is 0, `m` is `max(abs(l1[3] - l1[2]), max(abs(l1[2] - l1[1]), abs(l1[1] - l1[0])))`, `mini` and `maxi` are as previously defined, `i` is 2. If `l1[1]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[2]` is -1, it is set to 0. If `l1[3]` is -1, it is set to 0.**
