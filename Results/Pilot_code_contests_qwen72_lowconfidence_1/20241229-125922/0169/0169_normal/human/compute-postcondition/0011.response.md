The value of `sign` is updated from 1 to -1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is 0, `s` is the byte string read from the standard input, `conv` is set to `ord` if `py2` is true, otherwise `conv` is a lambda function that returns its argument unchanged, `A` is an empty list, `numb` is 0, `sign` is -1, `i` is 0, `s[i] < b'0'[0]`, and `s[i]` is equal to the byte representation of `'-'` (i.e., `b'-'[0]`).**
