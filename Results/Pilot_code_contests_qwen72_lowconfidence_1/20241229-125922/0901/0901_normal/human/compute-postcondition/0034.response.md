Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`, and `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration. If `frnd` is already in `counter`, `counter[frnd]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter[frnd]` is set to 1.***
