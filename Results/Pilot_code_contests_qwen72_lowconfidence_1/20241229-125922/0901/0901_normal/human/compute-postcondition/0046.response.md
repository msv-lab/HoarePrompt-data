The code snippet `counter[frnd] = 1` updates the `counter` dictionary by setting the key `frnd` to the value 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are affected by this assignment.

- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `start_counting` remains 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `final_cnt` remains unchanged.
- `tmp_str` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces.
- `state` remains the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`.
- `i` remains `i_prev + 1`.
- `counter` now contains the key `frnd` with the value 1. If `state` is 1, `counter` was initially an empty dictionary; otherwise, it retains its previous contents with the addition of the new key-value pair.
- `frnd` remains `tmp_str[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is a dictionary with `frnd` set to 1 (and retains previous contents if `state` is not 1), `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`.**
