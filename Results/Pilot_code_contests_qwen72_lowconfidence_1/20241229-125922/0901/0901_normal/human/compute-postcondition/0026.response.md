The code snippet `final_cnt += max(counter.values())` updates the value of `final_cnt` by adding the maximum value found in the `counter` dictionary.

- `final_cnt` is incremented by the maximum value in `counter`.
- The initial state indicates that `counter` is a dictionary that was updated in the previous iteration, but the specific values in `counter` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `final_cnt`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `start_counting`, `tmp_str`, `state`, `i`, `frnd`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter`, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, and `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).**
