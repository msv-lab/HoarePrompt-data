The code `tmp_str = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `tmp_str`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `start_counting`, `counter`, `final_cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces**.
