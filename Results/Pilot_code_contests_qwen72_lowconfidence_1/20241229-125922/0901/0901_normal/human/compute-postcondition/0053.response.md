Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES'. If `counter` is non-empty, `final_cnt` is updated to include the maximum value in `counter`, and `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'. `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.***
