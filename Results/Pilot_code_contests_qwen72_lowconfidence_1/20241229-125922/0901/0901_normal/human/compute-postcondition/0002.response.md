The code initializes an empty dictionary named `counter`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `start_counting`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, while `counter` is now an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary**
