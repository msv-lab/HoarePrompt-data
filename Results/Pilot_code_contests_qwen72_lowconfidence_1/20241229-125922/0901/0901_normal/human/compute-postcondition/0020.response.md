The code `counter[frnd] = 1` updates the `counter` dictionary by adding a key-value pair where the key is `frnd` and the value is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is a dictionary with `counter[frnd] = 1`, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `state` is not equal to 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`, and `frnd` is in `counter`.**
