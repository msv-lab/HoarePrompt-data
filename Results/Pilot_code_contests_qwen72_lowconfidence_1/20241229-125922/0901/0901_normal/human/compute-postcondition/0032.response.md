The code snippet updates the count of `frnd` in the `counter` dictionary by incrementing its current value by 1. Since the exact values of `frnd` and `counter` before this operation are not specified, we can only state that the count associated with `frnd` in `counter` has been incremented.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration with `counter[frnd]` incremented by 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration with `counter[frnd]` incremented by 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`.**
