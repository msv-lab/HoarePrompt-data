`frnd` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `tmp_str`. All other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, and `state` is not equal to 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`**
