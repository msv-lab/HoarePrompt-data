Functionality: ** The function processes a series of events related to changes in Hiasat's handle and visits by friends. It takes two integers `n` and `m` as input, where `n` represents the number of events and `m` represents the number of friends. Each event is read from the standard input and can be one of two types: a handle change (state 1) or a friend visit (state 2). The function maintains a count of the maximum number of unique friends who visited Hiasat's profile between handle changes. After processing all events, it prints the total count of these maximum values. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where no handle changes occur, or where the last segment of events does not end with a handle change, both of which are handled correctly by the function. **
