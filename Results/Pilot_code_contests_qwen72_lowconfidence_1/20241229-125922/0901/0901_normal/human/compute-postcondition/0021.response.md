Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, and `state` is not equal to 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`. If `frnd` is already in `counter`, the value associated with `frnd` in `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter` is updated with `counter[frnd] = 1`, and `frnd` is added to `counter`.***
