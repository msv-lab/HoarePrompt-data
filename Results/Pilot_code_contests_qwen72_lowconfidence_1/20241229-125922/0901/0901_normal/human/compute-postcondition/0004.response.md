To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(0, n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer (but it does not affect the loop directly).
   - `start_counting` is 'NO' (this variable does not affect the loop directly).
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary (this variable does not affect the loop directly).
   - `final_cnt` is 0 (this variable does not affect the loop directly).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The other variables (`m`, `start_counting`, `counter`, `final_cnt`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not influence the loop's execution.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0. Here is the modified state:

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0**
