The function `func` processes inputs related to events and friends' names. It accepts the following parameters:

- An integer `n` representing the number of events, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- An integer `m` representing the number of friends, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 40.
- A list of strings representing the events. Each event is either a change to Hiasat's handle or a visit by a friend. The first event is always a handle change.
- A list of strings representing the names of the friends. Each friend's name is a string of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of 1 to 40 characters.

The function returns a list of strings indicating the current handle of Hiasat when each friend visited his profile. Each friend visits Hiasat's profile at least once.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of events and the number of friends, respectively, along with a list of events and a list of friends' names. It returns a list of strings indicating the current handle of Hiasat when each friend visited his profile.**
