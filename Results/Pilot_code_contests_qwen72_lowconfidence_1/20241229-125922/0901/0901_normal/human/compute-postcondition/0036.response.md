To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty and `start_counting` is 'YES', otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged.
- `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces.
- `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration.
- If `frnd` is already in `counter`, `counter[frnd]` is incremented by 1, otherwise, `counter[frnd]` is set to 1 if `state` is not 1.
- `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - `tmp_str` should be updated to the next input line split by spaces.
   - `state` should be updated to the integer value of the first element in `tmp_str`.
   - `counter` should be reset to an empty dictionary if `state` is 1.
   - `frnd` should be updated to `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
   - `start_counting` should be updated based on the new `state`.
   - `final_cnt` should be updated if `start_counting` is 'YES' and `counter` is not empty.

### Updated State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `tmp_str` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces.
- `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`.
- `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
- `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as the previous iteration.
- `final_cnt` is updated if `start_counting` is 'YES' and `counter` is not empty.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO'. `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty and `start_counting` is 'YES', otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged. `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration. If `frnd` is already in `counter`, `counter[frnd]` is incremented by 1, otherwise, `counter[frnd]` is set to 1 if `state` is not 1. `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the next input).**
