Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`, and `counter` is a dictionary where if `frnd` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `frnd` is added to `counter` with a value of 1.***
