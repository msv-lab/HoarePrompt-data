The code snippet `counter[frnd] += 1` updates the count for the key `frnd` in the dictionary `counter`. Since `counter` is initialized as an empty dictionary when `state` is 1, and `frnd` is derived from `tmp_str[1]`, the specific changes to the state are as follows:

- `counter[frnd]` is incremented by 1. If `frnd` was not already a key in `counter`, this operation adds `frnd` to `counter` with a value of 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `start_counting`, `final_cnt`, `tmp_str`, `state`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary with `frnd` (which is `tmp_str[1]`) incremented by 1, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`**.
