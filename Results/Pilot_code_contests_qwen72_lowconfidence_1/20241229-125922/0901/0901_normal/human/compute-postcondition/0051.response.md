Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' indicating that at least one `state` in the input lines was 1, `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES', `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1. Additionally, the current value of `start_counting` is 'YES', and the length of `counter` is greater than 0.***
