The code snippet `counter[frnd] = 1` updates the dictionary `counter` by setting the key `frnd` to the value 1. This impacts the `counter` dictionary, but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration with `counter[frnd] = 1`, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`**
