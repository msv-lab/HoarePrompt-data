Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, and `state` is 1. If `start_counting` is 'YES', then `start_counting` remains 'YES', and all other variables retain their initial values. Otherwise, `start_counting` remains 'NO', and all other variables retain their initial values.***
