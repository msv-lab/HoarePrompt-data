The code snippet sets `start_counting` to 'YES'. This change impacts the conditions under which `final_cnt` and `counter` are updated. Here's the detailed impact:

- `start_counting` is set to 'YES'.
- Since `start_counting` is now 'YES', `counter` will be initialized as an empty dictionary if it was not already.
- The condition for updating `final_cnt` will now be met if `counter` is not empty, as `start_counting` is 'YES'.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `final_cnt`, `tmp_str`, `state`, `i`, and `frnd` remain unchanged unless they depend on the updated `start_counting` or `counter`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty and `start_counting` is 'YES', otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary, and `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).**
