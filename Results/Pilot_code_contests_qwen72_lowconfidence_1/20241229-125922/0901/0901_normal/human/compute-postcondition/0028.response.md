The code snippet resets the `counter` dictionary to an empty dictionary. This impacts the `counter` variable directly, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty, otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).**
