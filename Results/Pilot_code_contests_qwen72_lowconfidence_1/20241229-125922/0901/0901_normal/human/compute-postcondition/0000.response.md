The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. These values represent the number of events and the number of friends, respectively. The constraints given in the initial state (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 40) are still valid after this operation.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process inputs representing events and friends' names, where the number of events `n` and the number of friends `m` are integers within the ranges 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 40. The events consist of changes to Hiasat's handle and visits by friends, with each friend's name being a string of lowercase Latin letters and having a length of 1 to 40 characters. The first event is always a handle change, and each friend visits Hiasat's profile at least once. `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
