The provided Python code snippet updates the `tmp_str` variable by assigning it the result of splitting the input line by spaces. The input line is obtained from the user through the `raw_input()` function. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]` (from the new input), `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, and `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).**
