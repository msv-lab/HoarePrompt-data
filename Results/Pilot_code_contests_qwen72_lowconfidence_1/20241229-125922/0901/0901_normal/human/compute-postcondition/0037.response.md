The provided Python code snippet reads a line from the input, splits it into parts, and updates several variables based on the input and the current state. Here's the detailed impact:

- `tmp_str` is assigned the list of strings resulting from splitting the next input line by spaces.
- `state` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `tmp_str`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i` becomes `i_prev + 1`).
- If `state` is 1, `counter` is reset to an empty dictionary, and `start_counting` is set to 'YES'.
- If `state` is not 1, `counter` is updated based on the second element in `tmp_str` (assigned to `frnd`), and `final_cnt` is potentially updated if `start_counting` is 'YES'.

Given the initial state and the provided code, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty and `start_counting` is 'YES', otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.**
