The code snippet assigns the second element of `tmp_str` (which is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces) to the variable `frnd`. This operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO'
- `final_cnt` is 0
- `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces
- `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration
- `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`**
