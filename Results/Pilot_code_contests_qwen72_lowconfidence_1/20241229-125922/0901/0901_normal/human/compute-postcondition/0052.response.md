The code snippet `final_cnt += max(counter.values())` updates the value of `final_cnt` by adding the maximum value found in the `counter` dictionary to its current value.

- `n` remains an input integer.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `start_counting` remains 'YES'.
- `final_cnt` is updated by adding the maximum value from `counter.values()` to its current value.
- `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'.
- `tmp_str` remains the list of the last input line split by spaces.
- `state` remains the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`.
- `frnd` remains the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
- The length of `counter` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES' plus the maximum value in `counter`, `counter` is a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES', `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1, and the length of `counter` is greater than 0.**
