The code snippet `final_cnt += max(counter.values())` updates the value of `final_cnt` by adding the maximum value found in the `counter` dictionary's values. Let's analyze the impact:

- `final_cnt` is updated by adding the maximum value from `counter.values()`.
- `counter` is either an empty dictionary (if `state` is 1) or a dictionary as updated in the previous iteration.
- If `counter` is empty, `max(counter.values())` will be 0, so `final_cnt` will remain unchanged.
- If `counter` is not empty, `final_cnt` will be updated by adding the maximum value from `counter`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `start_counting`, `tmp_str`, `state`, `i`, `frnd`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is updated by adding the maximum value from `counter`, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.**
