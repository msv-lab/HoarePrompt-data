The code snippet assigns the second element of the `tmp_str` list to the variable `frnd`. This impacts only the `frnd` variable, while the other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO'.
- `final_cnt` remains unchanged.
- `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces.
- `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration.
- `frnd` is now set to `tmp_str[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if `state` is 1, otherwise it remains either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` remains unchanged, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the next input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is an empty dictionary if `state` is 1, otherwise `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]`**.
