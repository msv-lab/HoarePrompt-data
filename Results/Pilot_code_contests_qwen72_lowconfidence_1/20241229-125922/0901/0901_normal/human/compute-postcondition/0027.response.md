Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the original `final_cnt` plus the maximum value in `counter` if `counter` is not empty, otherwise `final_cnt` remains unchanged. `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input line by spaces, `state` is the integer value of `tmp_str[0]`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `counter` is the dictionary as updated in the previous iteration, and `frnd` is `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1 (from the new input).***
