The code sets `start_counting` to 'YES'. Since the initial state specifies that if `start_counting` is 'YES', then `start_counting` remains 'YES', and all other variables retain their initial values, this condition is now met.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, and `state` is 1.**
