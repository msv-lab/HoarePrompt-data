The value of `final_cnt` is incremented by the maximum value found in the `counter` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `counter` is a non-empty dictionary, `max(counter.values())` will return the highest value among its values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is a non-empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is the maximum value in `counter` dictionary, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, `state` is 1**
