The code snippet assigns an empty dictionary to the variable `counter`. This overrides the initial state of `counter`, which could have been either an empty or a non-empty dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is an empty dictionary, `final_cnt` is 0, `tmp_str` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line by spaces, and `state` is 1.**
