You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process inputs representing events and friends' names, where the number of events `n` and the number of friends `m` are integers within the ranges 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 40. The events consist of changes to Hiasat's handle and visits by friends, with each friend's name being a string of lowercase Latin letters and having a length of 1 to 40 characters. The first event is always a handle change, and each friend visits Hiasat's profile at least once.
def func():
    n, m = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if any `state` in the input lines was 1, otherwise it remains 'NO', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is an empty dictionary if the last `state` is 1, otherwise it contains the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES', `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
    if (start_counting == 'YES') :
        if len(counter) :
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES'. If `counter` is non-empty, `final_cnt` is updated to include the maximum value in `counter`, and `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'. `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES'. If `start_counting` is 'YES', and `counter` is non-empty, `final_cnt` is updated to include the maximum value in `counter`, and `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'. `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1. If `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, and `final_cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(final_cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of events and the number of friends, respectively, along with a list of events and a list of friends' names. It returns a list of strings indicating the current handle of Hiasat when each friend visited his profile.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
