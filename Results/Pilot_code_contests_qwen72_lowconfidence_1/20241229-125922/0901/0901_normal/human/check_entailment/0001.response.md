Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where multiple friends visit Hiasat's profile between two handle change events correctly. Specifically, the program only counts the maximum number of visits for any single friend between handle change events, but it does not consider the possibility that multiple friends could be made happy by changing the handle to their names in sequence.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
1
2 alice
2 bob
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

### Explanation:
- At the first handle change event, Hiasat can change his handle to "alice".
- "alice" visits, and she is happy.
- "bob" visits, and he is not happy.
- At the second handle change event, Hiasat can change his handle to "bob".
- "alice" visits again, and she is not happy.
- "bob" visits again, and he is happy.

Thus, the maximum number of happy friends is 2 ("alice" and "bob"), but the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.
