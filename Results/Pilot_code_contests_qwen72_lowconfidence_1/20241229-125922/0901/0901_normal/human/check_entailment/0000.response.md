Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a friend visits Hiasat's profile multiple times between handle changes. The issue arises because the program only counts the occurrences of each friend visiting Hiasat's profile, but it does not consider the order of these visits in relation to the handle changes.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
1
2 alice
2 bob
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The first event is a handle change, so Hiasat can set his handle to any friend's name.
- The second event is a visit by `alice`, so Hiasat can set his handle to `alice` to make her happy.
- The third event is a visit by `bob`, so Hiasat can set his handle to `bob` to make him happy.
- The fourth event is another handle change, so Hiasat can again set his handle to any friend's name.
- The fifth event is another visit by `alice`, so Hiasat can keep his handle as `alice` to make her happy again.
- The sixth event is another visit by `bob`, so Hiasat can keep his handle as `bob` to make him happy again.

The optimal solution here is to set Hiasat's handle to `alice` after the first handle change and keep it as `alice` until the second handle change, then set it to `bob`. This way, both `alice` and `bob` will be happy.

However, the provided program only counts the number of visits and does not consider the order of visits and handle changes. As a result, it incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
