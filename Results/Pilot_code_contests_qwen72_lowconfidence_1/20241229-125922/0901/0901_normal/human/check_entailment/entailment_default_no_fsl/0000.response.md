Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed analysis of the issues:

1. **Handling of the First Handle Change**: The problem states that the first event is always of the first type (handle change), but the code does not handle this explicitly. It initializes `start_counting` to 'NO' and only sets it to 'YES' when a handle change event occurs. This means that the first handle change event is not treated differently, which could lead to incorrect counting.

2. **Counting Mechanism**: The code uses a dictionary `counter` to keep track of the number of times each friend visits Hiasat's profile between handle changes. However, the goal is to maximize the number of happy friends, not the number of visits. The code incorrectly adds the maximum number of visits (`max(counter.values())`) to `final_cnt`, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the number of unique happy friends.

3. **Final Count Calculation**: The code adds the maximum value from the `counter` dictionary to `final_cnt` after each handle change and at the end of the event list. This approach does not ensure that the maximum number of unique friends are made happy. Instead, it counts the friend with the most visits, which is not the same as maximizing the number of unique happy friends.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the following input:
```
5 3
1
2 motarack
2 mike
1
2 light
```
The expected output is `2` (as explained in the problem description), but the code will output `1` because it counts the maximum number of visits (`motarack` visits once, `mike` visits once, and `light` visits once) rather than the number of unique happy friends.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Track the set of friends who visit Hiasat's profile between handle changes.
2. When a handle change occurs, add the size of the set to the total count of happy friends.
3. Reset the set after each handle change.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    happy_friends = 0
    current_visitors = set()
    
    for _ in range(n):
        event = input().split()
        if event[0] == '1':
            happy_friends += len(current_visitors)
            current_visitors.clear()
        else:
            friend = event[1]
            current_visitors.add(friend)
    
    happy_friends += len(current_visitors)
    print(happy_friends)

func()
```

This corrected code ensures that the maximum number of unique happy friends is counted correctly.
