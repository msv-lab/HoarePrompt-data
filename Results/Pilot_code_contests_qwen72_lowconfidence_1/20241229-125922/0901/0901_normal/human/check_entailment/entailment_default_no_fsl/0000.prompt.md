You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle.

Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s visits Hiasat's profile. 



The friend s will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be s.

Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 40) — the number of events and the number of friends.

Then n lines follow, each denoting an event of one of two types: 

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40) visits Hiasat's profile. 



It's guaranteed, that each friend's name consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

It's guaranteed, that the first event is always of the first type and each friend will visit Hiasat's profile at least once.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of happy friends.

Examples

Input


5 3
1
2 motarack
2 mike
1
2 light


Output


2


Input


4 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
2 tanyaromanova


Output


1

Note

In the first example, the best way is to change the handle to the "motarack" in the first event and to the "light" in the fourth event. This way, "motarack" and "light" will be happy, but "mike" will not.

In the second example, you can choose either "alice", "bob" or "tanyaromanova" and only that friend will be happy.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
    if start_counting == 'YES':
        if len(counter):
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
    print(final_cnt)


```
Output hints: The function processes a series of events related to changes in Hiasat's handle and visits by friends. It takes two integers `n` and `m` as input, where `n` represents the number of events and `m` represents the number of friends. Each event is read from the standard input and can be one of two types: a handle change (state 1) or a friend visit (state 2). The function maintains a count of the maximum number of unique friends who visited Hiasat's profile between handle changes. After processing all events, it prints the total count of these maximum values. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where no handle changes occur, or where the last segment of events does not end with a handle change, both of which are handled correctly by the function.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
