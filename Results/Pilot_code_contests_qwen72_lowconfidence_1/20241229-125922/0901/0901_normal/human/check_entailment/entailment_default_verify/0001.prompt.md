You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle.

Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s visits Hiasat's profile. 



The friend s will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be s.

Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 40) — the number of events and the number of friends.

Then n lines follow, each denoting an event of one of two types: 

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40) visits Hiasat's profile. 



It's guaranteed, that each friend's name consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

It's guaranteed, that the first event is always of the first type and each friend will visit Hiasat's profile at least once.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of happy friends.

Examples

Input


5 3
1
2 motarack
2 mike
1
2 light


Output


2


Input


4 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
2 tanyaromanova


Output


1

Note

In the first example, the best way is to change the handle to the "motarack" in the first event and to the "light" in the fourth event. This way, "motarack" and "light" will be happy, but "mike" will not.

In the second example, you can choose either "alice", "bob" or "tanyaromanova" and only that friend will be happy.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
    if start_counting == 'YES':
        if len(counter):
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
    print(final_cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where multiple friends visit Hiasat's profile between two handle change events correctly. Specifically, the program only counts the maximum number of visits for any single friend between handle change events, but it does not consider the possibility that multiple friends could be made happy by changing the handle to their names in sequence.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
1
2 alice
2 bob
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

### Explanation:
- At the first handle change event, Hiasat can change his handle to "alice".
- "alice" visits, and she is happy.
- "bob" visits, and he is not happy.
- At the second handle change event, Hiasat can change his handle to "bob".
- "alice" visits again, and she is not happy.
- "bob" visits again, and he is happy.

Thus, the maximum number of happy friends is 2 ("alice" and "bob"), but the program outputs 1, which is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function processes a series of events related to changes in Hiasat's handle and visits by friends. It takes two integers `n` and `m` as input, where `n` represents the number of events and `m` represents the number of friends. Each event is read from the standard input and can be one of two types: a handle change (state 1) or a friend visit (state 2). The function maintains a count of the maximum number of unique friends who visited Hiasat's profile between handle changes. After processing all events, it prints the total count of these maximum values. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where no handle changes occur, or where the last segment of events does not end with a handle change, both of which are handled correctly by the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
