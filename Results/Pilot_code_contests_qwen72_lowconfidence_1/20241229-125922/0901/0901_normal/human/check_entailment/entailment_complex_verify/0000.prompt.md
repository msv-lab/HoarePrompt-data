You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle.

Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s visits Hiasat's profile. 



The friend s will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be s.

Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 40) — the number of events and the number of friends.

Then n lines follow, each denoting an event of one of two types: 

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40) visits Hiasat's profile. 



It's guaranteed, that each friend's name consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

It's guaranteed, that the first event is always of the first type and each friend will visit Hiasat's profile at least once.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of happy friends.

Examples

Input


5 3
1
2 motarack
2 mike
1
2 light


Output


2


Input


4 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
2 tanyaromanova


Output


1

Note

In the first example, the best way is to change the handle to the "motarack" in the first event and to the "light" in the fourth event. This way, "motarack" and "light" will be happy, but "mike" will not.

In the second example, you can choose either "alice", "bob" or "tanyaromanova" and only that friend will be happy.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
    if start_counting == 'YES':
        if len(counter):
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
    print(final_cnt)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a friend visits Hiasat's profile multiple times between handle changes. The issue arises because the program only counts the occurrences of each friend visiting Hiasat's profile, but it does not consider the order of these visits in relation to the handle changes.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
6 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
1
2 alice
2 bob
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The first event is a handle change, so Hiasat can set his handle to any friend's name.
- The second event is a visit by `alice`, so Hiasat can set his handle to `alice` to make her happy.
- The third event is a visit by `bob`, so Hiasat can set his handle to `bob` to make him happy.
- The fourth event is another handle change, so Hiasat can again set his handle to any friend's name.
- The fifth event is another visit by `alice`, so Hiasat can keep his handle as `alice` to make her happy again.
- The sixth event is another visit by `bob`, so Hiasat can keep his handle as `bob` to make him happy again.

The optimal solution here is to set Hiasat's handle to `alice` after the first handle change and keep it as `alice` until the second handle change, then set it to `bob`. This way, both `alice` and `bob` will be happy.

However, the provided program only counts the number of visits and does not consider the order of visits and handle changes. As a result, it incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process inputs representing events and friends' names, where the number of events `n` and the number of friends `m` are integers within the ranges 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 40. The events consist of changes to Hiasat's handle and visits by friends, with each friend's name being a string of lowercase Latin letters and having a length of 1 to 40 characters. The first event is always a handle change, and each friend visits Hiasat's profile at least once.
def func():
    n, m = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES' if any `state` in the input lines was 1, otherwise it remains 'NO', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES', `counter` is an empty dictionary if the last `state` is 1, otherwise it contains the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES', `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
    if (start_counting == 'YES') :
        if len(counter) :
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is 'YES', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES'. If `counter` is non-empty, `final_cnt` is updated to include the maximum value in `counter`, and `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'. `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `start_counting` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `final_cnt` is the sum of the maximum values in `counter` each time `state` is 1 and `start_counting` is 'YES'. If `start_counting` is 'YES', and `counter` is non-empty, `final_cnt` is updated to include the maximum value in `counter`, and `counter` remains a non-empty dictionary containing the counts of friends (if any) from the last segment of input where `start_counting` was 'YES'. `tmp_str` is the list of the last input line split by spaces, `state` is the integer value of the last `tmp_str[0]`, and `frnd` is the last friend string from `tmp_str[1]` if `state` is not 1. If `start_counting` is 'NO', `counter` is an empty dictionary, and `final_cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(final_cnt)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of events related to changes in Hiasat's handle and visits by friends. It takes two integers `n` and `m` as input, where `n` represents the number of events and `m` represents the number of friends. Each event is read from the standard input and can be one of two types: a handle change (state 1) or a friend visit (state 2). The function maintains a count of the maximum number of unique friends who visited Hiasat's profile between handle changes. After processing all events, it prints the total count of these maximum values. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly. Edge cases include scenarios where no handle changes occur, or where the last segment of events does not end with a handle change, both of which are handled correctly by the function.
