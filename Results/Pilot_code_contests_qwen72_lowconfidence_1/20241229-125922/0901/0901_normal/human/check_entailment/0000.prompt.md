You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Hiasat registered a new account in NeckoForces and when his friends found out about that, each one of them asked to use his name as Hiasat's handle.

Luckily for Hiasat, he can change his handle in some points in time. Also he knows the exact moments friends will visit his profile page. Formally, you are given a sequence of events of two types:

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s visits Hiasat's profile. 



The friend s will be happy, if each time he visits Hiasat's profile his handle would be s.

Hiasat asks you to help him, find the maximum possible number of happy friends he can get.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 40) — the number of events and the number of friends.

Then n lines follow, each denoting an event of one of two types: 

  * 1 — Hiasat can change his handle. 
  * 2 s — friend s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40) visits Hiasat's profile. 



It's guaranteed, that each friend's name consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

It's guaranteed, that the first event is always of the first type and each friend will visit Hiasat's profile at least once.

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of happy friends.

Examples

Input


5 3
1
2 motarack
2 mike
1
2 light


Output


2


Input


4 3
1
2 alice
2 bob
2 tanyaromanova


Output


1

Note

In the first example, the best way is to change the handle to the "motarack" in the first event and to the "light" in the fourth event. This way, "motarack" and "light" will be happy, but "mike" will not.

In the second example, you can choose either "alice", "bob" or "tanyaromanova" and only that friend will be happy.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    start_counting = 'NO'
    counter = {}
    final_cnt = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        tmp_str = raw_input().split()
        state = int(tmp_str[0])
        if state == 1:
            if start_counting == 'YES':
                if len(counter):
                    final_cnt += max(counter.values())
                counter = {}
            start_counting = 'YES'
        else:
            frnd = tmp_str[1]
            if frnd in counter:
                counter[frnd] += 1
            else:
                counter[frnd] = 1
    if start_counting == 'YES':
        if len(counter):
            final_cnt += max(counter.values())
    print(final_cnt)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
