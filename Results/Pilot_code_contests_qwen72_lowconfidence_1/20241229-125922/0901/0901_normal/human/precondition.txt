n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 40, representing the number of events and the number of friends, respectively. The events are represented as a list of n elements, where each element is either an integer 1 indicating Hiasat can change his handle, or a tuple (2, s) where s is a string representing a friend's name visiting Hiasat's profile. Each friend's name s consists only of lowercase Latin letters and has a length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 40. It is guaranteed that the first event is of the first type and each friend visits Hiasat's profile at least once.
