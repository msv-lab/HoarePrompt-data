The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0.
