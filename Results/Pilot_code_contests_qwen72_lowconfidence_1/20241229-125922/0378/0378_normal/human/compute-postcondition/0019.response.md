The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function expects two inputs: an integer `N` and a list `H` of integers. The integer `N` is within the range 1 to 20, inclusive, and `H` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer `H_i` is within the range 1 to 100, inclusive.

Since the function's output is not specified in the provided information, it is assumed that the function returns some result based on the inputs `N` and `H`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and a list `H` of `N` integers, where `1 <= N <= 20` and `1 <= H_i <= 100` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The exact return value is not specified, but it is based on the provided inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `N` and a list `H` of `N` integers, where `1 <= N <= 20` and `1 <= H_i <= 100` for all `i` from 1 to `N`. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
