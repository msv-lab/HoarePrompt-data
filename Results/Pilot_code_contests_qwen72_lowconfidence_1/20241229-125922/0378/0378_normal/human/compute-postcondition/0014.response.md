The value of `max` is assigned the value of `h`. Since `h` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it should be assumed that `h` refers to `H`, which is a list of `N` integers.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20
- `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one more item
- `max` is now a list of N integers, where each integer `max_i` is equal to `H_i`
- `ans` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one more item, `max` is a list of N integers where each integer `max_i` is equal to `H_i`, `ans` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
