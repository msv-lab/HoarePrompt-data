The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one item, `max` is `H_i`, `ans` is 1**
