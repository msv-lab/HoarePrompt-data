To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the items in the `inp` map object. For the loop to execute, `inp` must contain at least one item.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20
- `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input
- `max` is 0
- `ans` is 0

We need to ensure that `inp` is not empty for the loop to execute. Since `inp` is a map object, it must contain at least one key-value pair for the loop to iterate.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `inp` contains at least one item.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one item, `max` is 0, `ans` is 0**
