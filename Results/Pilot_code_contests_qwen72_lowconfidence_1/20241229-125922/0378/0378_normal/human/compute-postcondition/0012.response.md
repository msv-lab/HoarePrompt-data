Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least two items. If `max` is less than or equal to `h`, `max` is updated to `h` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged and `ans` is 1.***
