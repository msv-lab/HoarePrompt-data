The code snippet reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The `raw_input().strip()` function call reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and `int()` converts the stripped string to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20.
- H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100.

After executing the code:
- `n` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user, which must satisfy 1 <= n <= 20 (since it is intended to replace the value of N).

The state of `H` remains unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20**
