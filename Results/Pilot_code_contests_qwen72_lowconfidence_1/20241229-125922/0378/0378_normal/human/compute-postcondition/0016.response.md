Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one more item, `max` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `max` <= `h`, then `max` is updated to be a list of N integers where each integer `max_i` is equal to `H_i`, and `ans` is increased by 1.***
