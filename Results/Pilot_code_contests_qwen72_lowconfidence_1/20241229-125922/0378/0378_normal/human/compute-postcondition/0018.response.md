The provided code snippet only includes a print statement for the variable `ans`. This means that the value of `ans` is printed, but no changes are made to any variables or the program state.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20
- `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least `n` items
- `max` is the maximum value among the integers in `inp`
- `ans` is the number of times `max` was updated during the loop (i.e., the number of integers in `inp` that were greater than or equal to the previous `max`)
- If `inp` is empty, `max` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0

Since the code snippet does not modify any of these variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` is printed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least `n` items, `max` is the maximum value among the integers in `inp`, `ans` is the number of times `max` was updated during the loop, and `ans` is printed.**
