The provided code snippet initializes the variable `max` to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `N`, `H`, `n`, or `inp`.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input, `max` is 0.**
