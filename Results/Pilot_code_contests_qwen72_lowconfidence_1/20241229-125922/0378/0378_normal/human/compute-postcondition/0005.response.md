Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one item, `max` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `max` is less than or equal to the value of `h`***
