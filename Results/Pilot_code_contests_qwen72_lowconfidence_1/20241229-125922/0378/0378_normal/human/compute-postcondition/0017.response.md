Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least `n` items. `max` is the maximum value among the integers in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of times `max` was updated during the loop (i.e., the number of integers in `inp` that were greater than or equal to the previous `max`). If `inp` is empty, `max` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.**
