The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each part, converts each part to an integer, and maps these integers to the variable `inp`.

- The variable `N` remains an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20.
- The variable `H` remains a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- The new variable `inp` is now a map object that contains the integers read from the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input.**
