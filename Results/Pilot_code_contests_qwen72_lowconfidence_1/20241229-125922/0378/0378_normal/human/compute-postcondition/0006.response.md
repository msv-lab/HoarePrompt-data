The code snippet `max = h` assigns the value of `h` to the variable `max`. Given that `h` is part of the list `H` (denoted as `H_i`), the variable `max` now holds the value of `H_i`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20
- `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one item
- `max` is now equal to `H_i`
- `ans` is 0

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least one item, `max` is `H_i`, `ans` is 0**
