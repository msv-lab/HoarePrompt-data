Functionality: ** The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Empty Input List:** The function assumes that the input list will always contain `N` integers, but if the input list is somehow empty (which should not happen given the constraints), the function will still print 0.
- **Input Validation:** The function does not validate the input to ensure that `N` is within the specified range (1 <= N <= 20) or that the integers in the list are within the range (1 <= H_i <= 100). If invalid input is provided, the behavior of the function is undefined.
- **Non-integer Input:** The function uses `raw_input().strip()` and `map(int, ...)` to read and convert the input. If the input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised, causing the function to fail.
