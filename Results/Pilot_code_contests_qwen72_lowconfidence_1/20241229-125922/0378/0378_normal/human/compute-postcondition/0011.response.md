The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was 1 if `max` was updated, otherwise it was 0. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is 2 if `max` was updated, otherwise it is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least two items, `max` is equal to `h`, `ans` is 2 if `max` was updated, otherwise `ans` is 1**
