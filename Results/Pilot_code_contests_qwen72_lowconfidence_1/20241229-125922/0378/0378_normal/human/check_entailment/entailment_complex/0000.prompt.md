You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.

At the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.

The height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.

You can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.

For the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \leq H_i, H_2 \leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \leq H_i.

From how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 20
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N


Output

Print the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, and H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    inp = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    max = 0
    ans = 0
    for h in inp:
        if max <= h:
            max = h
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least `n` items. `max` is the maximum value among the integers in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of times `max` was updated during the loop (i.e., the number of integers in `inp` that were greater than or equal to the previous `max`). If `inp` is empty, `max` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
