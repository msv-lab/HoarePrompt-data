Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of mountains.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the heights of the mountains.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `max` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the maximum height encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. This variable will count the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

3. **Loop through Heights:**
   - The program iterates through each height in the list `inp`.
   - For each height `h`, it checks if `h` is greater than or equal to the current maximum height (`max`).
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `max`, it updates `max` to `h` and increments `ans` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

### Why the Program Meets the Problem Description:

- **Initial Condition:** The program correctly initializes `max` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
- **Loop Logic:** The loop correctly checks if the current height `h` is greater than or equal to the current maximum height `max`. If it is, it updates `max` and increments `ans`.
- **Correct Counting:** The program counts the number of inns from which you can see the ocean by checking if the current height is greater than or equal to all previous heights.
- **Output:** The program prints the correct count of inns from which you can see the ocean.

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Mountain:** If there is only one mountain, the program will correctly count it as visible because the initial `max` is 0.
- **All Mountains of the Same Height:** If all mountains have the same height, the program will correctly count all inns as visible because each height will be equal to the previous maximum.
- **Empty List:** Although the problem constraints guarantee that `N` is at least 1, the program would still handle an empty list correctly by printing 0, as `max` and `ans` remain 0.

Given that the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles the edge cases correctly, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
