Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of mountains \( N \) and the heights of the mountains \( H \) from standard input.
   - It uses `raw_input().strip()` to read and strip any leading/trailing whitespace from the input lines.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `max` and `ans` are initialized to 0. `max` keeps track of the maximum height encountered so far, and `ans` counts the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

3. **Loop Through Heights**:
   - The program iterates through each height \( h \) in the list `inp`.
   - For each height \( h \), it checks if \( h \) is greater than or equal to the current maximum height (`max`).
   - If \( h \) is greater than or equal to `max`, it updates `max` to \( h \) and increments `ans` by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling the First Mountain**: The first mountain is always visible because there are no other mountains to the west of it. The program correctly handles this by initializing `max` to 0, ensuring that the first height will always be greater than or equal to `max`.

- **Subsequent Mountains**: For each subsequent mountain, the program checks if the current height is greater than or equal to all previous heights. This is done by comparing the current height with the current maximum height (`max`). If the current height is greater than or equal to `max`, it means the current inn can see the ocean, and the program updates `max` and increments `ans`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all heights are the same, the program will count all inns as visible because each height will be equal to the maximum height seen so far.
  - If the heights are strictly decreasing, the program will count only the first inn as visible because no subsequent inn will be taller than the first one.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `4\n6 5 6 8`
  - Heights: `[6, 5, 6, 8]`
  - Steps:
    - First mountain: \( 6 \geq 0 \) (True), `max = 6`, `ans = 1`
    - Second mountain: \( 5 \geq 6 \) (False), `max = 6`, `ans = 1`
    - Third mountain: \( 6 \geq 6 \) (True), `max = 6`, `ans = 2`
    - Fourth mountain: \( 8 \geq 6 \) (True), `max = 8`, `ans = 3`
  - Output: `3`

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `5\n4 5 3 5 4`
  - Heights: `[4, 5, 3, 5, 4]`
  - Steps:
    - First mountain: \( 4 \geq 0 \) (True), `max = 4`, `ans = 1`
    - Second mountain: \( 5 \geq 4 \) (True), `max = 5`, `ans = 2`
    - Third mountain: \( 3 \geq 5 \) (False), `max = 5`, `ans = 2`
    - Fourth mountain: \( 5 \geq 5 \) (True), `max = 5`, `ans = 3`
    - Fifth mountain: \( 4 \geq 5 \) (False), `max = 5`, `ans = 3`
  - Output: `3`

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `5\n9 5 6 8 4`
  - Heights: `[9, 5, 6, 8, 4]`
  - Steps:
    - First mountain: \( 9 \geq 0 \) (True), `max = 9`, `ans = 1`
    - Second mountain: \( 5 \geq 9 \) (False), `max = 9`, `ans = 1`
    - Third mountain: \( 6 \geq 9 \) (False), `max = 9`, `ans = 1`
    - Fourth mountain: \( 8 \geq 9 \) (False), `max = 9`, `ans = 1`
    - Fifth mountain: \( 4 \geq 9 \) (False), `max = 9`, `ans = 1`
  - Output: `1`

The program correctly counts the number of inns from which you can see the ocean for all valid inputs, meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
