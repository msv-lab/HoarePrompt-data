You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.

At the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.

The height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.

You can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.

For the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \leq H_i, H_2 \leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \leq H_i.

From how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 20
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N

Print the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    inp = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    max = 0
    ans = 0
    for h in inp:
        if max <= h:
            max = h
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly updates the `max` variable before checking if the current height `h` allows seeing the ocean. According to the problem statement, an inn at the i-th mountain can see the ocean if and only if the height of the i-th mountain is greater than or equal to all previous mountains' heights. However, the program updates the `max` variable immediately after the check, which means it will always count the first mountain that is higher than the current `max`, regardless of whether it meets the condition for all previous mountains.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:
```
5
1 3 2 4 3
```
Expected output: `2` (inns on the 2nd and 4th mountains can see the ocean).

Actual output: `3` (inns on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mountains are counted).

The program incorrectly counts the 3rd mountain because it updates the `max` variable before ensuring that the current mountain's height is greater than or equal to all previous mountains' heights. To fix this, the `max` variable should be updated after the `ans` increment, but only if the current height `h` is indeed greater than or equal to all previous heights.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, and H is a list of N integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    inp = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    max = 0
    ans = 0
    for h in inp:
        if max <= h:
            max = h
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 20, `H` is a list of N integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies 1 <= `H_i` <= 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `inp` is a map object containing integers read from the input and must contain at least `n` items. `max` is the maximum value among the integers in `inp`, and `ans` is the number of times `max` was updated during the loop (i.e., the number of integers in `inp` that were greater than or equal to the previous `max`). If `inp` is empty, `max` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
