Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers representing the heights of the mountains.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `max` to 0 and `ans` to 0. These variables are used to keep track of the maximum height encountered so far and the count of inns from which the ocean can be seen, respectively.
3. **Iteration and Comparison**: The function iterates through each height in the list. For each height `h`:
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to the current `max`, it updates `max` to `h` and increments `ans` by 1.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

This logic ensures that the function counts the number of inns from which the ocean can be seen correctly. The condition `if max <= h` ensures that only those inns where the height is greater than or equal to all previous heights are counted, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the code handles all potential cases correctly:
- For the input `4\n6 5 6 8`, the output is `3` (inns at heights 6, 6, and 8).
- For the input `5\n4 5 3 5 4`, the output is `3` (inns at heights 4, 5, and 5).
- For the input `5\n9 5 6 8 4`, the output is `1` (only the inn at height 9).

Since the code meets the requirements for all given examples and logically handles all potential cases within the constraints, it is correct.
