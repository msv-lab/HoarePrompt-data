Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program incorrectly updates the `max` variable before checking if the current height `h` allows seeing the ocean. According to the problem statement, an inn at the i-th mountain can see the ocean if and only if the height of the i-th mountain is greater than or equal to all previous mountains' heights. However, the program updates the `max` variable immediately after the check, which means it will always count the first mountain that is higher than the current `max`, regardless of whether it meets the condition for all previous mountains.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:
```
5
1 3 2 4 3
```
Expected output: `2` (inns on the 2nd and 4th mountains can see the ocean).

Actual output: `3` (inns on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th mountains are counted).

The program incorrectly counts the 3rd mountain because it updates the `max` variable before ensuring that the current mountain's height is greater than or equal to all previous mountains' heights. To fix this, the `max` variable should be updated after the `ans` increment, but only if the current height `h` is indeed greater than or equal to all previous heights.
