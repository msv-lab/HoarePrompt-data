You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.

At the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.

The height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.

You can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.

For the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \leq H_i, H_2 \leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \leq H_i.

From how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 20
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N


Output

Print the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

Examples

6 5 6 8

Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    inp = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    max = 0
    ans = 0
    for h in inp:
        if max <= h:
            max = h
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the heights of the mountains are such that no inn can see the ocean except the first one. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

In this case, only the first inn can see the ocean because it is the highest point when moving from west to east. However, the program will output `5`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly increments the answer for every mountain that is higher than the previous maximum, but it should only count those inns that are visible from the ocean according to the problem description. 

The correct logic should ensure that an inn is counted only if it is the highest seen so far from the west, not just if it is higher than the previous one.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
