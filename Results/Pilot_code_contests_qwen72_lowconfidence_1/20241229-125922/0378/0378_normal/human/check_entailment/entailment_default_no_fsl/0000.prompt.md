You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N mountains ranging from east to west, and an ocean to the west.

At the top of each mountain, there is an inn. You have decided to choose where to stay from these inns.

The height of the i-th mountain from the west is H_i.

You can certainly see the ocean from the inn at the top of the westmost mountain.

For the inn at the top of the i-th mountain from the west (i = 2, 3, ..., N), you can see the ocean if and only if H_1 \leq H_i, H_2 \leq H_i, ..., and H_{i-1} \leq H_i.

From how many of these N inns can you see the ocean?

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 20
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
H_1 H_2 ... H_N


Output

Print the number of inns from which you can see the ocean.

Examples

Program:
```
import sys
import math

def func():
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    inp = map(int, raw_input().strip().split(' '))
    max = 0
    ans = 0
    for h in inp:
        if max <= h:
            max = h
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input: the first line is an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 20), and the second line is a space-separated list of `N` integers (1 <= H_i <= 100). It then calculates the number of integers in the list that are greater than or equal to the current maximum value encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. The function prints this count and does not return any value. If the input list is empty, the function prints 0.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
