Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the problem, an inn can see the ocean if its height is greater than or equal to the heights of all previous inns. However, the program simply counts the number of inns whose height is greater than or equal to the maximum height encountered so far, starting from the beginning of the list. This means the program will incorrectly count inns that cannot see the ocean.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 3 5 4
```
The correct output should be 3 because only the inns at heights 4, 5, and 5 can see the ocean. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The issue arises because the program does not check if the current inn's height is greater than or equal to all previous inns' heights, but rather just checks if it is greater than or equal to the maximum height encountered so far. This leads to incorrect counting in cases where the heights are not monotonically increasing.
