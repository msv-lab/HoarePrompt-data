Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the heights of the mountains are such that no inn can see the ocean except the first one. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

In this case, only the first inn can see the ocean because it is the highest point when moving from west to east. However, the program will output `5`, which is incorrect. The program incorrectly increments the answer for every mountain that is higher than the previous maximum, but it should only count those inns that are visible from the ocean according to the problem description. 

The correct logic should ensure that an inn is counted only if it is the highest seen so far from the west, not just if it is higher than the previous one.
