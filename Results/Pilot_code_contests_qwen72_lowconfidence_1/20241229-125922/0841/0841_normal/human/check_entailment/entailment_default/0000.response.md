Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program provided appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` from standard input, which is then converted into a list of its digits in reverse order. This is necessary to process the digits from the least significant to the most significant, which is crucial for handling carry-over operations correctly.

2. **Processing Digits**:
   - For each digit `d` in the reversed list, the program adds the current carry-over value `c` to `d`.
   - If the resulting value `d + c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5, it adds `10 - d` to the sum `s` and sets `c` to 1. This ensures that the change is minimized by rounding up to the next higher multiple of 10.
   - Otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: After processing all digits, the program adds the final carry-over value `c` to `s` and calls `func_2` with the result.

4. **Output**: The `func_2` function is responsible for printing the result. It takes care of formatting and writing the output to the specified stream (or `sys.stdout` by default).

### Edge Cases:
- **Very Large Integers**: The program handles very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) by processing the digits one by one, which is efficient and avoids memory issues.
- **Carry-Over Behavior**: The carry-over logic is correctly implemented to ensure that the sum is minimized while accounting for the need to round up when necessary.

### Verification:
- **Example 1**: For `N = 36`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of banknotes as 8.
- **Example 2**: For `N = 91`, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of banknotes as 3.
- **Example 3**: For a very large `N` (as provided in the third example), the program correctly calculates the minimum number of banknotes as 243.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
