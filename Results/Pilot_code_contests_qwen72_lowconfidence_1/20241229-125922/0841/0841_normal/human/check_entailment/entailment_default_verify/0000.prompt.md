You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the Kingdom of AtCoder, only banknotes are used as currency. There are 10^{100}+1 kinds of banknotes, with the values of 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \dots, 10^{(10^{100})}. You have come shopping at a mall and are now buying a takoyaki machine with a value of N. (Takoyaki is the name of a Japanese snack.)

To make the payment, you will choose some amount of money which is at least N and give it to the clerk. Then, the clerk gives you back the change, which is the amount of money you give minus N.

What will be the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, when both choose the combination of banknotes to minimize this count?

Assume that you have sufficient numbers of banknotes, and so does the clerk.

Constraints

* N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive).

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N


Output

Print the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk.

Program:

from __future__ import division, print_function
import os

from io import BytesIO, IOBase
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = [int(i) for i in input()][::-1]
    s = c = 0
    for i in range(len(n)):
        d = n[i] + c
        c = 0
        if d > 5 or (d == 5 and i + 1 < len(n) and (n[i + 1] + 1 > 5)):

            c = 1
        else:

        file.write(str(x))

    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem by breaking down the number `N` into its individual digits and applying a rounding strategy, but this approach does not correctly compute the minimum number of banknotes needed for the transaction. 

A clear example where the program fails is:

**Input:**
```
91
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

The correct solution would involve giving 100 (a single banknote) and receiving 9 back (one 10 note and one 1 note), resulting in a total of 3 banknotes used. However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic and will likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` prints the elements of a tuple `args` to a specified output stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. The elements are separated by a string `sep` (defaulting to a space ' '), and an `end` string (defaulting to a newline '\n') is appended after the last element. The function also supports an optional `flush` parameter, which, if set to `True`, forces the output stream to flush immediately. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, no output is produced except for the `end` string. If `file` is not provided or is not a valid object with a `write` method, the function will raise an exception. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' if they are present.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
