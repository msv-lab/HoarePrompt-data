Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program breaks down the number `N` into its individual digits and applies a rounding strategy, but this approach does not correctly compute the minimum number of banknotes needed for the transaction.

For example, with the input `91`, the expected output is `3` because the optimal solution involves giving 100 (a single banknote) and receiving 9 back (one 10 note and one 1 note), resulting in a total of 3 banknotes used. However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario and will likely produce an incorrect result.

The output hints for `func_2` confirm that it is a simple printing function and does not affect the correctness of the main logic in `func_1`. Therefore, the issue lies in the core logic of `func_1`, which does not align with the problem requirements. Hence, the program is incorrect.
