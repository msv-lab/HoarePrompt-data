Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The input `N` is read and converted into a list of its digits in reverse order. This allows the program to process each digit from the least significant to the most significant, which is necessary for the carry-over logic.

2. **Carry-Over Logic**: The program processes each digit `d` along with a carry-over value `c`. It checks if `d + c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5. If these conditions are met, it adds `10 - d` to the sum `s` and sets the carry-over `c` to 1. Otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0. This logic ensures that the minimum number of banknotes is used for both the payment and the change.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: After processing all digits, the program adds the final carry-over value `c` to the sum `s` and passes this sum to `func_2`.

4. **Output**: The function `func_2` prints the final sum `s + c` to the standard output. This function handles the printing correctly, including optional parameters for separator, end character, and flushing the output stream.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) by converting them into a list of digits and processing each digit individually. The carry-over logic ensures that the correct number of banknotes is counted even for the last digit.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The examples provided in the problem description (36, 91, and a very large number) are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
