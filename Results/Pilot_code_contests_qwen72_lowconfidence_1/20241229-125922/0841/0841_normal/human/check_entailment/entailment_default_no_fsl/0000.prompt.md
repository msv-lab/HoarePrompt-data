You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the Kingdom of AtCoder, only banknotes are used as currency. There are 10^{100}+1 kinds of banknotes, with the values of 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \dots, 10^{(10^{100})}. You have come shopping at a mall and are now buying a takoyaki machine with a value of N. (Takoyaki is the name of a Japanese snack.)

To make the payment, you will choose some amount of money which is at least N and give it to the clerk. Then, the clerk gives you back the change, which is the amount of money you give minus N.

What will be the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, when both choose the combination of banknotes to minimize this count?

Assume that you have sufficient numbers of banknotes, and so does the clerk.

Constraints

* N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive).

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N


Output

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from standard input, converts `N` into a list of its digits in reverse order, and processes this list to compute a sum `s` based on specific conditions. For each digit `d` in the list, if `d` plus a carry-over value `c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5, it adds `10 - d` to `s` and sets `c` to 1; otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0. After processing all digits, it calls `func_2` with the final sum `s` plus the carry-over value `c`. The function does not return any value directly; instead, it invokes `func_2` with the computed result. Edge cases include handling very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) and ensuring correct carry-over behavior for the last digit.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` prints the elements of a tuple `args` to a specified output stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. The elements are separated by a string `sep` (defaulting to a space ' '), and an `end` string (defaulting to a newline '\n') is appended after the last element. The function also supports an optional `flush` parameter, which, if set to `True`, forces the output stream to flush immediately. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, no output is produced except for the `end` string. If `file` is not provided or is not a valid object with a `write` method, the function will raise an exception. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' if they are present.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
