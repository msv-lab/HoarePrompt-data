Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:** A single integer \( N \) (1 ≤ \( N \) ≤ \( 10^{1,000,000} \)).
2. **Output:** The minimum number of banknotes used by both the customer and the clerk to complete the transaction.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the input \( N \) as a string and converts it into a list of its digits in reverse order. This is done using the line:
     ```python
     n = [int(i) for i in input()][::-1]
     ```
   - This step ensures that the digits are processed from the least significant to the most significant, which is crucial for the subsequent logic.

2. **Processing Digits:**
   - The program iterates over the digits of \( N \) and calculates the minimum number of banknotes required to make up the total amount and the change.
   - For each digit \( d \) in the reversed list, the program checks if adding the carry \( c \) results in a value greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit (if it exists) plus 1 is greater than 5. If so, it adds \( 10 - d \) to the sum \( s \) and sets the carry \( c \) to 1. Otherwise, it adds \( d \) to \( s \) and keeps the carry \( c \) as 0.
   - This logic ensures that the program minimizes the number of banknotes used by either giving exact change or using the smallest number of higher-value banknotes.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After processing all digits, the program adds the final carry \( c \) to the sum \( s \) and passes the result to `func_2` for printing.
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for printing the result to the standard output.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
- It ensures that the minimum number of banknotes is used by considering the optimal way to give and receive change.
- The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
