You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the Kingdom of AtCoder, only banknotes are used as currency. There are 10^{100}+1 kinds of banknotes, with the values of 1, 10, 10^2, 10^3, \dots, 10^{(10^{100})}. You have come shopping at a mall and are now buying a takoyaki machine with a value of N. (Takoyaki is the name of a Japanese snack.)

To make the payment, you will choose some amount of money which is at least N and give it to the clerk. Then, the clerk gives you back the change, which is the amount of money you give minus N.

What will be the minimum possible number of total banknotes used by you and the clerk, when both choose the combination of banknotes to minimize this count?

Assume that you have sufficient numbers of banknotes, and so does the clerk.

Constraints

* N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive).

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are used in the function `func_1`. The function reads an integer N from standard input, where N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive). The function processes N by converting it into a list of its digits in reverse order, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9.
def func_1():
    n = [int(i) for i in input()][::-1]
    s = c = 0
    for i in range(len(n)):
        d = n[i] + c
        
        c = 0
        
        if d > 5 or d == 5 and i + 1 < len(n) and n[i + 1] + 1 > 5:
            s += 10 - d
            c = 1
        else:
            s += d
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input number `N` in reverse order, `s` is the sum of the adjusted values of the digits in `n` based on the loop conditions, and `c` is the carry-over value after the last iteration, which is 0 or 1.
    func_2(s + c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from standard input, converts `N` into a list of its digits in reverse order, and processes this list to compute a sum `s` based on specific conditions. For each digit `d` in the list, if `d` plus a carry-over value `c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5, it adds `10 - d` to `s` and sets `c` to 1; otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0. After processing all digits, it calls `func_2` with the final sum `s` plus the carry-over value `c`. The function does not return any value directly; instead, it invokes `func_2` with the computed result. Edge cases include handling very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) and ensuring correct carry-over behavior for the last digit.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any type of values, and kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values, 'file' is an object with a write method to which the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. If `args` is not empty, the string representation of each element in `args` has been written to `file`, separated by `sep` (except before the first element). If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'end' was present, it has been removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `file` now contains the value of `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'` appended to its previous content. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the elements of a tuple `args` to a specified output stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. The elements are separated by a string `sep` (defaulting to a space ' '), and an `end` string (defaulting to a newline '\n') is appended after the last element. The function also supports an optional `flush` parameter, which, if set to `True`, forces the output stream to flush immediately. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, no output is produced except for the `end` string. If `file` is not provided or is not a valid object with a `write` method, the function will raise an exception. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' if they are present.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
