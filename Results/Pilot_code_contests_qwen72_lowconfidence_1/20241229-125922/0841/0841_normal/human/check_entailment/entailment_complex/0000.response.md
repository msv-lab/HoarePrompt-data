Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the case where the input number `N` ends in a 5 and the next digit would also require a carry-over. This can lead to an incorrect total number of banknotes used.

For example, consider the input `N = 15`. The correct output should be 2 because the optimal way to pay is to use one 10-banknote and get one 5-banknote back as change. However, the current implementation of `func_1` will incorrectly handle this case:

1. The digits of `15` in reverse order are `[5, 1]`.
2. For the first digit `5`, the condition `if d > 5 or d == 5 and i + 1 < len(n) and n[i + 1] + 1 > 5` evaluates to `False` because `d == 5` and `n[i + 1] + 1 == 2` (which is not greater than 5).
3. Therefore, it adds `5` to `s` and sets `c` to `0`.
4. For the second digit `1`, it adds `1` to `s` and sets `c` to `0`.

The final sum `s` is `6`, and adding the carry `c` results in `6`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2`.

This example shows that the program does not correctly handle the edge case where a 5 is followed by a digit that would also require a carry-over, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
