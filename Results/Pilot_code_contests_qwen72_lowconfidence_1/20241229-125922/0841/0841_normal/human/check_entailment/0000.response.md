Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem by breaking down the number `N` into its individual digits and applying a rounding strategy, but this approach does not correctly compute the minimum number of banknotes needed for the transaction. 

A clear example where the program fails is:

**Input:**
```
91
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

The correct solution would involve giving 100 (a single banknote) and receiving 9 back (one 10 note and one 1 note), resulting in a total of 3 banknotes used. However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic and will likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
