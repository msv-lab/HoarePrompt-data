#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are used in the function `func_1`. The function reads an integer N from standard input, where N is an integer between 1 and 10^{1,000,000} (inclusive). The function processes N by converting it into a list of its digits in reverse order, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9.
def func_1():
    n = [int(i) for i in input()][::-1]
    s = c = 0
    for i in range(len(n)):
        d = n[i] + c
        
        c = 0
        
        if d > 5 or d == 5 and i + 1 < len(n) and n[i + 1] + 1 > 5:
            s += 10 - d
            c = 1
        else:
            s += d
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input number `N` in reverse order, `s` is the sum of the adjusted values of the digits in `n` based on the loop conditions, and `c` is the carry-over value after the last iteration, which is 0 or 1.
    func_2(s + c)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from standard input, converts `N` into a list of its digits in reverse order, and processes this list to compute a sum `s` based on specific conditions. For each digit `d` in the list, if `d` plus a carry-over value `c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5, it adds `10 - d` to `s` and sets `c` to 1; otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0. After processing all digits, it calls `func_2` with the final sum `s` plus the carry-over value `c`. The function does not return any value directly; instead, it invokes `func_2` with the computed result. Edge cases include handling very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) and ensuring correct carry-over behavior for the last digit.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any type of values, and kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' is a string used to separate the values, 'file' is an object with a write method to which the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. If `args` is not empty, the string representation of each element in `args` has been written to `file`, separated by `sep` (except before the first element). If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'end' was present, it has been removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `file` now contains the value of `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'` appended to its previous content. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` prints the elements of a tuple `args` to a specified output stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. The elements are separated by a string `sep` (defaulting to a space ' '), and an `end` string (defaulting to a newline '\n') is appended after the last element. The function also supports an optional `flush` parameter, which, if set to `True`, forces the output stream to flush immediately. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, no output is produced except for the `end` string. If `file` is not provided or is not a valid object with a `write` method, the function will raise an exception. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' if they are present.
