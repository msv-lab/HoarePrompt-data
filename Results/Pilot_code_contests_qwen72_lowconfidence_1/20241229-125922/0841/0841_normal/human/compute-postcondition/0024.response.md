The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it accepts two parameters: `args` and `kwargs`. `args` is a tuple that can contain any type of values, and `kwargs` is a dictionary that can contain optional parameters: 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. The 'sep' parameter is a string used to separate the values, 'file' is an object with a write method to which the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream. The function does not return any value (it likely performs some form of output operation).

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `args` of any type of values and a dictionary `kwargs` containing optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. It uses these parameters to perform an output operation, where 'sep' is a string used to separate the values, 'file' is an object with a write method to which the output will be written, 'end' is a string appended after the last value, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream. The function does not return a value.**
