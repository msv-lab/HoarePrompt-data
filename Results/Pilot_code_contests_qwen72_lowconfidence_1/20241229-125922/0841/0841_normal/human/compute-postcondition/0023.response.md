Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'end' was present, it has been removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `file` now contains the value of `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'` appended to its previous content. If `kwargs['flush']` is `True`, the output buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
