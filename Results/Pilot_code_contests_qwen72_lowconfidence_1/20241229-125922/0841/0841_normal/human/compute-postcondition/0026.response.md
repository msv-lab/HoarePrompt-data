The function `func_2` is called with the argument `s + c`. This means that the sum of the adjusted values of the digits in `n` (`s`) and the carry-over value (`c`) is passed to `func_2`.

- `s` and `c` are not modified by this line of code.
- The function `func_2` might modify `s` and `c` or other variables, but since we don't have the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes. However, we can say that the function is called with the argument `s + c`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input number `N` in reverse order, `s` is the sum of the adjusted values of the digits in `n` based on the loop conditions, `c` is the carry-over value after the last iteration, which is 0 or 1, and `func_2(s + c)` has been called.**
