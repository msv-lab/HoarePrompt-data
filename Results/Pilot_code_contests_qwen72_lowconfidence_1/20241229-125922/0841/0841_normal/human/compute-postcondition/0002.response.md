The given code snippet is:

```python
at_start = True
```

This line of code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `at_start`. There are no other variables or conditions mentioned that are affected by this assignment.

Given the Initial State:

- `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs'.
- `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs'.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'sep' or 'file' were present, they are removed).
- `args` is a tuple of any type of values.

The only change introduced by the code snippet is the assignment of `True` to `at_start`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'sep' or 'file' were present, they are removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `True`.**
