The code `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` writes the value of `kwargs['end']` to the `file` object, or if `'end'` is not in `kwargs`, it writes `'\n'` (a newline character) to `file`. Additionally, the key `'end'` is removed from the `kwargs` dictionary if it exists.

- `args` remains unchanged.
- `kwargs` loses the key `'end'` if it was present.
- `sep` and `file` remain unchanged unless `'end'` was in `kwargs` and it was the same object as `sep` or `file`, which is unlikely.
- `at_start` remains unchanged.
- The `file` object now contains the additional content written by `write`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'end' was present, it has been removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, `file` now contains the value of `kwargs['end']` or `'\n'` appended to its previous content.**
