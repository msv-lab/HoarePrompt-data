The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `N` from standard input, where `N` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{1,000,000}\) (inclusive). The function processes `N` by converting it into a list of its digits in reverse order, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9. The function returns this list of digits.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `N` from standard input, converts `N` into a list of its digits in reverse order, and returns this list.**
