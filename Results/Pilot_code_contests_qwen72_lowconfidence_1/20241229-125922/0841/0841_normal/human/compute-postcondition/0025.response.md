Functionality: ** The function `func_2` prints the elements of a tuple `args` to a specified output stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. The elements are separated by a string `sep` (defaulting to a space ' '), and an `end` string (defaulting to a newline '\n') is appended after the last element. The function also supports an optional `flush` parameter, which, if set to `True`, forces the output stream to flush immediately. The function does not return any value. If `args` is empty, no output is produced except for the `end` string. If `file` is not provided or is not a valid object with a `write` method, the function will raise an exception. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys 'sep', 'end', and 'flush' if they are present. **
