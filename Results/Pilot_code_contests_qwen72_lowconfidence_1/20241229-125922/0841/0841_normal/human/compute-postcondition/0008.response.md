The code snippet sets `at_start` to `False`. This affects the condition for writing `sep` to `file` in future operations. Since the code only modifies `at_start`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values that must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, the string representation of `x` has been written to `file`.**
