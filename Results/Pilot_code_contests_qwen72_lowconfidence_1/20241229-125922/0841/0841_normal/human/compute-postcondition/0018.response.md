The code `at_start = False` sets the variable `at_start` to `False`. This changes the value of `at_start` from its initial state, which was not specified but is now explicitly `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values that must contain at least two elements, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` contains the string representation of the next `x` appended to its previous content, possibly followed by `sep` if `at_start` was `False`, and now `at_start` is `False`.**
