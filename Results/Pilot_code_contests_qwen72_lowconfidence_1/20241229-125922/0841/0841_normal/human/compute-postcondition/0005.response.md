`file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. The value of `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, and `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`. The current value of `at_start` remains `False`. The values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, and `file` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values that must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
