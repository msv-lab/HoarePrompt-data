Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any type of values that must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`. If `at_start` is `False`, `sep` has been written to `file`. Otherwise, `at_start` remains `True` and no changes are made to `file`.***
