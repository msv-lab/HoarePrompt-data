The code snippet extracts the 'sep' and 'file' values from the `kwargs` dictionary, using default values if these keys are not present. The default value for 'sep' is a single space (' '), and the default value for 'file' is `sys.stdout`.

- `sep` is assigned the value of `kwargs['sep']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise, it defaults to ' ' (a single space).
- `file` is assigned the value of `kwargs['file']` if it exists in `kwargs`, otherwise, it defaults to `sys.stdout`.
- The keys 'sep' and 'file' are removed from `kwargs` if they were present.

Therefore, the Output State is: **args is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush' (if 'sep' or 'file' were present, they are removed), `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`.**
