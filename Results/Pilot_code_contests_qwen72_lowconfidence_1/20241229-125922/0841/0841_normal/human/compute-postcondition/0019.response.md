Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value from `kwargs['sep']` or ' ' if 'sep' was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value from `kwargs['file']` or `sys.stdout` if 'file' was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` is not empty, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. If `args` is not empty, the string representation of each element in `args` has been written to `file`, separated by `sep` (except before the first element). If `args` is empty, nothing is written to `file`.**
