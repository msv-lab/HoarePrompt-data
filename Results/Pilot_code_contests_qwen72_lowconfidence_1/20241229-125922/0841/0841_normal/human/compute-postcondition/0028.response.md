Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from standard input, converts `N` into a list of its digits in reverse order, and processes this list to compute a sum `s` based on specific conditions. For each digit `d` in the list, if `d` plus a carry-over value `c` is greater than 5 or equal to 5 and the next digit plus 1 is greater than 5, it adds `10 - d` to `s` and sets `c` to 1; otherwise, it adds `d` to `s` and resets `c` to 0. After processing all digits, it calls `func_2` with the final sum `s` plus the carry-over value `c`. The function does not return any value directly; instead, it invokes `func_2` with the computed result. Edge cases include handling very large integers (up to 1,000,000 digits) and ensuring correct carry-over behavior for the last digit. **
