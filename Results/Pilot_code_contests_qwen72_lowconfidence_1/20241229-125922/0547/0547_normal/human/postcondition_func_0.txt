The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers representing skill levels. It then attempts to increase the skill levels in the list such that the last digit of each skill level becomes 0, using up to `k` total increments. The function sorts the skill levels based on their last digit in descending order before making the adjustments. After the adjustments, the function prints the sum of the skill levels divided by 10. If an `IOError` occurs during input, the function silently catches the error and does nothing further. The final state is that `n` remains a non-negative integer, `k` is the remaining value after adjustments, and `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented to make the last digit 0, with the rest sorted based on the last digit in descending order.
