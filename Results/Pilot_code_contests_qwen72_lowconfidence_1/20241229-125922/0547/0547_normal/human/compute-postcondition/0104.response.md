Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `delta` (10 - `nums[0]` % 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums[i]` is 100, the program continues with the current state.***
