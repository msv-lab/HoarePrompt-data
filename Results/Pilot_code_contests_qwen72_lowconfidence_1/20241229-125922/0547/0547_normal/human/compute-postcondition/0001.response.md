The code snippet `n, k = int(n), int(k)` converts the values of `n` and `k` to integers. Since `n` and `k` were already described as the first and second integers from the input respectively, this conversion ensures they are explicitly treated as integers in subsequent operations.

The list of `n` integers `ai` remains unchanged, as it was not directly affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`**
