To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k - 10`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills.
- `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `10 - nums[0] % 10`, making `nums[1]` a multiple of 10.
- `i` is 1.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `delta` is 10.
- The loop breaks if `k < 10`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 10`.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been modified.
   - `stop` is `False`.
   - `delta` is 10.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `nums`, `stop`, `delta`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

4. **Break Condition**:
   - The loop will break if `k < 10`.
   - Since `k` is `k - 10` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than or equal to 10 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The other variables remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 10`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `10 - nums[0] % 10`, `nums[1]` is now a multiple of 10, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `delta` is 10. If `k < 10`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
