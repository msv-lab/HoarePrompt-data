The code snippet `nums = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which are stored in the variable `nums`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the list of integers `ai` is not directly affected by this code. However, `nums` now holds the split input, which could be related to the list of integers `ai`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 â‰¤ ai â‰¤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`, `nums` is a list of strings from the input**.
