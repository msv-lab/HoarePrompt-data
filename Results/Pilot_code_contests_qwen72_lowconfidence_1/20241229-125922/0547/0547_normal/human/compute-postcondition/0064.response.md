The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it affects the flow control within the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills
- `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order
- `i` is 1
- `stop` is False
- `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`
- If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

After executing the `continue` statement, the state remains unchanged except for the fact that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + (10 - nums[0] % 10)` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 1, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`, and the next iteration of the loop will be executed.**
