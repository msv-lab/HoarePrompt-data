The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. It does not alter the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings and sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is True, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`, and `k` is less than `delta`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
