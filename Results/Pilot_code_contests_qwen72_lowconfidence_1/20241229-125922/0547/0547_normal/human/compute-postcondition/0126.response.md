An `IOError` might be triggered when the program attempts to read input using `raw_input()`. This could happen if there is an issue with the input stream, such as the input being closed or if the input operation is interrupted.

Here’s a step-by-step summary of what the `try`-`except` statement accomplishes:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program attempts to read two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers `nums` from the input.

2. **Processing the List:**
   - The list `nums` is sorted based on the last digit of each element in descending order.
   - A loop runs to adjust the elements in `nums`:
     - For each element, if `k` is greater than 0 and the element is less than 100, it calculates the `delta` needed to make the last digit 10.
     - If `k` is sufficient, it increments the element by `delta` and decreases `k` by `delta`.
     - The loop continues until no further adjustments can be made or `k` is exhausted.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - After the adjustments, the program prints the sum of the quotients of each element in `nums` divided by 10.

4. **Handling Exceptions:**
   - If an `IOError` occurs during the input operations, the `except` block catches it and the program continues without printing the result or making further adjustments.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the remaining value after attempting to adjust all eligible elements in `nums`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta` (making the last digit 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is `True` if no further adjustments can be made, otherwise `False`. If an `IOError` occurs, the state is unknown and no further processing is done.**
