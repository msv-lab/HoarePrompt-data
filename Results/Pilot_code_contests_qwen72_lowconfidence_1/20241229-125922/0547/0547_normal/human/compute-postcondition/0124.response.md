The code snippet prints the sum of the quotients when each element in the list `nums` is divided by 10. This operation does not alter any variables or their values; it only performs a calculation and outputs the result.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the remaining value after attempting to adjust all eligible elements in `nums`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta` (making the last digit 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is `True` if no further adjustments can be made, otherwise `False`. The sum of the quotients of each element in `nums` divided by 10 has been printed.**
