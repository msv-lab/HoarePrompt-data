Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 10`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `10 - nums[0] % 10`, `nums[1]` is now a multiple of 10, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `delta` is 10, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
