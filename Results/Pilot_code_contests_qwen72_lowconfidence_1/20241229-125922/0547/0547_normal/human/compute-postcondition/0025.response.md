The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the next iteration of the loop will start.

Given the initial state, the output state after executing the `continue` statement is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`, and the next iteration of the loop will start.**
