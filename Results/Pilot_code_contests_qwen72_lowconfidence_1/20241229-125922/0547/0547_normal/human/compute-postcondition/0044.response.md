Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of deltas for all modified elements, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False if any modifications were made, otherwise `stop` remains True.**
