Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is the remaining value after attempting to adjust all eligible elements in `nums` (where `nums[i]` was less than 100 and the adjustment did not exceed the available `k`), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta` (making the last digit 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is `True` if no further adjustments can be made, otherwise `False`.**
