Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + (10 - nums[0] % 10)` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 2, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] + delta`, `n` must be greater than 2. If `nums[i]` is 100, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `k` is 0 at any point, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
