Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[1] % 10) - (10 - nums[1] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the second element is `nums[1] + delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`. If `nums[i]` is 100, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
