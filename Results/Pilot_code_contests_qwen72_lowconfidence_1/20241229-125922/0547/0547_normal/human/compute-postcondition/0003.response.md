The code snippet converts each string element in the `nums` list to an integer. The `nums` list, which was initially a list of strings, is now a list of integers.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 â‰¤ ai â‰¤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`, `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings**.
