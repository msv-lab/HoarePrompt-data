Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[2] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + (10 - nums[0] % 10)` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 2, `stop` is False, `delta` is 0, `nums[2]` is now a multiple of 10, `n` must be greater than 2. If `k` is less than `delta`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
