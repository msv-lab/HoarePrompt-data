The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[i] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + (10 - nums[0] % 10)` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 2, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[i] % 10`, `nums[i]` is now `nums[i] + delta`, `n` must be greater than 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
