The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is affected. Since the initial state indicates that `k` is evaluated to determine whether to break out of the loop, and `continue` is encountered, the loop will proceed to the next iteration without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `delta` (10 - `nums[0]` % 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 1, `stop` is `False`, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
