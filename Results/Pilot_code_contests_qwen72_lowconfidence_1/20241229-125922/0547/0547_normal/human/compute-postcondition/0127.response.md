The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of integers. Here, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 107, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100.

The function returns the maximum possible sum of the skill levels after increasing any number of skill levels by at most `k` total increments, where each increment increases a skill level by 1.
