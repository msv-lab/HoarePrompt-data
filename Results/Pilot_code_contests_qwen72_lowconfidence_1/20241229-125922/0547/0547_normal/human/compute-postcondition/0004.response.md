The provided code snippet sorts the `nums` list using a custom comparison function. This comparison function sorts the numbers based on the remainder when divided by 10, in descending order. The sorting operation modifies the `nums` list in place.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively.
- `a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`.
- `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings.

After executing the code snippet, the `nums` list will be sorted based on the last digit of each number in descending order.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers representing the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`, `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings and sorted based on the last digit in descending order**.
