The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is affected. Since the `continue` statement is encountered, the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing any further code within the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings and sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is True. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `nums[i]` is 100. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
