The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables in the current iteration. The state of the program remains the same except for the fact that the next iteration will start immediately.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of deltas for all modified elements
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills
- `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order
- `i` is 0
- `stop` is True
- If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement
- The current value of `nums[i]` is 100

The `continue` statement does not change any of these conditions. The only effect is that the next iteration of the loop will begin.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of deltas for all modified elements, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 0, `stop` is True, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, the current value of `nums[i]` is 100, and the next iteration of the loop will start immediately.**
