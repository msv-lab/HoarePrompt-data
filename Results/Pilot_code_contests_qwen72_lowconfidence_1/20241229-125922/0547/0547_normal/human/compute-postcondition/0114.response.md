The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and the next iteration to begin immediately. This does not alter the values of any variables directly, but it does affect the flow control within the loop. The variables retain their values, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration unless conditions outside this snippet cause a different behavior.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 10`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element has been incremented by `10 - nums[0] % 10`, `nums[1]` is now a multiple of 10, `i` is 2, `stop` is `False`, `delta` is 10. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The loop proceeds to the next iteration.**
