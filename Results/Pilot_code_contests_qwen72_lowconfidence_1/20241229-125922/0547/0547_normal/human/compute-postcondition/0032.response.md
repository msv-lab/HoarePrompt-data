The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `delta` from its current value. The value of `delta` is defined as `10 - nums[1] % 10`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[1] % 10) - (10 - nums[1] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the second element is `nums[1] + delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`.**
