Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers converted from the input strings and sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is True. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
