The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly, but it affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is the remaining value after attempting to adjust all eligible elements in `nums`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta` (making the last digit 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `nums[i]` is 100. We skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration.**
