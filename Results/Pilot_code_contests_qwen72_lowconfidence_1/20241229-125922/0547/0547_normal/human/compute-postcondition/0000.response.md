The code snippet reads two values from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The input is expected to be a single line containing two space-separated integers. After this assignment, `n` and `k` will hold these new values, and the list of integers `ai` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the first and second integers from the input respectively, `a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the levels of the character's skills`**
