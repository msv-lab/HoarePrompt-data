Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is the remaining value after attempting to adjust all eligible elements in `nums`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where each element that was less than 100 and could be increased by `delta` without exceeding `k` has been incremented by its respective `delta` (making the last digit 10), and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `i` is 0, `stop` is `True`, `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`, `k` is less than `delta`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
