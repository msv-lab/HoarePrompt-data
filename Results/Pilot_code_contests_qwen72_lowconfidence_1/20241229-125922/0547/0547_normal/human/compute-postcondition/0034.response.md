The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently executing within. Since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly mentioned in the context, we assume this is part of such a structure. The values of the variables do not change due to the `break` statement itself.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[1] % 10) - (10 - nums[1] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the second element is `nums[1] + delta`, and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False, `delta` is `10 - nums[1] % 10`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
