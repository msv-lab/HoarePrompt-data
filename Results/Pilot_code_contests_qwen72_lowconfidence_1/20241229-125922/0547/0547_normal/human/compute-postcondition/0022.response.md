To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills
- `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order
- `stop` is False
- `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`k`, `a`, `nums`, `stop`, and `delta`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 1.
- All other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (10 - nums[0] % 10)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 100) represents the levels of the character's skills, `nums` is a list of integers where the first element is now `nums[0] + delta` and the rest of the elements are sorted based on the last digit in descending order, `stop` is False, and `delta` is `10 - nums[0] % 10`**.
