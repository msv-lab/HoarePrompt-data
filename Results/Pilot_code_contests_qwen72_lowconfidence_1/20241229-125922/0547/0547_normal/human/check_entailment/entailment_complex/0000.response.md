Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This discrepancy means the program will not run correctly in Python 3 environments, which is a common environment for modern Python code.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The program sorts the skills based on the last digit (`b % 10 - a % 10`). However, this sorting logic is not optimal for maximizing the total rating. The optimal strategy involves increasing skills that are closer to the next multiple of 10, as these will contribute more to the total rating per unit spent. The current sorting logic does not prioritize skills that are closer to the next multiple of 10 effectively.

3. **Increment Logic**: The program increments skills by `10 - nums[i] % 10` to make the last digit 0. This is generally correct, but the program does not handle cases where the remaining `k` is less than the required `delta` correctly. Specifically, it breaks out of the loop without considering whether there might be other skills that could benefit from the remaining `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if all skills are already at 100, the program should not attempt to increment them and should directly calculate the total rating.

### Corrected Approach
To ensure the program meets the problem description, the following changes are necessary:

1. **Use `input()` for Python 3 compatibility**.
2. **Sort skills based on the distance to the next multiple of 10**.
3. **Handle the remaining `k` correctly**.
4. **Ensure no unnecessary increments are made**.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Sort skills based on the distance to the next multiple of 10
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: 10 - x % 10)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if nums[i] == 100:
            continue
        delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10
        if k >= delta:
            nums[i] += delta
            k -= delta
        else:
            nums[i] += k
            k = 0
            break
    
    # Calculate the total rating
    total_rating = sum(num // 10 for num in nums)
    print(total_rating)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
1. **Input Handling**: Uses `input()` and `map(int, ...)` to read and convert input values.
2. **Sorting Logic**: Sorts skills based on the distance to the next multiple of 10 (`10 - x % 10`).
3. **Increment Logic**: Increments skills by the required amount or the remaining `k`, whichever is smaller.
4. **Total Rating Calculation**: Calculates the total rating by summing the integer division of each skill by 10.

This corrected program ensures that it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
