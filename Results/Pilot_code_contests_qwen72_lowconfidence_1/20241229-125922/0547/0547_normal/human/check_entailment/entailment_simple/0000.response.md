Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Sorting and Comparison Function**:
   - The program uses `nums.sort(cmp=lambda a, b: b % 10 - a % 10)` to sort the skills based on their last digit in descending order. However, this approach is not optimal for maximizing the total rating. The correct approach should prioritize skills that are closer to the next multiple of 10, as these will yield the highest increase in rating per improvement unit.

2. **Improvement Units Usage**:
   - The program attempts to increment each skill by the smallest amount needed to reach the next multiple of 10 (`delta = 10 - nums[i] % 10`). While this is a good start, it does not consider the possibility of using the remaining improvement units to further increase the skills beyond the next multiple of 10, which could potentially lead to a higher total rating.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the remaining improvement units can be used to increase skills beyond the next multiple of 10. For example, if a skill is already at 90 and there are enough improvement units to reach 100, the program should use those units to maximize the rating.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - The final output is calculated using `print(sum([(num / 10) for num in nums]))`. This is correct, but it assumes that the skills have been optimally increased, which is not guaranteed by the current logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Sort the skills based on the distance to the next multiple of 10.
2. Use the improvement units to increment skills to the next multiple of 10, starting with the skills that are closest to the next multiple.
3. After reaching the next multiple of 10, if there are still improvement units left, use them to further increase the skills up to 100.
4. Calculate the final total rating by summing the integer division of each skill by 10.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def max_rating():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the distance to the next multiple of 10 for each skill
    distances = [(10 - num % 10, num) for num in nums if num < 100]
    distances.sort()  # Sort by the distance to the next multiple of 10
    
    for distance, num in distances:
        if k >= distance:
            k -= distance
            nums[nums.index(num)] += distance
        else:
            break
    
    # Use remaining improvement units to further increase skills
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if k > 0 and nums[i] < 100:
            increment = min(k, 100 - nums[i])
            nums[i] += increment
            k -= increment
    
    # Calculate the final total rating
    total_rating = sum(num // 10 for num in nums)
    print(total_rating)

# Example usage
max_rating()
```

This solution ensures that the improvement units are used optimally to maximize the total rating of the character, as required by the problem description.
