You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Recently, Masha was presented with a chessboard with a height of n and a width of m.

The rows on the chessboard are numbered from 1 to n from bottom to top. The columns are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Therefore, each cell can be specified with the coordinates (x,y), where x is the column number, and y is the row number (do not mix up).

Let us call a rectangle with coordinates (a,b,c,d) a rectangle lower left point of which has coordinates (a,b), and the upper right one — (c,d).

The chessboard is painted black and white as follows:

<image> An example of a chessboard.

Masha was very happy with the gift and, therefore, invited her friends Maxim and Denis to show off. The guys decided to make her a treat — they bought her a can of white and a can of black paint, so that if the old board deteriorates, it can be repainted. When they came to Masha, something unpleasant happened: first, Maxim went over the threshold and spilled white paint on the rectangle (x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2). Then after him Denis spilled black paint on the rectangle (x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4).

To spill paint of color color onto a certain rectangle means that all the cells that belong to the given rectangle become color. The cell dyeing is superimposed on each other (if at first some cell is spilled with white paint and then with black one, then its color will be black).

Masha was shocked! She drove away from the guests and decided to find out how spoiled the gift was. For this, she needs to know the number of cells of white and black color. Help her find these numbers!

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases.

Each of them is described in the following format:

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n,m ≤ 10^9) — the size of the board.

The second line contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 ≤ x_2 ≤ m, 1 ≤ y_1 ≤ y_2 ≤ n) — the coordinates of the rectangle, the white paint was spilled on.

The third line contains four integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 (1 ≤ x_3 ≤ x_4 ≤ m, 1 ≤ y_3 ≤ y_4 ≤ n) — the coordinates of the rectangle, the black paint was spilled on.

Output

Output t lines, each of which contains two numbers — the number of white and black cells after spilling paint, respectively.

Note

Explanation for examples:

The first picture of each illustration shows how the field looked before the dyes were spilled. The second picture of each illustration shows how the field looked after Maxim spoiled white dye (the rectangle on which the dye was spilled is highlighted with red). The third picture in each illustration shows how the field looked after Denis spoiled black dye (the rectangle on which the dye was spilled is highlighted with red).

In the first test, the paint on the field changed as follows:

In the second test, the paint on the field changed as follows:

In the third test, the paint on the field changed as follows:

In the fourth test, the paint on the field changed as follows:
