The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, where `x` is an integer and `r` is a positive integer. It returns the integer division result of `(x + r - 1)` divided by `r`. This effectively rounds up the division of `x` by `r` to the nearest whole number. For example, if `x = 5` and `r = 3`, the function returns `2` because `(5 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2`. The function handles all valid integer inputs for `x` and positive integer inputs for `r`. If `r` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined and may lead to errors or incorrect results.
