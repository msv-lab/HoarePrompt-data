The function `func_3` reads four non-negative integers from the standard input, where the sum of these integers is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5. It returns a list containing these four integers. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., fewer or more than four integers, or integers that do not satisfy the sum condition), the behavior is undefined.
