The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both of the inputs are 0, returning the non-zero value or 0 if both are 0.
