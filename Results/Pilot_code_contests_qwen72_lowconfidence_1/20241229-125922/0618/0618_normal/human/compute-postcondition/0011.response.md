The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. Let's evaluate the impact of this change on the variables and conditions:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + d \leq 10^5\).
   - They have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `s1` is equal to `b - a`.
   - `s2` is equal to `c - d`.
   - `s1` is not equal to `s2`.
   - The current value of `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`.
   - `a` is equal to 0.

2. **Impact of `c -= 1`:**
   - The value of `c` is decremented by 1.
   - This affects `s2` because `s2` is defined as `c - d`.

3. **Calculating New Values:**
   - `c` is now `c - 1`.
   - `s2` is now `(c - 1) - d`, which simplifies to `c - d - 1`.

4. **Updating Conditions:**
   - The new value of `s2` is `s2 - 1`.
   - The condition `s1 + 1` is still equal to the new `s2`:
     - Original condition: `s1 + 1 = s2`.
     - New condition: `s1 + 1 = (s2 - 1)`.
     - Simplifying: `s1 + 1 = s2 - 1` implies `s1 + 2 = s2`.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `a` remains 0.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `c` is now `c - 1`.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `s1` remains `b - a`.
   - `s2` is now `s2 - 1`.
   - The condition `s1 + 2` is now equal to `s2`.

Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is unchanged, `c` is `c - 1`, `d` is unchanged, `s1` is `b - a`, `s2` is `s2 - 1`, `s1 + 2` is equal to `s2`**.
