Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both of the inputs are 0, returning the non-zero value or 0 if both are 0. **

Explanation:
- The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of `x` and `y`.
- The loop continues until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD.
- If `y` is 0 initially, the function returns `x` as the GCD.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, the function returns 0, which is the correct GCD for this edge case.
