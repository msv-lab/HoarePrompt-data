To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the variables `x` and `y` over multiple iterations until the loop condition `y` becomes false (i.e., `y` becomes 0).

### Initial State:
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `y` is a non-negative integer, and for the loop to execute at least once, `y` must be greater than 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
while y:
    x, y = y, x % y
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - Before the loop: `x` is some non-negative integer, `y` is some positive integer.
   - After the first iteration: `x` is assigned the original value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - Before the second iteration: `x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.
   - After the second iteration: `x` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`, and `y` is the remainder of the previous `x` (which was the original `y`) divided by the previous `y` (which was the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`).

3. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - The loop continues to execute as long as `y` is not zero. Each iteration updates `x` to the current value of `y` and `y` to the remainder of the current `x` divided by the current `y`.

### Termination Condition:
- The loop terminates when `y` becomes 0. At this point, `x` holds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop has executed, `y` will be 0.
- `x` will hold the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.

### Output State:
**`y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.**
