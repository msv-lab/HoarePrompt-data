To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

### Initial State Recap:
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + (d - 1) \leq 10^5\).
- `d` is now `d - 1`.
- `s1` is equal to `b - a`.
- `s2` is equal to `c - (d - 1)`.
- `s1` is not equal to `s2`.
- `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`.
- `s1` is equal to `s2 + 1`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
out = [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]
```

1. **`[1, 0] * a`**:
   - This creates a list that repeats `[1, 0]` `a` times.
   - For example, if `a = 2`, this would produce `[1, 0, 1, 0]`.

2. **`[1, 2] * (b - a)`**:
   - This creates a list that repeats `[1, 2]` `(b - a)` times.
   - For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 5`, this would produce `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.

3. **`[3, 2] * d`**:
   - This creates a list that repeats `[3, 2]` `d` times.
   - Note that `d` has been decremented by 1, so we use `d - 1` in the calculations.
   - For example, if `d = 3` (initially), this would produce `[3, 2, 3, 2]` because `d` is now `2`.

4. **`[3]`**:
   - This appends the single element `3` to the end of the list.

### Combining the Lists:
- The final list `out` is the concatenation of the lists generated from the above steps.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `a = 2`
- `b = 5`
- `c = 4`
- `d = 3` (initially, so `d - 1 = 2` after decrement)

1. **`[1, 0] * 2`**:
   - Produces `[1, 0, 1, 0]`.

2. **`[1, 2] * (5 - 2)`**:
   - Produces `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.

3. **`[3, 2] * 2`**:
   - Produces `[3, 2, 3, 2]`.

4. **`[3]`**:
   - Appends `3` to the end.

Combining these, the final list `out` is:
\[ [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3] \]

### Output State:
The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged except for the decrement of `d`. The conditions `s1` and `s2` also remain valid. The new variable `out` is created.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + (d - 1) \leq 10^5\), `d` is now `d - 1`, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - (d - 1)`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1` is equal to `s2 + 1`, `out` is a list constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]`.**
