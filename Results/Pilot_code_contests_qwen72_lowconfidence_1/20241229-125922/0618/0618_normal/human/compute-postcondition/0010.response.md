Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d â‰¤ 10^5, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`. `s1` is not equal to `s2`. The current value of `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`. Additionally, `a` is equal to 0.***
