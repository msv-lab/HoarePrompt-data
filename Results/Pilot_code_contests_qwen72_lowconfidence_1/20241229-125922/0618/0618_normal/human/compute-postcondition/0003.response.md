The code snippet `x, y = y, x % y` swaps the values of `x` and `y` such that the new value of `x` is the original value of `y`, and the new value of `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

- Initially, `x` is the original value of `y`.
- Initially, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

After executing the code:

- The new value of `x` becomes the original value of `y`.
- The new value of `y` becomes the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

Output State: **`x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.**
