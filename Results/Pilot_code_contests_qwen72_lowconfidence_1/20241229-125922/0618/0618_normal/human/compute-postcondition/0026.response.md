Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + d \leq 10^5\), and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `s1` is not equal to `s2`. If `s1 + 1 == s2`, then: 
- If `a > 0`, `s1` is equal to `b - a + 1`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, the current value of `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`, and `out` is a list constructed as `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d` with a length of 1 + 2b + 2d.
- If `a == 0`, `a` is 0, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is `c - 1`, `d` remains unchanged, `s1` is `b`, `s2` is `b + 2`, and `out` is `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.
Otherwise, if `s1 + 1 != s2`:
- If `d > 0`, `d` is decremented by 1, `s2` is updated to `c - (d - 1)`, and `out` is a list constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]`.
- If `d` is 0, `b` is decremented by 1, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, and `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`.
In all cases, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`.***
