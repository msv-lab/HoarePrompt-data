The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are non-negative integers. The function returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Specifically, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, if `y` is 0, the function returns the original value of `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It returns the original value of `x` if `y` is 0.**
