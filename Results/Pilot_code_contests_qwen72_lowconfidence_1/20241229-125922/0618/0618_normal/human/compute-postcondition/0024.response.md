The code snippet `print('NO')` does not alter any variables in the current state. It only outputs the string 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the initial state also remain valid.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d â‰¤ 10^5, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`. `s1` is not equal to `s2`. `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`. `s1` is not equal to `s2 + 1`.**
