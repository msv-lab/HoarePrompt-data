The code snippet swaps the values of `x` and `y` such that `x` now holds the value of the original `y`, and `y` now holds the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

Given the Initial State:
- `x` is the original value of `y`
- `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is now assigned the original value of `y`
- `y` is now assigned the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`

Since `x` was already the original value of `y`, and `y` was already the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`, the values of `x` and `y` remain the same after the swap.

Output State: **`x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`**
