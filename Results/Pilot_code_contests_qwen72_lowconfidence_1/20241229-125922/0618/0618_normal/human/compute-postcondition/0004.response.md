According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be non-zero. Since the current state specifies that `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`, this condition is already satisfied as long as the remainder is not zero.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`x` is the original value of `y`, `y` is the remainder of the original `x` divided by the original `y`**
