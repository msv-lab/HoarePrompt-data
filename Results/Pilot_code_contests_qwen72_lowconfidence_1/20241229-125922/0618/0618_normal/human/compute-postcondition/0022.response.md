Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + d \leq 10^5\). If `d > 0`, `d` is decremented by 1, `s2` is updated to `c - (d - 1)`, and `out` is a list constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]`. If `d` is 0, `b` is decremented by 1, `s1` is equal to `s2`, and `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`. In both cases, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`.***
