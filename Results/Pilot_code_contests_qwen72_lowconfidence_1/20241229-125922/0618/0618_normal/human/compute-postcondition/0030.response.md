The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the given context, it seems that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that their sum is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^5\). The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
