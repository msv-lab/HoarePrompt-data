The value of `d` is decremented by 1. Since `d` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `d` is now `d - 1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The conditions `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - d`, and `s1` is not equal to `s2` still hold. Additionally, `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1` is currently equal to `s2 + 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + (d - 1) â‰¤ 10^5, `d` is now `d - 1`, `s1` is equal to `b - a`, `s2` is equal to `c - (d - 1)`, `s1` is not equal to `s2`, `s1 + 1` is not equal to `s2`, and `s1` is equal to `s2 + 1`.**
