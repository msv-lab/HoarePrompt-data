Initial State: `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `s1` is equal to `b - a`, and `s2` is equal to `c - d`.

Code Snippet:
```python
if s1 == s2:
    out = [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d
elif s1 + 1 == s2:
    if a > 0:
        s1 = b - a + 1
        out = [0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d
    elif a == 0:
        a = 0
        b = b
        c = c - 1
        d = d
        s1 = b
        s2 = b + 2
        out = [2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d
else:
    if d > 0:
        d = d - 1
        s2 = c - (d - 1)
        out = [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]
    elif d == 0:
        b = b - 1
        s1 = b - a
        out = [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]

print(*out)
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
   - `s1` is equal to `b - a`.
   - `s2` is equal to `c - d`.

2. **Condition Check 1**: `if s1 == s2`
   - If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then:
     - `out` is set to `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
     - No changes to `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, or `s2`.

3. **Condition Check 2**: `elif s1 + 1 == s2`
   - If `s1 + 1` is equal to `s2`, then:
     - **Sub-condition 1**: `if a > 0`
       - `s1` is updated to `b - a + 1`.
       - `out` is set to `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
       - No changes to `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.
     - **Sub-condition 2**: `elif a == 0`
       - `a` remains 0.
       - `b` remains unchanged.
       - `c` is decremented by 1.
       - `d` remains unchanged.
       - `s1` is updated to `b`.
       - `s2` is updated to `b + 2`.
       - `out` is set to `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.

4. **Condition Check 3**: `else` (neither `s1 == s2` nor `s1 + 1 == s2`)
   - **Sub-condition 1**: `if d > 0`
     - `d` is decremented by 1.
     - `s2` is updated to `c - (d - 1)`.
     - `out` is set to `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]`.
   - **Sub-condition 2**: `elif d == 0`
     - `b` is decremented by 1.
     - `s1` is updated to `b - a`.
     - `out` is set to `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`.

5. **Final Action**:
   - `print(*out)` prints the elements of `out` separated by spaces.

**Output State**:
- If `s1 == s2`:
  - `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
  - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
  - `s1` is equal to `b - a`.
  - `s2` is equal to `c - d`.

- If `s1 + 1 == s2` and `a > 0`:
  - `out` is `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
  - `s1` is updated to `b - a + 1`.
  - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
  - `s2` remains `c - d`.

- If `s1 + 1 == s2` and `a == 0`:
  - `out` is `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.
  - `a` remains 0.
  - `b` remains unchanged.
  - `c` is decremented by 1.
  - `d` remains unchanged.
  - `s1` is updated to `b`.
  - `s2` is updated to `b + 2`.

- If `s1 + 1 != s2` and `d > 0`:
  - `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * (d - 1) + [3]`.
  - `d` is decremented by 1.
  - `s2` is updated to `c - (d - 1)`.
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
  - `s1` remains `b - a`.

- If `s1 + 1 != s2` and `d == 0`:
  - `out` is `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`.
  - `b` is decremented by 1.
  - `s1` is updated to `b - a`.
  - `a`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
  - `s2` remains `c - d`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5, and they have been updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `s1` is equal to `b - a`, and `s2` is equal to `c - d`. Depending on the conditions, `out` is constructed as specified in the code snippet. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `s1`, and `s2` are updated as described above.**
