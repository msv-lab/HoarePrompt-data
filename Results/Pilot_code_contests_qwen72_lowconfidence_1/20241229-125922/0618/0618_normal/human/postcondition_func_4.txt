The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting value of the range), `step` (an integer representing the difference between each consecutive value in the range), and `count` (a non-negative integer representing the number of values to generate in the range). It returns a range object that starts from `start`, ends before `start + step * count`, and increments by `step`. If `step` is zero and `count` is greater than zero, the function will return an empty range object because the end value will be equal to the start value, resulting in no progression. If `count` is zero, the function will also return an empty range object since no values are generated.
