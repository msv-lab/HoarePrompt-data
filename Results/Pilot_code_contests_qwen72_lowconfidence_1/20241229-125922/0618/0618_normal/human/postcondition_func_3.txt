The function `func_4` takes a callable object `f` and a tuple `dim` of non-negative integers. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `dim`. Each level of the list contains `dim[i]` elements, and the final elements are the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the returned structure is a list of lists (or a single value if `dim` is empty), with the dimensions specified by `dim`.
