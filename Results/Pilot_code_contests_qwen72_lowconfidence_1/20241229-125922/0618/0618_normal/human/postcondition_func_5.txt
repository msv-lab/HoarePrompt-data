The function `func_6` accepts a list `l`, a non-negative integer `start`, and an integer `end`. It returns a range object starting from `start` up to, but not including, `len(l) + end`. The list `l` remains unchanged. If `end` is negative, the upper bound of the range can be less than `start`, resulting in an empty range. If `end` is zero, the range will extend from `start` to the end of the list `l`. If `end` is positive, the range will extend beyond the length of the list `l`.
