Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_1` attempts to construct a beautiful sequence based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. However, the logic used to construct the sequence does not cover all possible cases correctly, leading to potential issues. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Case Handling for \(s1 + 1 = s2\)**:
   - When `a == 0`, the function incorrectly constructs the sequence as `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the sequence is beautiful. For example, if `a = 0`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`, and `d = 1`, the sequence should be `[2, 1, 2, 3, 2]`, but the function would construct `[2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Case Handling for \(s1 = s2 + 1\)**:
   - When `d == 0`, the function incorrectly constructs the sequence as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that the sequence is beautiful. For example, if `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`, and `d = 0`, the sequence should be `[1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0]`, but the function would construct `[1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the differences between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` do not allow for a beautiful sequence to be constructed. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, and `d = 2`, the function should return "NO" because it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence with these values. However, the function does not correctly identify this case and may produce an invalid sequence.

Given these issues, the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, it is incorrect.
