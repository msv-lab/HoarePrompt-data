Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` constructs the sequence based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, but it fails to handle some edge cases correctly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1 1 1 1
```
According to the problem description, a beautiful sequence using these numbers would be something like:
```
0 1 2 3
```
However, the program will output:
```
NO
```
This is incorrect because a valid beautiful sequence can be constructed with the given input.

### Analysis:
- The program checks if `s1 == s2`, `s1 + 1 == s2`, or `s1 == s2 + 1` to determine how to construct the sequence.
- For the input `1 1 1 1`, `s1 = b - a = 1 - 1 = 0` and `s2 = c - d = 1 - 1 = 0`. Since `s1 == s2`, the program should construct the sequence `[1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2]` but it does not handle this case correctly and outputs `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly edge cases where the differences between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are small and equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
