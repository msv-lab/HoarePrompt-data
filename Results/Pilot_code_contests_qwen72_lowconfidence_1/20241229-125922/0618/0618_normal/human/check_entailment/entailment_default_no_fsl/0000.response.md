Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for constructing the beautiful sequence has issues in several scenarios:

1. **Case when \( s1 + 1 = s2 \) and \( a == 0 \)**:
   - The code attempts to decrement `c` by 1 and constructs the sequence as `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`. However, this construction is incorrect because it does not ensure that the sequence starts with a 1 or 0, which is necessary to form a beautiful sequence. For example, if \( a = 0 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 3 \), and \( d = 1 \), the sequence would be `[2, 1, 2, 3, 2]`, which is not beautiful because the difference between the first and second elements is not 1.

2. **Case when \( s1 = s2 + 1 \) and \( d == 0 \)**:
   - The code attempts to decrement `b` by 1 and constructs the sequence as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`. This construction is also incorrect because it does not ensure that the sequence ends with a 2 or 3, which is necessary to form a beautiful sequence. For example, if \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 0 \), the sequence would be `[1, 0, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful because the difference between the last two elements is not 1.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to incorrect sequences being generated in some scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
