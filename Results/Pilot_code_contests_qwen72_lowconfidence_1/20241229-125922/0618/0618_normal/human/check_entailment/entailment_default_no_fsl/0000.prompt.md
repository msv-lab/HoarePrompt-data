You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It modifies the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the values returned by `func_3`. The function constructs a list `out` based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints "YES" followed by the elements of `out`. If certain conditions are not met, the function prints "NO" and exits early. The final state of the program is that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + d \leq 10^5\), and `out` is a list of integers constructed according to the rules described below:

1. If \(s1 = b - a\) is equal to \(s2 = c - d\):
   - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

2. If \(s1 + 1 = s2\):
   - If `a > 0`:
     - `a` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
   - If `a == 0`:
     - `c` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.

3. If \(s1 = s2 + 1\):
   - If `d > 0`:
     - `d` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`.
   - If `d == 0`:
     - `b` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints "NO" and exits early without constructing `out`.

In all cases where `out` is constructed, the function prints "YES" followed by the elements of `out`. The final state of the program is that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the values returned by `func_3` and modified according to the conditions described above.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both of the inputs are 0, returning the non-zero value or 0 if both are 0.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads four non-negative integers from the standard input, where the sum of these integers is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5. It returns a list containing these four integers. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., fewer or more than four integers, or integers that do not satisfy the sum condition), the behavior is undefined.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(f, *dim):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes a callable object `f` and a tuple `dim` of non-negative integers. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `dim`. Each level of the list contains `dim[i]` elements, and the final elements are the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the returned structure is a list of lists (or a single value if `dim` is empty), with the dimensions specified by `dim`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting value of the range), `step` (an integer representing the difference between each consecutive value in the range), and `count` (a non-negative integer representing the number of values to generate in the range). It returns a range object that starts from `start`, ends before `start + step * count`, and increments by `step`. If `step` is zero and `count` is greater than zero, the function will return an empty range object because the end value will be equal to the start value, resulting in no progression. If `count` is zero, the function will also return an empty range object since no values are generated.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(l, start=0, end=0):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a list `l`, a non-negative integer `start`, and an integer `end`. It returns a range object starting from `start` up to, but not including, `len(l) + end`. The list `l` remains unchanged. If `end` is negative, the upper bound of the range can be less than `start`, resulting in an empty range. If `end` is zero, the range will extend from `start` to the end of the list `l`. If `end` is positive, the range will extend beyond the length of the list `l`.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that for any given `n`, the function computes the smallest integer `m` such that \(2^m \geq n\). The function correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1` where the result is `1` (since \(2^0 = 1\)). The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, as it assumes `n` is a positive integer. After the function executes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned value, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, where `x` is an integer and `r` is a positive integer. It returns the integer division result of `(x + r - 1)` divided by `r`. This effectively rounds up the division of `x` by `r` to the nearest whole number. For example, if `x = 5` and `r = 3`, the function returns `2` because `(5 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2`. The function handles all valid integer inputs for `x` and positive integer inputs for `r`. If `r` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined and may lead to errors or incorrect results.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
