Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program aims to construct a beautiful sequence using the given counts of the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. However, there are several issues in the program that prevent it from meeting the problem description correctly:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence. For example, in the case where the counts of the numbers make it impossible to form a sequence (like the second and third examples in the problem description), the program does not consistently output "NO" in all such cases.

2. **Incorrect Construction of the Sequence:**
   - The logic used to construct the sequence in `func_1` is flawed. The program attempts to construct the sequence based on the differences `s1` and `s2`, but it does not always produce a valid beautiful sequence. For instance, the sequence construction logic does not account for all possible edge cases and may produce invalid sequences or sequences that do not meet the criteria of being beautiful.

3. **Unnecessary Functions:**
   - The program includes several functions (`func_2`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`) that are not used in the main logic of constructing the beautiful sequence. These functions do not contribute to solving the problem and can be considered extraneous.

4. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The program does not always print "NO" when it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence. Instead, it sometimes prints "YES" followed by an invalid sequence, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
1 2 3 4
```

According to the problem description, it should be impossible to form a beautiful sequence with these counts, and the output should be:
```
NO
```

However, the program does not correctly handle this case and may produce an invalid sequence or an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:

The program does not consistently meet the requirements of the problem description. It fails to handle edge cases correctly and does not always produce the correct output format. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
