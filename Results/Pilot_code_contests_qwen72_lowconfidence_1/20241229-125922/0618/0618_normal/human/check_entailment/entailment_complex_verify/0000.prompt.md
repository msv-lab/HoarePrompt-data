You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. One specific case where the program fails is when `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are such that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence, but the program incorrectly prints a sequence or fails to identify the impossibility correctly.

For example, consider the input `1 0 0 1`:

- The program will set `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, and `d = 1`.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` will both be `-1` (`s1 = b - a = 0 - 1 = -1` and `s2 = c - d = 0 - 1 = -1`).
- Since `s1 == s2`, the program will try to construct the sequence `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

However, this results in an invalid sequence because:
- `[1, 0] * 1` gives `[1, 0]`.
- `[1, 2] * (b - a)` gives an empty list since `b - a` is `-1`.
- `[3, 2] * 1` gives `[3, 2]`.

Combining these, the output sequence would be `[1, 0, 3, 2]`, which is not a valid beautiful sequence because the difference between `0` and `3` is not `1`.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with the given input, and it outputs an incorrect sequence. This makes the program incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It modifies the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` based on the values returned by `func_3`. The function constructs a list `out` based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints "YES" followed by the elements of `out`. If certain conditions are not met, the function prints "NO" and exits early. The final state of the program is that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 < a + b + c + d \leq 10^5\), and `out` is a list of integers constructed according to the rules described below:

1. If \(s1 = b - a\) is equal to \(s2 = c - d\):
   - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

2. If \(s1 + 1 = s2\):
   - If `a > 0`:
     - `a` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[0] + [1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.
   - If `a == 0`:
     - `c` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[2] + [1, 2] * b + [3, 2] * d`.

3. If \(s1 = s2 + 1\):
   - If `d > 0`:
     - `d` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d + [3]`.
   - If `d == 0`:
     - `b` is decremented by 1.
     - `out` is constructed as `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [1]`.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints "NO" and exits early without constructing `out`.

In all cases where `out` is constructed, the function prints "YES" followed by the elements of `out`. The final state of the program is that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the values returned by `func_3` and modified according to the conditions described above.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the case where either or both of the inputs are 0, returning the non-zero value or 0 if both are 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function. The function reads four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d from the standard input, where 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of four non-negative integers [a, b, c, d] read from the standard input, where 0 < a + b + c + d ≤ 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads four non-negative integers from the standard input, where the sum of these integers is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^5. It returns a list containing these four integers. If the input does not conform to the expected format (e.g., fewer or more than four integers, or integers that do not satisfy the sum condition), the behavior is undefined.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable object, dim is a tuple of non-negative integers.
def func_4(f):
    return [func_4(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
    #The program returns a list containing `dim[0]` elements, each element being the result of calling `func_4(f, *dim[1:])`, if `dim` is not empty; otherwise, it returns the result of calling `f()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a callable object `f` and a tuple `dim` of non-negative integers. It recursively constructs a nested list structure where the depth of the nesting corresponds to the length of `dim`. Each level of the list contains `dim[i]` elements, and the final elements are the result of calling `f()`. If `dim` is empty, the function directly returns the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the returned structure is a list of lists (or a single value if `dim` is empty), with the dimensions specified by `dim`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting value of the range, step is an integer representing the difference between each consecutive value in the range, and count is a non-negative integer representing the number of values to generate in the range.
def func_5(start, step, count):
    return range(start, start + step * count, step)
    #The program returns a range object that starts from `start`, ends before `start + step * count`, and increments by `step`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts three parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting value of the range), `step` (an integer representing the difference between each consecutive value in the range), and `count` (a non-negative integer representing the number of values to generate in the range). It returns a range object that starts from `start`, ends before `start + step * count`, and increments by `step`. If `step` is zero and `count` is greater than zero, the function will return an empty range object because the end value will be equal to the start value, resulting in no progression. If `count` is zero, the function will also return an empty range object since no values are generated.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list, start is a non-negative integer, and end is an integer such that 0 <= start <= len(l) and end >= 0.
def func_6(l, start, end):
    return range(start, len(l) + end)
    #The program returns a range object from `start` to `len(l) + end`. Here, `start` is a non-negative integer, `len(l)` is the length of the list `l`, and `end` is an integer such that the end point of the range is `len(l) + end`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list `l`, a non-negative integer `start`, and an integer `end`. It returns a range object starting from `start` up to, but not including, `len(l) + end`. The list `l` remains unchanged. If `end` is negative, the upper bound of the range can be less than `start`, resulting in an empty range. If `end` is zero, the range will extend from `start` to the end of the list `l`. If `end` is positive, the range will extend beyond the length of the list `l`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_7(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1).bit_length()
    #The program returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that for any given `n`, the function computes the smallest integer `m` such that \(2^m \geq n\). The function correctly handles all positive integers, including edge cases like `n = 1` where the result is `1` (since \(2^0 = 1\)). The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, as it assumes `n` is a positive integer. After the function executes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned value, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and r are integers such that r > 0.
def func_8(x, r):
    return (x + r - 1) // r
    #The program returns the integer division result of (x + r - 1) divided by r, where x is an integer and r is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, where `x` is an integer and `r` is a positive integer. It returns the integer division result of `(x + r - 1)` divided by `r`. This effectively rounds up the division of `x` by `r` to the nearest whole number. For example, if `x = 5` and `r = 3`, the function returns `2` because `(5 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2`. The function handles all valid integer inputs for `x` and positive integer inputs for `r`. If `r` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined and may lead to errors or incorrect results.
