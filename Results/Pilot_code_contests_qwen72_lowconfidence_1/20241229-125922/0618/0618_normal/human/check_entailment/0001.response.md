Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the counts of the numbers are such that a beautiful sequence cannot be formed. 

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`:

- The program will attempt to form a sequence with 1 zero, 1 one, and 1 two, but no threes.
- According to the logic in the program, it will check the differences `s1 = b - a` and `s2 = c - d`, which are both 0.
- The program will then construct the sequence `[1, 0, 1, 2]`, but this sequence is invalid because it contains an extra `1` and does not use all the given numbers correctly.

Another example is the input `0 1 1 1`:

- The program will attempt to form a sequence with 1 one, 1 two, and 1 three, but no zeros.
- The logic in the program will again fail to handle this case correctly, leading to an invalid sequence.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not always produce a valid beautiful sequence or correctly identify when it is impossible to do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
