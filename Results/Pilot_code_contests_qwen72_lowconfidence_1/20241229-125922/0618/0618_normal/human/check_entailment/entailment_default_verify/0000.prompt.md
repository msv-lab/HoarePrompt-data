You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: An integer sequence is called beautiful if the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. More formally, a sequence s_1, s_2, …, s_{n} is beautiful if |s_i - s_{i+1}| = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1.

Trans has a numbers 0, b numbers 1, c numbers 2 and d numbers 3. He wants to construct a beautiful sequence using all of these a + b + c + d numbers.

However, it turns out to be a non-trivial task, and Trans was not able to do it. Could you please help Trans?

Input

The only input line contains four non-negative integers a, b, c and d (0 < a+b+c+d ≤ 10^5).

Output

If it is impossible to construct a beautiful sequence satisfying the above constraints, print "NO" (without quotes) in one line.

Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. Then in the second line print a + b + c + d integers, separated by spaces — a beautiful sequence. There should be a numbers equal to 0, b numbers equal to 1, c numbers equal to 2 and d numbers equal to 3.

If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.

Examples

Input


2 2 2 1


Output


YES
0 1 0 1 2 3 2


Input


1 2 3 4


Output


NO


Input


2 2 2 3


Output


NO

Note

In the first test, it is easy to see, that the sequence is beautiful because the difference between any two consecutive numbers is equal to 1. Also, there are exactly two numbers, equal to 0, 1, 2 and exactly one number, equal to 3.

It can be proved, that it is impossible to construct beautiful sequences in the second and third tests.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. One specific case where the program fails is when `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are such that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence, but the program incorrectly prints a sequence or fails to identify the impossibility correctly.

For example, consider the input `1 0 0 1`:

- The program will set `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, and `d = 1`.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` will both be `-1` (`s1 = b - a = 0 - 1 = -1` and `s2 = c - d = 0 - 1 = -1`).
- Since `s1 == s2`, the program will try to construct the sequence `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

However, this results in an invalid sequence because:
- `[1, 0] * 1` gives `[1, 0]`.
- `[1, 2] * (b - a)` gives an empty list since `b - a` is `-1`.
- `[3, 2] * 1` gives `[3, 2]`.

Combining these, the output sequence would be `[1, 0, 3, 2]`, which is not a valid beautiful sequence because the difference between `0` and `3` is not `1`.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with the given input, and it outputs an incorrect sequence. This makes the program incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_8` accepts two parameters `x` and `r`, where `x` is an integer and `r` is a positive integer. It returns the integer division result of `(x + r - 1)` divided by `r`. This effectively rounds up the division of `x` by `r` to the nearest whole number. For example, if `x = 5` and `r = 3`, the function returns `2` because `(5 + 3 - 1) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2`. The function handles all valid integer inputs for `x` and positive integer inputs for `r`. If `r` is not a positive integer, the behavior is undefined and may lead to errors or incorrect results.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
