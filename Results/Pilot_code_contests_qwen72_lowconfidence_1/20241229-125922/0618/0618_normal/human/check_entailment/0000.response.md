Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. One specific case where the program fails is when `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are such that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence, but the program incorrectly prints a sequence or fails to identify the impossibility correctly.

For example, consider the input `1 0 0 1`:

- The program will set `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`, and `d = 1`.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` will both be `-1` (`s1 = b - a = 0 - 1 = -1` and `s2 = c - d = 0 - 1 = -1`).
- Since `s1 == s2`, the program will try to construct the sequence `[1, 0] * a + [1, 2] * (b - a) + [3, 2] * d`.

However, this results in an invalid sequence because:
- `[1, 0] * 1` gives `[1, 0]`.
- `[1, 2] * (b - a)` gives an empty list since `b - a` is `-1`.
- `[3, 2] * 1` gives `[3, 2]`.

Combining these, the output sequence would be `[1, 0, 3, 2]`, which is not a valid beautiful sequence because the difference between `0` and `3` is not `1`.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly identify that it is impossible to form a beautiful sequence with the given input, and it outputs an incorrect sequence. This makes the program incorrect.
