Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program always divides `n` by its smallest prime factor, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the sequence `c1, c2, ..., ck`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input `n = 12`.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The optimal sequence should be:
  - `c1 = 12`
  - `c2 = 6` (by arranging 12 pebbles into 2 rows of 6)
  - `c3 = 3` (by arranging 6 pebbles into 2 rows of 3)
  - `c4 = 1` (by arranging 3 pebbles into 3 rows of 1)
- The sum is `12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22`.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The program will divide 12 by its smallest prime factor, which is 2:
  - `c1 = 12`
  - `c2 = 6` (by dividing 12 by 2)
  - `c3 = 3` (by dividing 6 by 2)
  - `c4 = 1` (by dividing 3 by 3)
- The sum is `12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22`, but this is not the only possible sequence.

However, the program does not consider other possible arrangements that could lead to a higher sum. For example, another valid sequence for `n = 12` could be:
- `c1 = 12`
- `c2 = 4` (by arranging 12 pebbles into 3 rows of 4)
- `c3 = 2` (by arranging 4 pebbles into 2 rows of 2)
- `c4 = 1` (by arranging 2 pebbles into 2 rows of 1)
- The sum is `12 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 19`.

Since the program does not explore all possible arrangements to find the maximum possible result, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
