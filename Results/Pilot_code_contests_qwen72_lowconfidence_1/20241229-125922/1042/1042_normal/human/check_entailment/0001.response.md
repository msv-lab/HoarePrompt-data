Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce the correct result according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible factors of `n` and always selects the smallest factor greater than 1. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible result.

For example, consider the input `n = 12`. The correct sequence of moves to maximize the result would be:

- Start with 12 pebbles.
- Arrange them in 4 rows of 3 pebbles each. Take one row, so `c2 = 3`.
- Arrange 3 pebbles in 3 rows of 1 pebble each. Take one row, so `c3 = 1`.

The total result is `12 + 3 + 1 = 16`.

However, the program will do the following:

- Start with 12 pebbles.
- Arrange them in 6 rows of 2 pebbles each. Take one row, so `c2 = 2`.
- Arrange 2 pebbles in 2 rows of 1 pebble each. Take one row, so `c3 = 1`.

The total result is `12 + 2 + 1 = 15`, which is not the maximum possible result.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
