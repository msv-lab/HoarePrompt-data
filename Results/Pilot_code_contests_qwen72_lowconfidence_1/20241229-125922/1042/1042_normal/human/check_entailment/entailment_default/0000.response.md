Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the program selects the number of rows (`a`) and the number of pebbles per row (`b`). The program always chooses the smallest prime factor of `n` to divide `n`, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the sequence `c1, c2, ..., ck`.

According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of the sequence `c1, c2, ..., ck` by strategically choosing the number of rows and pebbles per row at each step. The program, however, always divides `n` by its smallest prime factor, which may not yield the maximum possible result.

For example, consider the input `n = 10`:
- The program will divide 10 by 2 (the smallest prime factor), resulting in `b = 5`.
- Then it will divide 5 by 5 (the smallest prime factor), resulting in `b = 1`.
- The final result is `10 + 5 + 1 = 16`.

While this result is correct for `n = 10`, it does not guarantee that the program will always produce the maximum possible result for every input. For instance, if `n = 12`:
- The program will divide 12 by 2 (the smallest prime factor), resulting in `b = 6`.
- Then it will divide 6 by 2 (the smallest prime factor), resulting in `b = 3`.
- Then it will divide 3 by 3 (the smallest prime factor), resulting in `b = 1`.
- The final result is `12 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 22`.

However, a better strategy would be:
- Divide 12 by 3, resulting in `b = 4`.
- Then divide 4 by 2, resulting in `b = 2`.
- Then divide 2 by 2, resulting in `b = 1`.
- The final result is `12 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 19`.

Thus, the program does not always produce the maximum possible result, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
