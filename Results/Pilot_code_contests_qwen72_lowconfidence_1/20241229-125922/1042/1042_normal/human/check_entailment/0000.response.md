Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the required cases effectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the initial number of pebbles `n` from the input using `raw_input()` and converts it to an integer.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `count` with the value of `n`, which represents the total sum of the pebbles taken back during the game.
3. **Main Loop**: The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, which is the condition specified in the problem description.
4. **Finding Divisors**: Inside the loop, it finds the smallest divisor `i` of `n` greater than 1. This ensures that `n` can be divided into `i` rows, each containing `n // i` pebbles.
5. **Update Count and n**: It updates `count` by adding the number of pebbles in one row (`b`), and sets `n` to this value for the next iteration.
6. **Output**: After the loop, it prints the final value of `count`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description. It ensures that the game continues until the Beaver ends up with exactly one pebble, and the sum of the pebbles taken back is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.
