The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an odd number greater than 1 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 5, `b` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`.
Output State: **`n` is an odd number greater than 1 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 5, `b` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`**
