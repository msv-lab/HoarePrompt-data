To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop step by step and generalize the results.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `count` is equal to `n`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
while n != 1:
    i = 2
    while divmod(n, i)[1] != 0:
        i += 1
    b = divmod(n, i)[0]
    count += b
    n = b
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - The inner loop finds the smallest divisor `i` of `n` such that `n % i == 0`.
   - `b` is set to `n // i`.
   - `count` is updated to `count + b`.
   - `n` is updated to `b`.

   After the first iteration:
   - `n` is now `n // i`, where `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `n`.
   - `count` is `n + (n // i)`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - The process repeats with the new value of `n`.
   - `i` is reset to 2 and the smallest divisor of the new `n` is found.
   - `b` is set to the new `n // i`.
   - `count` is updated to `count + b`.
   - `n` is updated to `b`.

   After the second iteration:
   - `n` is now `(n // i1) // i2`, where `i1` and `i2` are the smallest prime factors of the respective values of `n`.
   - `count` is `n + (n // i1) + ((n // i1) // i2)`.

3. **Generalization:**
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 1.
   - Each iteration reduces `n` by dividing it by its smallest prime factor.
   - `count` accumulates the sum of the quotients at each step.

### Final Output State:
- When the loop terminates, `n` will be 1.
- `count` will be the sum of the original `n` and the quotients obtained at each step of the division by the smallest prime factor.

Given the nature of the loop, the final state can be described as follows:

- `n` is 1.
- `count` is the sum of the original value of `n` and the quotients obtained at each step of the division by the smallest prime factor.

### Output State:
**`n` is 1, `count` is the sum of the original value of `n` and the quotients obtained at each step of the division by the smallest prime factor of `n`.**
