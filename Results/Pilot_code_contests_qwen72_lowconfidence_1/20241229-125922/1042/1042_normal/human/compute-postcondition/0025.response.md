The value of `n` is updated to be equal to `b`. Since `b` is defined as `n // i` in the initial state, `n` now holds the value of `n // i`. The other variables (`i`, `count`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n // i`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`.

Output State: **`n` is `n // i`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`**
