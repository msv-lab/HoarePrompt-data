The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `count`) remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` is an odd number greater than 1 and not divisible by 3, `b` is `n // 2`, and `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)` are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an odd number greater than 1 and not divisible by 3, `i` is 4, `b` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`**
