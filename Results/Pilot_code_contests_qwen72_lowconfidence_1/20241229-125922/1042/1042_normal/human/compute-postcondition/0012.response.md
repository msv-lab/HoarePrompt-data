The value of `count` is incremented by `b`. Since `b` is equal to `n // i`, where `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`, the new value of `count` is the original value of `n` plus `n // i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`, `b` is equal to `n // i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`, `b` is equal to `n // i`.**
