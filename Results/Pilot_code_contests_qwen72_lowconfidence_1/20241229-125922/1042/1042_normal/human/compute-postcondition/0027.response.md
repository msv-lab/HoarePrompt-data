The value of `i` is set to 2. This overrides the initial value of `i` which was the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`. The other variables (`n`, `b`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`**
