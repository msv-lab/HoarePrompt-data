To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `divmod(n, i)[1] != 0`. This condition checks if the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is not zero. For the loop to execute, `i` should not be a divisor of `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `b` is `n // i`
- `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`

Let's break down the condition:
- `divmod(n, i)[1]` returns the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
- For `divmod(n, i)[1] != 0` to be true, `i` must not divide `n` evenly.

Since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `n` is not an even number (i.e., `n` should be odd). If `n` is odd, then `2` (which is `i`) will not divide `n` evenly, and the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is an odd number greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an odd number greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`**
