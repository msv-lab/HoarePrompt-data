To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop statement:

### Initial State:
- `n` is now `n // i` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `n // i`.

### `while` Loop Condition:
```python
while divmod(n, i)[1] != 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop condition `divmod(n, i)[1] != 0` checks if the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is not zero. For the loop to execute, the remainder must be non-zero.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is `n // i` and must be greater than 1.
   - `b` is `n // i`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `n % i != 0`.
   - Given `i` is 2, `n % 2` must not be 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For `n % 2 != 0`, `n` must be an odd number.
   - Since `n` is `n // i` and must be greater than 1, `n` must be an odd number greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The current state does not specify whether `n` is odd or even. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be an odd number greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is now `n // i` and `n` must be an odd number greater than 1, `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is 2, `b` is equal to `n // i`**
