The value of `b` is `n // i`. The line `count += b` adds the value of `b` to `count`. Since `count` was originally `n + n // i`, adding `b` (which is `n // i`) to `count` results in `count` being updated to `n + 2 * (n // i)`.

The other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged, as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n // i`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`.
Output State: **`n` is `n // i`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // i)`**
