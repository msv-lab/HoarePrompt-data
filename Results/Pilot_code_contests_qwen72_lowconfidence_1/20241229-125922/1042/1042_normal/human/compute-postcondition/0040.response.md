The function `func` does not accept any parameters based on the given function signature. However, it's mentioned that there is an output based on a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since `n` is not part of the function parameters, it might be defined within the function or passed through another means (like a global variable or a default argument), but based strictly on the provided information, we cannot assume its presence as a direct input parameter.

Given the lack of parameters in the function signature, and without further details on what the function returns based on `n`, I cannot fully describe the functionality of the function. However, if we were to infer from the context, the functionality might involve processing or returning a value based on the integer `n`.

Since the exact output is not specified, I can only provide a general statement:

Functionality: **The function processes an internal or externally provided integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but the specific output based on `n` is not defined in the provided information.**
