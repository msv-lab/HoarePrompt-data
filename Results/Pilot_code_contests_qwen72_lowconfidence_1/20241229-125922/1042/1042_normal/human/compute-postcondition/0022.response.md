To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and the final values of the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `n` is now `n // i` and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `n // i`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while divmod(n, i)[1] != 0:
    i += 1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues to increment `i` until `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `divmod(n, i)[1] == 0`).
- When the loop terminates, `i` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop terminates, `i` will be the smallest divisor of `n` greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged from its value after the initial state (i.e., `n // i` where `i` is the initial value of `i`).
- `count` remains the same as it was in the initial state (i.e., the original value of `n` + `n // i`).
- `b` remains the same as it was in the initial state (i.e., `n // i`).

### Output State:
**`n` is `n // i` (where `i` is the initial value of `i`), `count` is the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2 such that `n % i == 0`, `b` is `n // i`.**
