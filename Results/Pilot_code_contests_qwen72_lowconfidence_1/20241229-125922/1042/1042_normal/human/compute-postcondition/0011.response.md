The value of `b` is assigned the quotient from the division of `n` by `i`, where `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`. The remainder is discarded since only the first element of the tuple returned by `divmod(n, i)` is used. The values of `n`, `count`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`, `b` is equal to `n // i`**
