The value of `count` is assigned the current value of `n`. Since `n` is updated to the integer value input by the user, `count` now holds this new value of `n`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`**
