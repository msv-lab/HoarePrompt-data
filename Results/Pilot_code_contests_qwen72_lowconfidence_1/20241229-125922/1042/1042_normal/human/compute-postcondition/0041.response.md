Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) from the user, and then repeatedly divides `n` by its smallest prime factor until `n` becomes 1. During each division, it adds the quotient to a running total (`count`), which starts with the initial value of `n`. After the loop completes, the function prints the final value of `count`. The final state of the program is that `n` is 1, and `count` is the sum of the original value of `n` and all the quotients obtained during the division process. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input `n` is 1, the function will immediately print `1` because the loop condition `n != 1` will not be satisfied, and the function will exit without performing any divisions.
- The function assumes that the input is always a valid integer within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). If the input is out of this range or not an integer, the behavior is undefined and could lead to errors or incorrect results.
