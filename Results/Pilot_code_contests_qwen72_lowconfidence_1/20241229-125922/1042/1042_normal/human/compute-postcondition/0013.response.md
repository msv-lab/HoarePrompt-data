The value of `n` is updated to be equal to `b`. Since `b` is defined as `n // i`, where `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`, the new value of `n` becomes `n // i`.

- `n` was originally an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`.
- `i` is the smallest prime factor of `n`.
- `b` was initially set to `n // i`.

After executing the code snippet `n = b`, the new value of `n` is `b`, which is `n // i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now `b` (which is `n // i`), `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `n`, `b` is equal to `n // i`.
Output State: **`n` is now `n // i`, `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is the smallest prime factor of the original `n`, `b` is equal to `n // i`.**
