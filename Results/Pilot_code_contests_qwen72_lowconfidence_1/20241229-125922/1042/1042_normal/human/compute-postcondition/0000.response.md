The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value obtained from `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and then `int()` converts this string to an integer, the new value of `n` depends on the user's input. However, the precondition specifies that `n` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Assuming the user inputs a valid integer within this range, the new value of `n` will also satisfy this condition.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is updated to the integer value input by the user.**
