The value of `b` is updated to the quotient of `divmod(n, i)`. Given that `i` is the smallest divisor of `n` greater than 1, `divmod(n, i)` returns a tuple where the first element is the quotient of the division `n // i`. Therefore, `b` is now equal to `n // i`.

The other variables remain unchanged. `n` remains unchanged, `i` remains the smallest divisor of `n` greater than 1, and `count` remains `n + 2 * (n // 2)`.

Output State: **`i` is the smallest divisor of `n` greater than 1, `n` remains unchanged, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`**
