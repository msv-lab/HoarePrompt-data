The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 4, so the new value of `i` is 5. The other variables (`n`, `count`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is now `n // i` and `n` must be an odd number greater than 1 and not divisible by 3, `count` is equal to the original value of `n` + `n // i`, `i` is 5, `b` is equal to `n // i`**
