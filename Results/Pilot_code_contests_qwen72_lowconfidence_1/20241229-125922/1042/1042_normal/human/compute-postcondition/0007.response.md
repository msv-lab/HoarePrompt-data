The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 3 to 4. The values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an odd integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is an odd integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `count` is equal to `n`, `i` is 4**
