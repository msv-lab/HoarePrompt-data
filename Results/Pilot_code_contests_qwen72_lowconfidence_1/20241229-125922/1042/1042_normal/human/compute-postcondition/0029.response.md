The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. The values of `n`, `b`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an odd number greater than 1, `i` is 3, `b` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`.
Output State: **`n` is an odd number greater than 1, `i` is 3, `b` is `n // 2`, `count` is `n + 2 * (n // 2)`**
