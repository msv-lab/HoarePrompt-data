The code snippet `n = b` updates the value of `n` to be equal to the value of `b`, which is `n // i`.

- `i` remains the smallest divisor of the original `n` greater than 1.
- `n` was originally a certain value, but now it is updated to `n // i`.
- `b` remains `n // i`, but since `n` is now `b`, this means `b` is effectively `b // i`.
- `count` was `n + 2 * (n // 2) + (n // i)`, but since `n` is now `b`, `count` remains unchanged because it was calculated based on the original value of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is the smallest divisor of the original `n` greater than 1, `n` is `n // i`, `b` is `n // i`, `count` is `original_n + 2 * (original_n // 2) + (original_n // i)`**.
