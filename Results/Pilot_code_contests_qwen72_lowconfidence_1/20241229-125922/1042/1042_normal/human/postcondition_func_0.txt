The function `func` reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) from the user, and then repeatedly divides `n` by its smallest prime factor until `n` becomes 1. During each division, it adds the quotient to a running total (`count`), which starts with the initial value of `n`. After the loop completes, the function prints the final value of `count`. The final state of the program is that `n` is 1, and `count` is the sum of the original value of `n` and all the quotients obtained during the division process.
