Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Comparison**:
   - The program attempts to check if `s` can form a string lexicographically larger than `t` by comparing the counts of characters (`scount` and `tcount`). However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the lexicographical order of permutations of `s`.
   - For example, consider the input `s = "abc"` and `t = "bca"`. The program might incorrectly conclude that `s` cannot form a string lexicographically larger than `t` because it only checks the counts of characters, not the actual permutations.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Minimum Lexicographical String**:
   - The program tries to find the minimum lexicographical string that is greater than `t` by manipulating the character counts. However, this logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.
   - For instance, if `s = "abcd"` and `t = "abdc"`, the program might not correctly identify that "acbd" is the smallest lexicographical string greater than "abdc".

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the length of `s` is different from the length of `t`. For example, if `s` is longer than `t`, the program should still try to find the smallest lexicographical string greater than `t` by appending the remaining characters of `s`.

4. **Incorrect Use of `allgreater` Variable**:
   - The variable `allgreater` is used to check if `s` can form a string lexicographically larger than `t` by comparing character counts. However, this is not a valid way to determine lexicographical order. A correct approach would involve generating permutations of `s` and comparing them directly to `t`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Generate all permutations of the string `s`.
2. Filter out permutations that are lexicographically greater than `t`.
3. From the filtered permutations, select the lexicographically smallest one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def find_next_lexicographical_string(s, t):
    # Generate all permutations of s
    perms = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(s)]
    
    # Filter permutations that are lexicographically greater than t
    valid_perms = [perm for perm in perms if perm > t]
    
    # If no valid permutations, return -1
    if not valid_perms:
        return -1
    
    # Return the lexicographically smallest valid permutation
    return min(valid_perms)

# Example usage
s = input().strip()
t = input().strip()
print(find_next_lexicographical_string(s, t))
```

This corrected program ensures that it finds the smallest lexicographical string greater than `t` by generating all permutations of `s` and filtering them accordingly. This approach meets the requirements of the problem description.
