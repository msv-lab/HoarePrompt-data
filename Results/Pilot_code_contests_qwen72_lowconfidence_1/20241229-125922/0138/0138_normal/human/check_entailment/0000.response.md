Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the comparison and construction of the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`. Specifically, the issue arises in how it determines whether a permutation of `s` can be formed that is lexicographically greater than `t`.

### Case Analysis:
Consider the following input:
```
s = "abc"
t = "bca"
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
```

Actual Output:
The program will incorrectly output a string, such as "acb", which is lexicographically greater than "bca".

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Initial Comparison**: The program initially checks if `s` has enough characters to form a string that is lexicographically greater than `t`. This is done by comparing the counts of each character in `s` and `t`. However, this check is not sufficient to ensure that a valid permutation exists.

2. **Permutation Construction**: The program then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t` by iterating through each character of `t` and finding the next possible character in `s` that is greater than the current character in `t`. This approach fails to consider all possible permutations and may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where no valid permutation exists correctly. For example, in the case where `s` is "abc" and `t` is "bca", the program should return `-1`, but it does not.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly those where no valid permutation exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
