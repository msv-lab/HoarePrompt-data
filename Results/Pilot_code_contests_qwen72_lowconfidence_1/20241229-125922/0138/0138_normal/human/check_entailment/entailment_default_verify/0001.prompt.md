You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Everything got unclear to us in a far away constellation Tau Ceti. Specifically, the Taucetians choose names to their children in a very peculiar manner.

Two young parents abac and bbad think what name to give to their first-born child. They decided that the name will be the permutation of letters of string s. To keep up with the neighbours, they decided to call the baby so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than the neighbour's son's name t.

On the other hand, they suspect that a name tax will be introduced shortly. According to it, the Taucetians with lexicographically larger names will pay larger taxes. That's the reason abac and bbad want to call the newborn so that the name was lexicographically strictly larger than name t and lexicographically minimum at that.

The lexicographical order of strings is the order we are all used to, the "dictionary" order. Such comparison is used in all modern programming languages to compare strings. Formally, a string p of length n is lexicographically less than string q of length m, if one of the two statements is correct:

  * n < m, and p is the beginning (prefix) of string q (for example, "aba" is less than string "abaa"), 
  * p1 = q1, p2 = q2, ..., pk - 1 = qk - 1, pk < qk for some k (1 ≤ k ≤ min(n, m)), here characters in strings are numbered starting from 1. 



Write a program that, given string s and the heighbours' child's name t determines the string that is the result of permutation of letters in s. The string should be lexicographically strictly more than t and also, lexicographically minimum.

Input

The first line contains a non-empty string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000), where |s| is its length. The second line contains a non-empty string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 5000), where |t| is its length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters.

Output

Print the sought name or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples

Input

aad
aac


Output

aad


Input

abad
bob


Output

daab


Input

abc
defg

-1


Input

czaaab
abcdef

Note

In the first sample the given string s is the sought one, consequently, we do not need to change the letter order there.
Program:

    t = list(raw_input())
    scount = [0] * 26

    for char in s:
        scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the case when `s` can form a lexicographically greater string than `t`, but the program incorrectly concludes that no such string exists in some scenarios. Specifically, the issue lies in the logic where the program checks if `s` can form a string that is lexicographically greater than `t` by comparing character counts. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the lexicographical order of permutations of `s`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "abdc"
```

The correct output should be `"acbd"`, which is the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is greater than `t`. However, the program will incorrectly return `-1`.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Character Count Comparison**: The program checks if `s` has a higher count of each character compared to `t` using the `allgreater` variable. This is a flawed approach because it does not consider the lexicographical order of permutations of `s`.

2. **Permutation Logic**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is greater than `t` by iterating through `t` and finding the next possible character in `s` that is greater than the current character in `t`. However, this logic is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly when the characters in `s` and `t` are not in the same order.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Generate all permutations of `s`.
2. Filter out permutations that are lexicographically greater than `t`.
3. Return the lexicographically smallest permutation from the filtered results.

However, generating all permutations is not efficient for large strings. A more efficient approach involves using a greedy algorithm to construct the desired permutation directly by comparing characters and ensuring the lexicographical order is maintained.

Given the flaws in the provided program, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` processes two input strings `s` and `t`, both of which are non-empty and consist of lowercase Latin letters with lengths between 1 and 5000. The function returns one of the following:

1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
