### Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest permutation of string `s` that is strictly greater than string `t`. If no such permutation exists, the program should return `-1`.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect. The main reasons given are:
1. The program has a logical error in how it handles the comparison and construction of the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `t`.
2. The program fails to handle edge cases where no valid permutation exists, such as when `s = "abc"` and `t = "bca"`.

#### Annotated Code Review
Let's review the annotated code step-by-step to see if it aligns with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

1. **Initialization and Character Counting:**
   ```python
   s = list(raw_input())
   t = list(raw_input())
   scount = [0] * 26
   tcount = [0] * 26
   for char in s:
       scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
   for char in t:
       tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
   ```
   - The program correctly initializes and counts the occurrences of each character in `s` and `t`.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   ```python
   allgreater = True
   for i in range(26):
       if scount[i] < tcount[i]:
           allgreater = False
   ```
   - The program checks if `s` has enough characters to potentially form a string greater than `t`. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

3. **Handling the Case Where `s` Can Form a Larger String:**
   ```python
   if allgreater:
       if len(s) == len(t):
           return -1
       for char in t:
           scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
       for i in range(26):
           while scount[i] > 0:
               t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
               scount[i] -= 1
       return ''.join(map(str, t))
   ```
   - If `s` has enough characters and is longer than `t`, the program appends the remaining characters from `s` to `t` to form a larger string. This part seems correct.

4. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Permutation:**
   ```python
   works = -1
   scountcopy = list(scount)
   for i in range(len(s)):
       cando = False
       for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
           if scountcopy[j] > 0:
               cando = True
       if cando:
           works = i
       if scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] == 0:
           break
       scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
   if works == -1:
       return -1
   res = list()
   for i in range(works):
       res.append(t[i])
       scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1
   for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
       if scount[j] > 0:
           res.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
           scount[j] -= 1
           break
   for i in range(26):
       while scount[i] > 0:
           res.append(chr(i + ord('a')))
           scount[i] -= 1
   return ''.join(map(str, res))
   ```
   - The program attempts to find the position `works` where it can replace `t[works]` with a larger character from `s` and then append the remaining characters in lexicographical order. This approach is generally correct but may fail in edge cases.

#### Edge Case Analysis
Consider the edge case where `s = "abc"` and `t = "bca"`:
- The program will correctly identify that `s` has enough characters to form a larger string.
- However, the program will incorrectly output a string like "acb" instead of returning `-1`.

#### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly those where no valid permutation exists. The original assessment is accurate in identifying this issue.

### Final Assessment
Final: **False**
