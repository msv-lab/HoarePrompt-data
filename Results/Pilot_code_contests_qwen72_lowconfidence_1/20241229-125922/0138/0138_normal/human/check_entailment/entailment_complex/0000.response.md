Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues and why the program fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `allgreater` Condition:**
   - The program checks if the count of each character in `s` is greater than or equal to the count of the same character in `t` using the `allgreater` variable. However, this check is incorrect because it does not ensure that the permutation of `s` is lexicographically strictly larger than `t`. For example, if `s = "abc"` and `t = "abc"`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` even though a valid permutation like "bac" is lexicographically larger than "abc".

2. **Incorrect Permutation Logic:**
   - The program attempts to append characters to `t` to form a new string, but it does not correctly handle the lexicographical comparison and permutation. It simply appends characters in a way that does not guarantee the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest string that is strictly larger than `t`.

3. **Handling of `works` Variable:**
   - The `works` variable is intended to find the position where the permutation can start to be different from `t`. However, the logic to find this position is flawed. It does not correctly identify the point where the permutation can be made larger while ensuring the resulting string is still lexicographically minimal.

4. **Incorrect Return Values:**
   - The program returns `-1` in several places where it should not. For example, if `s` and `t` are of different lengths and `s` can be permuted to be larger than `t`, the program incorrectly returns `-1`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
- **Input:**
  ```
  s = "abc"
  t = "abc"
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  bac
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  -1
  ```

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if any permutation of `s` can be lexicographically larger than `t`.
2. If possible, find the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is strictly larger than `t`.
3. If no such permutation exists, return `-1`.

A correct implementation would involve generating permutations of `s` and comparing them to `t` to find the smallest valid permutation. Alternatively, a more efficient approach would involve a greedy algorithm to construct the desired permutation directly.

Since the provided program does not meet these requirements, it is **incorrect**.
