Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, there is an issue in the logic that checks if the permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`.

1. **Issue with Initial Check**: The initial check to determine if `s` can be greater than `t` by comparing character counts is flawed. The code checks if `s` has at least as many of each character as `t` (`allgreater`). However, this is not sufficient to ensure that a permutation of `s` can be lexicographically greater than `t`. For example, if `s = "aabc"` and `t = "abcd"`, the code incorrectly concludes that no permutation of `s` can be greater than `t` because `s` does not have enough 'd's, even though "baca" is a valid permutation that is greater than "abcd".

2. **Handling of Equal Length Strings**: The code has a special case for when the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal. It immediately returns `-1` if `allgreater` is true, which is incorrect. For example, if `s = "bca"` and `t = "abc"`, the correct answer should be "bac", but the code would return `-1`.

3. **Permutation Logic**: The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is greater than `t` is also flawed. The code attempts to build the result by appending characters from `t` and then adding the remaining characters from `s`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the characters in `s` need to be rearranged to form a valid permutation.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
