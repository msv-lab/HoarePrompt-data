Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the case when `s` can form a lexicographically greater string than `t`, but the program incorrectly concludes that no such string exists in some scenarios. Specifically, the issue lies in the logic where the program checks if `s` can form a string that is lexicographically greater than `t` by comparing character counts. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the lexicographical order of permutations of `s`.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
s = "abcd"
t = "abdc"
```

The correct output should be `"acbd"`, which is the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is greater than `t`. However, the program will incorrectly return `-1`.

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Character Count Comparison**: The program checks if `s` has a higher count of each character compared to `t` using the `allgreater` variable. This is a flawed approach because it does not consider the lexicographical order of permutations of `s`.

2. **Permutation Logic**: The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` that is greater than `t` by iterating through `t` and finding the next possible character in `s` that is greater than the current character in `t`. However, this logic is not robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly when the characters in `s` and `t` are not in the same order.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Generate all permutations of `s`.
2. Filter out permutations that are lexicographically greater than `t`.
3. Return the lexicographically smallest permutation from the filtered results.

However, generating all permutations is not efficient for large strings. A more efficient approach involves using a greedy algorithm to construct the desired permutation directly by comparing characters and ensuring the lexicographical order is maintained.

Given the flaws in the provided program, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
