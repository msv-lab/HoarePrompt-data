The code snippet sets `cando` to `False`. This changes the value of `cando` from its previous state (which could be `True` or `False`) to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 26, `cando` is `False`, `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1**
