`scountcopy` is assigned a copy of the list `scount`. This means `scountcopy` is now a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, and any changes made to `scountcopy` will not affect `scount`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`. If `t` is an empty list, `tcount` remains a list of 26 zeros. `allgreater` is `False` because there exists at least one character `c` in the alphabet for which the count of `c` in `s` is less than the count of `c` in `t`. `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`**.
