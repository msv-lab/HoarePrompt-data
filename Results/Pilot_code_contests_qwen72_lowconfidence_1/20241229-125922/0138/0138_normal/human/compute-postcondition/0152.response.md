The code snippet `scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1` decrements the value of `scount` at the index calculated by `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` by 1. Given that `i` is 2, this means the character `t[2]` is used to find the index in `scount`.

Given the initial state:
- `works` is greater than 2
- `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[1], t[2]]`
- `i` is 2
- `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1 from its original value

After executing the code snippet, the value of `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1 again, meaning it is now decremented by 2 from its original value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`works` is greater than 2, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[1], t[2]]`, `i` is 2, `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 2 from its original value**
