Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`, if `t` is an empty list, `tcount` remains a list of 26 zeros, `allgreater` is `True`. The current value of `scount[i]` is less than the current value of `tcount[i]`.***
