To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `scount[i] > 0`.

### Given State:
- `works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`.
- `t[works]` is a lowercase letter.
- `res` is the list initially containing the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character that is the next available character in the alphabet after `t[works]` with a positive count in `scount`.
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + k]` is decremented by 1 if a valid `k` was found, otherwise `scount` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `scount[i] > 0`.
- Since `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `scount[0] > 0`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `scount[0]` to ensure it is greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `res` is the list initially containing the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character that is the next available character in the alphabet after `t[works]` with a positive count in `scount`, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + k]` is decremented by 1 if a valid `k` was found, otherwise `scount` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, and `scount[0]` must be greater than 0**
