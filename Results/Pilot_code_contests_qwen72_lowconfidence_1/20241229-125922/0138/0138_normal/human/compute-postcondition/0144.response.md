According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `works`. For the loop to execute, `works` must be greater than 0. The variable `res` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution directly, but it is part of the initial state.

So, for the loop to execute, `works` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`works` is greater than 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
