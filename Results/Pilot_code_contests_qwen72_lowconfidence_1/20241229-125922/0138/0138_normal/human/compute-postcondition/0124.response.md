Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters, `t[1]` has an ASCII value less than 122, `t[2]` is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive), `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 26. If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `works` is either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`, and `cando` is `True`. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`), and `cando` remains `False`.***
