To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character.
- `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122.
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 26.
- If `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).
- `cando` is `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over `j` starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive). This means `j` will start from the next character in the alphabet after `t[i]` and go up to 'z' (which is the 25th index in the range 0-25).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - `i` must be valid, meaning `i` should be within the bounds of the list `t`.
   - `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than 26 for the loop to have a valid range.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`i` must be within the bounds of `t`**: Since `i` is 2, `t` must have at least 3 characters.
   - **`ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 < 26`**: This ensures that the loop has a valid range. Since `i` is 2, `t[2]` must be a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive).

### Adjusted State:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters.
- `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122.
- `t[2]` must be a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive).
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 26.
- If `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).
- `cando` is `False`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters, `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122, `t[2]` must be a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive), `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 26, if `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1), `cando` is `False`**
