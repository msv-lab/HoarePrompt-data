The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement immediately. No variables are modified by this statement itself, so all existing conditions and variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2`, `scount[j]` is `scount[j] - 1`, `res` includes the character that is the next letter in the alphabet after `t[works]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
