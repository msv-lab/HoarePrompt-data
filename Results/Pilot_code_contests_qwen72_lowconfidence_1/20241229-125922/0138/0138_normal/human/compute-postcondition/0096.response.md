The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently within. No variables are altered by the `break` statement itself, so the values of all variables remain unchanged. However, the program flow is altered to exit the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 26, `cando` is `True` or `False` (unchanged), `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1, `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
