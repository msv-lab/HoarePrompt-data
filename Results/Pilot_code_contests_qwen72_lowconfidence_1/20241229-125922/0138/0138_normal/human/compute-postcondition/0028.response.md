Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`, `i` is 2. If `scount[1] < tcount[1]`, `allgreater` is `False`. If `scount[i] < tcount[i]`, `allgreater` is `False`. Otherwise, `allgreater` retains its previous value determined by the condition `scount[0] >= tcount[0]`.***
