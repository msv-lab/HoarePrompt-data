Initial State: 
- `works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`.
- `t[works]` is a lowercase letter.
- `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25.
- `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 3`.
- `scount[j]` is checked to see if it is greater than 0, and if so, `scount[j]` is decremented by 1.
- `res` includes the character that is 3 positions after `t[works]` in the alphabet.

Code Snippet:
```python
scount[j] -= 1
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. The code snippet decrements the value of `scount[j]` by 1.
2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State:
**`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 3`, `scount[j]` is `scount[j] - 1`, `res` includes the character that is 3 positions after `t[works]` in the alphabet.**
