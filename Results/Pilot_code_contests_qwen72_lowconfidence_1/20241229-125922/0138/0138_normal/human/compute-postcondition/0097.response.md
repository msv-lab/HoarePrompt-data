Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 26. If `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `cando` remains unchanged, `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
