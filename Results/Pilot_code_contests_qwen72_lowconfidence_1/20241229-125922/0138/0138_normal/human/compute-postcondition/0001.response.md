`t` is now a list of characters from the input string. The initial state specified that `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and `t` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. After the execution of the code, `t` is transformed into a list of characters from the new input string, while the length constraints (between 1 and 5000 inclusive) remain valid. The value of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, and their lengths are between 1 and 5000 inclusive.**
