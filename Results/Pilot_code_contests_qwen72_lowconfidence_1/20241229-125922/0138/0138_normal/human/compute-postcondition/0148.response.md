The value `t[i]` is appended to the list `res`. Since `i` is 1, this means `t[1]` is added to `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` is `[t[0], t[1]]`, so after appending `t[1]` again, `res` becomes `[t[0], t[1], t[1]]`.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is greater than 1, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[1]]`, `i` is 1, `scount[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')] -= 1`**
