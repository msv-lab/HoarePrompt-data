The value of `scount[j]` is decremented by 1. Since `scount[j]` was initially greater than 0, after the operation, it will be one less than its initial value. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`, `scount[j]` is greater than or equal to 0, `res` includes the character that is the next letter in the alphabet after `t[works]`**
