The code snippet `scount[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1` performs the following actions:

1. It computes the ASCII value of the character at index `i` in the list `t` using `ord(t[i])`.
2. It subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from this value to get an index into the list `scount`.
3. It decrements the value at this index in `scount` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is a list of characters.
- `scount` is a list of integers representing counts of characters.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at index `ord(t[0]) - ord('a')` in `scount` is decremented by 1.
- The other variables (`works` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`works` is greater than 0, `res` is `[t[0]]`, `i` is 0, `scount[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')] -= 1`**.
