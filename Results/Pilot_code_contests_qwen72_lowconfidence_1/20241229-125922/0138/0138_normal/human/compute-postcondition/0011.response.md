To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the list `t` is not empty. This means `t` must contain at least one character.

2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `s` is already given as a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, so no adjustment is needed for `s`.
   - `t` must be a list of characters from the new input string, and for the loop to execute, `t` must have at least one character.
   - `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, so no adjustment is needed for `scount`.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, and this is the initial state before the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `tcount`.

3. **Loop Variable**:
   - The loop variable `char` will take each character in `t` one by one. Before the loop starts, `char` should be the first character in `t`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is not empty and `char` is set to the first character in `t`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, `char` is the first character in `t`**.
