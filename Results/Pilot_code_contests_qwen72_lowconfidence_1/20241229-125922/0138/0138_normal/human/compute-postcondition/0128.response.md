To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters.
- `t[1]` has an ASCII value less than 122.
- `t[2]` is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive).
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + 1`.
- If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `works` is either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`, and `cando` is `True`.
- Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`), and `cando` remains `False`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the range `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `j` equal to `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 26.

### Adjusted State:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `scount` remains unchanged.
- `tcount` remains unchanged.
- `allgreater` remains `False`.
- `scountcopy` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `works` remains as it was (either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`).
- `cando` remains as it was (either `True` or `False`).

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters, `t[1]` has an ASCII value less than 122, `t[2]` is a lowercase letter (ASCII value between 97 and 122 inclusive), `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `ord(t[2]) - ord('a') + 2`. If `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0, `works` is either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`, and `cando` is `True`. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either -1 or 1 depending on the previous value of `cando`), and `cando` remains `False`.**
