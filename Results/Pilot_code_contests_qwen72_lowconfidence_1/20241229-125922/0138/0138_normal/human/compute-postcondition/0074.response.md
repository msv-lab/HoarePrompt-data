Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with characters appended such that the counts of each character in `s` and `t` are balanced (i.e., `scount` is a list of 26 integers all set to 0), `scount` is a list of 26 integers all set to 0, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`, `allgreater` is `True`, the length of `s` is not equal to the length of `t`.**
