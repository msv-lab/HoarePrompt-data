Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes two input strings `s` and `t`, both of which are non-empty and consist of lowercase Latin letters with lengths between 1 and 5000. The function returns one of the following:

1. **-1**: This occurs in two scenarios:
   - If the character counts of `s` do not allow `t` to be a subsequence of `s` (i.e., for any character `c`, the count of `c` in `s` is less than the count of `c` in `t`).
   - If `s` and `t` have the same length and the character counts of `s` are greater than or equal to those of `t`.

2. **A modified string**: If the character counts of `s` are greater than or equal to those of `t` and `s` is longer than `t`, the function appends characters from `s` to `t` to balance the character counts. The resulting string is then returned.

3. **A partially constructed string**: If the character counts of `s` are not sufficient to make `t` a subsequence of `s` but can still form a part of `t` up to a certain point, the function constructs a new string by:
   - Taking the first `works` characters from `t`.
   - Appending the next available character from `s` that is greater than the `works`-th character in `t` and has a positive count in `s`.
   - Appending the remaining characters from `s` in alphabetical order until all counts are zero.

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
- **Empty Input Strings**: The function assumes that `s` and `t` are non-empty. If either `s` or `t` were empty, the function would need to handle these cases explicitly.
- **Character Count Mismatch**: The function checks if the character counts of `s` are greater than or equal to those of `t` and handles the case where `s` and `t` have the same length. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where `t` is longer than `s` and the character counts do not match.
- **Multiple Valid Solutions**: If multiple valid solutions exist (i.e., multiple ways to balance the character counts or form a valid subsequence), the function does not specify which solution is chosen. This could lead to non-deterministic behavior.
- **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input to ensure that `s` and `t` are indeed non-empty and consist only of lowercase Latin letters. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is invalid.**

In summary, the function aims to determine if `t` can be a subsequence of `s` by balancing character counts or constructing a new string that satisfies the conditions. It returns `-1` if the conditions are not met or a modified string if they are. **
