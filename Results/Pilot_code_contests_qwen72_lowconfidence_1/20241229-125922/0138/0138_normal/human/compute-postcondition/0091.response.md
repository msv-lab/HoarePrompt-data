Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 26. If there exists any character in `scountcopy` with an index greater than `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` that has a count greater than 0, then `cando` is `True`. Otherwise, `cando` remains `False`.**
