To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`.
- `t[works]` is a lowercase letter.
- `res` is the list initially containing the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character that is the next available character in the alphabet after `t[works]` with a positive count in `scount`.
- `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + k]` is decremented by 1 if a valid `k` was found, otherwise `scount` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(26):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(26)` will always execute 26 times because `range(26)` generates a sequence from 0 to 25, regardless of the initial state of the program.

2. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 up to 25.
   - The other variables (`works`, `t`, `res`, `scount`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop will always execute 26 times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initialization of `i` to 0. The other variables remain as they are described in the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `res` is the list initially containing the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character that is the next available character in the alphabet after `t[works]` with a positive count in `scount`, `scount[ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + k]` is decremented by 1 if a valid `k` was found, otherwise `scount` remains unchanged, `i` is 0**
