Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 26. If `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).***
