The code snippet `res.append(t[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `t` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the first element of `t` (i.e., `t[0]`) is appended to `res`.

Since `res` was initially an empty list, after appending `t[0]`, `res` will contain one element, which is `t[0]`.

The other variables (`works` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`works` is greater than 0, `res` is `[t[0]]`, `i` is 0**.
