Postcondition: ***`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 3`. If `scount[j]` > 0, `scount[j]` is decremented by 1, and `res` includes the character that is 3 positions after `t[works]` in the alphabet, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `scount[j]` <= 0, no changes are made to `scount[j]` or `res`.***
