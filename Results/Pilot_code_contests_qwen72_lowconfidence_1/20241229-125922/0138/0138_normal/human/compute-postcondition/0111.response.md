To analyze the final state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop executes and how the variables change during each iteration. Let's break down the process:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character.
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 26.
- `cando` is `False`.
- `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    if scountcopy[j] > 0:
        cando = True
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive).
   - This means the loop will execute if `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') < 25`, which simplifies to `ord(t[i]) < 122` (since `ord('z')` is 122).

2. **Variable Changes**:
   - `j` starts at `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches 25.
   - `cando` becomes `True` if any `scountcopy[j]` is greater than 0 within the loop's range.
   - If `cando` becomes `True`, `works` will be set to 0. Otherwise, `works` remains -1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be 26 (one past the last index in the range).
   - `cando` will be `True` if there exists any `scountcopy[j]` greater than 0 for `j` in the range `[ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 25]`.
   - `works` will be 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` will be -1.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 26, `cando` is `True` if there exists any `scountcopy[j] > 0` for `j` in the range `[ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 25]`, otherwise `cando` is `False`, `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1.**
