The code snippet `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')] -= 1` modifies the `scountcopy` list by decrementing the value at the index corresponding to the ASCII value of the character `t[i]` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character.
- `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122.
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 26.
- If `scountcopy[ord(t[i]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).

After executing the code snippet:
- The value at index `ord(t[1]) - ord('a')` in `scountcopy` is decremented by 1.

Thus, the updated state is:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character.
- `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122.
- `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
- `allgreater` is `False`.
- `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 26.
- If `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1 and `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 26, if `scountcopy[ord(t[1]) - ord('a')]` is 0, `works` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `works` remains as it was (either 1 if `cando` is `True`, or -1).**
