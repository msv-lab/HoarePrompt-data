Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`. If `t` is an empty list, `tcount` remains a list of 26 zeros. `allgreater` is `True`, indicating that for every character `c` in the alphabet, the count of `c` in `s` is greater than or equal to the count of `c` in `t`. Additionally, the length of `s` is equal to the length of `t`.***
