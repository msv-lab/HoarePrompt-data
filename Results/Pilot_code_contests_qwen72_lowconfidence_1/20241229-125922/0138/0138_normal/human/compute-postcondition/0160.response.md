To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`.
- `t[works]` is a lowercase letter.
- `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25.
- `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.
- If `scount[j]` > 0, `res` includes the character that is the next letter in the alphabet after `t[works]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` to 25 (inclusive).
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - `scount[j]` is checked, and if it is greater than 0, certain actions are taken, and the loop may break.

### Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2`.
- **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the condition `j < 26` must still hold true.

State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 2`, `scount[j]` is checked, and if `scount[j]` > 0, `res` includes the character that is the next letter in the alphabet after `t[works]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
