To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop's `range` function will generate a sequence of values for `j`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range Function**: The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) up to, but not including, the second argument. For the loop to execute, the starting value of the range must be less than the ending value.

2. **Starting Value**: The starting value of the range is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.
   - `ord(t[i])` gives the ASCII value of the character `t[i]`.
   - `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of the character 'a'.
   - `ord(t[i]) - ord('a')` gives the position of the character `t[i]` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - Adding 1 to this result gives the starting value of the range.

3. **Ending Value**: The ending value of the range is 26.

4. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute, the starting value must be less than 26.
   - This means `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1 < 26`.
   - Simplifying, `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') < 25`.
   - Since `ord('a')` is 97, this simplifies to `ord(t[i]) < 122` (which is the ASCII value of 'z').

5. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character.
   - `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character.
   - `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`.
   - `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`.
   - `allgreater` is `False`.
   - `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 26.
   - `cando` is `False`.
   - `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1.

6. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute if `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') < 25`.
   - Given that `i` is 1, `t[i]` must be a valid character in the string `t` and its ASCII value must be less than 122.

### Final Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments are needed:
- `t` must be a list of characters where the second character (index 1) has an ASCII value less than 122.
- `j` should be set to the starting value of the range, which is `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `t[1]` must have an ASCII value less than 122, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` with `scountcopy[ord(t[0]) - ord('a')]` decreased by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `ord(t[1]) - ord('a') + 1`, `cando` is `False`, `works` is 0 if `cando` is `True`, otherwise `works` is -1**
