The code snippet `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1` increments the value at the index `ord(char) - ord('a')` in the list `scount` by 1.

Given:
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 3 characters.
- `t` is a list of characters from the new input string.
- `scount[ord(s[2]) - ord('a')]` is 2.
- `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros.
- `char` is the third character in the list `s`.

Since `char` is the third character in the list `s`, and `scount[ord(s[2]) - ord('a')]` is 2, incrementing this value by 1 results in:

- `scount[ord(char) - ord('a')]` becomes 3.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 3 characters, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string, `scount[ord(s[2]) - ord('a')]` is 3, `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros, `char` is the third character in the list `s`.**
