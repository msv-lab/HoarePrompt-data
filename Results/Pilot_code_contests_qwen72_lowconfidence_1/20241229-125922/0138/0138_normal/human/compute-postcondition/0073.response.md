Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with `'a'` appended 0 times plus characters corresponding to the indices where `scount[i]` was initially greater than 0, now including the character `'c'` repeated `scount[2]` times, `scount` is a list of 26 integers where `scount[i]` is 0 for all `i` where the loop executed, `scount[0]` is 0, `tcount[0]` is incremented by the original value of `scount[0]`, `allgreater` is `True`, the length of `s` is not equal to the length of `t`, and `i` is 2**
