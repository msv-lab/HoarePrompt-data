The code `tcount[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1` increments the value at the index corresponding to the character `char` in the list `tcount`. 

- `char` is the third character in `t`.
- The index in `tcount` for `char` is calculated as `ord(char) - ord('a')`.
- Before the increment, `tcount` has 26 zeros except for the elements at indices `ord(t[0]) - ord('a')` and `ord(t[1]) - ord('a')` which are both 1.
- After the increment, the element at index `ord(char) - ord('a')` in `tcount` will be 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was already 1).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 3 characters, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 zeros except for the elements at indices `ord(t[0]) - ord('a')`, `ord(t[1]) - ord('a')`, and `ord(t[2]) - ord('a')` which are 1, 1, and 1 respectively, `char` is the third character in `t`.**
