The code `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `t`. Given that `i` is 0, this means that the character `'a'` (since `ord('a')` is 97 and `0 + 97` is 97, which corresponds to `'a'`) is appended to `t`.

Since `t` initially contains a list of characters from the new input string with `'a'` already appended, appending another `'a'` will increment the count of `'a'` in `t`.

The impact on the other variables:
- `scount` remains unchanged because the operation does not affect the counts in `scount`.
- `tcount` will be updated to reflect the new count of `'a'` in `t`. Since `'a'` was already in `t`, the count of `'a'` in `tcount` will be incremented by 1.
- `allgreater` remains `True` as the condition of `scount[0]` being greater than 0 is still met.
- The lengths of `s` and `t` remain unequal.
- `i` remains 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with `'a'` appended twice, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` minus the count of each corresponding character in `t`, `tcount[0]` is incremented by 1, `allgreater` is `True`, the length of `s` is not equal to the length of `t`, `i` is 0, `scount[0]` must be greater than 0**
