Postcondition: ***`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`. If `scount[j]` > 0, `res` includes the character that is the next letter in the alphabet after `t[works]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
