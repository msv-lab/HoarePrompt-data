The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the context provided, it implicitly works with two strings `s` and `t`. Both `s` and `t` are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and their lengths are between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The function's output depends on the relationship between `s` and `t`:

- Case_1: If certain conditions (not specified in the provided context) are met, the function returns `-1`.
- Case_2: If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not equal and `allgreater` is `True`, the function returns a string formed by joining all characters in the list `t`, where `t` has been modified to balance the counts of each character in `s` and `t`.
- Case_3: Under other unspecified conditions, the function returns `-1`.
- Case_4: The function returns a string that is the concatenation of the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character that is the next available character in the alphabet after `t[works]` with a positive count in `scount`, now including each character from `'a'` to `'z'` repeated according to their respective counts in `scount`. If all elements in `scount` are 0, no additional characters are added, and the returned string consists only of the first `works` elements of `t`.

Functionality: **The function implicitly works with two strings `s` and `t`, both of which are non-empty and consist of lowercase Latin letters with lengths between 1 and 5000. It returns -1 under certain conditions, or a string that either balances the character counts between `s` and `t` or is a concatenation of the first `works` elements of `t` and possibly an additional character based on the character counts in `s`.**
