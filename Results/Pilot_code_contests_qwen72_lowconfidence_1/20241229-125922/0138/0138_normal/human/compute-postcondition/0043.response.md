The code `t.append(chr(i + ord('a')))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `i + ord('a')` to the list `t`. Given that `i` is 0, the character `'a'` is appended to `t`.

Since `t` initially contains characters from a new input string, appending `'a'` updates `t` but does not affect the other variables directly. However, the change in `t` will indirectly affect `tcount` if `tcount` is updated later to reflect the new character count in `t`.

The values of `s`, `scount`, `allgreater`, and the condition that the length of `s` is not equal to the length of `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with `'a'` appended, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s` minus the count of each corresponding character in `t`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of the character `chr(i + ord('a'))` in `t`, `allgreater` is `True`, the length of `s` is not equal to the length of `t`, `i` is 0, and `scount[0]` must be greater than 0**.
