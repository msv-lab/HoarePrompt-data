The code appends the element at index `i` of list `t` to the list `res`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the element `t[2]` is appended to `res`.

Initial State:
- `works` is greater than 2
- `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[1]]`
- `i` is 2
- `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1 from its original value

After executing the code:
- `res` now includes the element `t[2]` at the end, so `res` becomes `[t[0], t[1], t[1], t[2]]`

The values of `works`, `i`, and `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`works` is greater than 2, `res` is `[t[0], t[1], t[1], t[2]]`, `i` is 2, `scount[ord(t[2]) - ord('a')]` is decremented by 1 from its original value**
