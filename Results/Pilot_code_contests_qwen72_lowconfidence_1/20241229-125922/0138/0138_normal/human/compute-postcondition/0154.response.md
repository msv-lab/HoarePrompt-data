To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Range Condition**: The loop `for j in range(ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):` will execute if the starting value of the range (`ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`) is less than the ending value (26). This means `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` must be less than 25.

2. **Variable `t[works]`**: The variable `t[works]` must be a valid character in the string `t`, and it must be a lowercase letter (since `ord('a')` to `ord('z')` correspond to ASCII values 97 to 122).

3. **Index `works`**: The index `works` must be within the bounds of the string `t`.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- **`works`**: Since `works` is a positive integer and is used as an index into the string `t`, it must be less than the length of `t` to avoid an index out of range error.
- **`t[works]`**: The character `t[works]` must be a lowercase letter, and its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a' must be less than 25.
- **`j`**: The loop variable `j` will start from `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1` and go up to 25. Therefore, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` must be less than 25.

Let's summarize the adjusted state:

State: **`works` is a positive integer less than the length of `t`, `t[works]` is a lowercase letter, `ord(t[works]) - ord('a')` is less than 25, `j` is `ord(t[works]) - ord('a') + 1`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
