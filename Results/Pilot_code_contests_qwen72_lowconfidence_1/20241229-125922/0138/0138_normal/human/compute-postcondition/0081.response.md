To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1, 26):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over the range starting from `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` to `26`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of the range (`ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1`) must be less than `26`.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is used to index into the list `t`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the bounds of the list `t` (i.e., `0 <= i < len(t)`).

3. **List `t`**:
   - The list `t` must have at least one element for `t[i]` to be valid.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `t` has at least one element**: This is necessary to avoid an index out of range error.
- **Ensure `i` is 0**: Since `i` is the index used to access the first element of `t`, it should be 0.
- **Ensure the starting value of the range is less than 26**: This means `ord(t[i]) - ord('a') + 1` must be less than 26. Given that `ord('a')` is 97, this condition simplifies to `ord(t[i]) < 122` (which is always true for lowercase letters 'a' to 'z').

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute:

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `t` is a list of characters from the new input string with at least 1 character, `scount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `tcount` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `t`, `allgreater` is `False`, `works` is -1, `scountcopy` is a list of 26 integers representing the count of each character in `s`, `i` is 0, `cando` is `False`**
