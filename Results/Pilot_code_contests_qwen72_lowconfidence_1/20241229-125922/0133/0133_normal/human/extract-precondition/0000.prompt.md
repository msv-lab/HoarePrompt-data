You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input

1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2

5 2 3 3 9


Output


YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

Note

The image below describes the tree (circles and solid lines) and the added edges for each query (dotted lines).

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 
Program:
```
def func_5(i, j):
    (l, r) = (first[i], first[j])
    if l > r:
        (l, r) = (r, l)
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
```
