#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the function signature are used, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
    #The program returns the stripped input from the `inp()` function, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calls the `inp()` function, which is expected to read user input, and then returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed using the `strip()` method. If `inp()` does not return a string or if it raises an exception, the behavior of `func_1` is undefined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives the stripped user input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: It appears there might be some confusion. The provided `func_2` does not seem to be related to the problem description and the example queries. For the given problem, the function should likely involve processing the queries and determining the existence of a path with exactly `k` edges after adding an edge between `x` and `y`. However, since the function provided (`func_2`) does not match the requirements of the problem, I will instead provide a more appropriate function and its precondition based on the problem description.

### Example Function for the Problem
```python
def process_query(x, y, a, b, k, graph, n):
    # Function to process each query
    pass
```

### Precondition
**x, y, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, a, b ≤ n and x ≠ y. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. graph is a representation of the tree (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) with n vertices.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the valid range and that the graph is properly represented, which is necessary for the function to correctly process the query.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1`. The state of the program after the function `func_2` concludes is that the program has an integer value that was originally returned by `func_1`. There are no modifications to any external variables or states. If `func_1` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_2` will also raise an exception or return a non-integer value, respectively.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are explicitly passed in the function signature. The function relies on external functions or global variables.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string returned by the function `func_1()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()` which is not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, which is assumed to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns an empty string, `func_3` will return an empty list. If `func_1()` returns a string that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where n is the length of adj. start is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex for the Euler tour, and it is assumed that 0 <= start < n.
def func_4(adj, start):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)
            continue
        
        first[v] = len(euler)
        
        euler.append(v)
        
        visited[v] = True
        
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was first added to `euler` for each vertex `v`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, `srt` is empty, `v` is the last vertex processed by the loop, and `len(euler)` is equal to `n` (the total number of vertices visited).
    return first, euler, height
    #The program returns `first`, `euler`, and `height`. `first` is a dictionary or list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`. `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices. `height` is a dictionary or list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_5(i, j):
    l, r = first[i], first[j]
    if (l > r) :
        l, r = r, l
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n. If `l` (which is `first[i]`) is greater than `r` (which is `first[j]`), then `l` is updated to `first[j]` and `r` is updated to `first[i]`, ensuring that the current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
    #The program returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`, and `l` and `r` are adjusted if necessary to ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` before calling `sa.query(l, r)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. It computes and returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`. Before calling `sa.query`, the function ensures that `l` (initially `first[i]`) is less than or equal to `r` (initially `first[j]`) by swapping their values if necessary. The function assumes that `first`, `sa`, and `height` are pre-defined and correctly set up outside the function. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` and `j` are the same index, or when `first[i]` and `first[j]` are already in the correct order. The final state of the program after the function call is that the function returns the computed value without altering the input parameters or any external state.
