Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code snippet is incomplete and does not cover the entire logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the following issues can be identified:

1. **Missing Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined to handle input, but they do not actually read the input from the standard input. They call a function `inp()` which is not defined anywhere in the code.

2. **Incomplete Euler Tour and LCA Calculation**: The function `func_4` performs an Euler tour and calculates the height of nodes, but it does not complete the LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) calculation. The variable `sa` used in `func_5` is not defined, and there is no implementation for the segment tree or sparse table that is typically used to answer LCA queries efficiently.

3. **Missing Query Processing**: The code does not include any logic to process the queries. There is no function or loop that reads the queries and determines whether a path of length `k` exists between nodes `a` and `b` after adding the edge between `x` and `y`.

4. **Edge Addition and Removal**: The code does not handle the addition and removal of edges for each query. The problem description states that each query should add an edge and then remove it for the next query, but this is not implemented in the provided code.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
