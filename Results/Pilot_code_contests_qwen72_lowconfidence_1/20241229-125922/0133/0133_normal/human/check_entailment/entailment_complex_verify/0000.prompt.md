You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input

1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2
1 4 1 3 3
4 2 3 3 9
5 2 3 3 9


Output

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided code snippet only includes helper functions and does not contain the main logic to handle the queries as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program is missing the following:

1. **Input Handling**: The program does not read the input for the tree edges and the queries.
2. **Tree Construction**: The program does not construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. **Query Processing**: The program does not process the queries to determine if a path with exactly `k` edges exists after adding the edge between `x` and `y`.

To be considered correct, the program should include the following steps:

1. Read the number of vertices `n`.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree using the `n-1` edges.
3. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to compute the Euler tour, first occurrence indices, and heights of nodes.
4. Read the number of queries `q`.
5. For each query, check if a path with exactly `k` edges exists from vertex `a` to vertex `b` after adding the edge between `x` and `y`.

Since these critical parts are missing, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the function signature are used, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
    #The program returns the stripped input from the `inp()` function, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calls the `inp()` function, which is expected to read user input, and then returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed using the `strip()` method. If `inp()` does not return a string or if it raises an exception, the behavior of `func_1` is undefined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives the stripped user input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: It appears there might be some confusion. The provided `func_2` does not seem to be related to the problem description and the example queries. For the given problem, the function should likely involve processing the queries and determining the existence of a path with exactly `k` edges after adding an edge between `x` and `y`. However, since the function provided (`func_2`) does not match the requirements of the problem, I will instead provide a more appropriate function and its precondition based on the problem description.

### Example Function for the Problem
```python
def process_query(x, y, a, b, k, graph, n):
    # Function to process each query
    pass
```

### Precondition
**x, y, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, a, b ≤ n and x ≠ y. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. graph is a representation of the tree (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) with n vertices.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the valid range and that the graph is properly represented, which is necessary for the function to correctly process the query.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1`. The state of the program after the function `func_2` concludes is that the program has an integer value that was originally returned by `func_1`. There are no modifications to any external variables or states. If `func_1` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_2` will also raise an exception or return a non-integer value, respectively.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are explicitly passed in the function signature. The function relies on external functions or global variables.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string returned by the function `func_1()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()` which is not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, which is assumed to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns an empty string, `func_3` will return an empty list. If `func_1()` returns a string that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where n is the length of adj. start is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex for the Euler tour, and it is assumed that 0 <= start < n.
def func_4(adj, start):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)
            continue
        
        first[v] = len(euler)
        
        euler.append(v)
        
        visited[v] = True
        
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was first added to `euler` for each vertex `v`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, `srt` is empty, `v` is the last vertex processed by the loop, and `len(euler)` is equal to `n` (the total number of vertices visited).
    return first, euler, height
    #The program returns `first`, `euler`, and `height`. `first` is a dictionary or list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`. `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices. `height` is a dictionary or list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_5(i, j):
    l, r = first[i], first[j]
    if (l > r) :
        l, r = r, l
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n. If `l` (which is `first[i]`) is greater than `r` (which is `first[j]`), then `l` is updated to `first[j]` and `r` is updated to `first[i]`, ensuring that the current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
    #The program returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`, and `l` and `r` are adjusted if necessary to ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` before calling `sa.query(l, r)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. It computes and returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`. Before calling `sa.query`, the function ensures that `l` (initially `first[i]`) is less than or equal to `r` (initially `first[j]`) by swapping their values if necessary. The function assumes that `first`, `sa`, and `height` are pre-defined and correctly set up outside the function. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` and `j` are the same index, or when `first[i]` and `first[j]` are already in the correct order. The final state of the program after the function call is that the function returns the computed value without altering the input parameters or any external state.
