You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calls the `inp()` function, which is expected to read user input, and then returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed using the `strip()` method. If `inp()` does not return a string or if it raises an exception, the behavior of `func_1` is undefined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives the stripped user input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1`. The state of the program after the function `func_2` concludes is that the program has an integer value that was originally returned by `func_1`. There are no modifications to any external variables or states. If `func_1` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_2` will also raise an exception or return a non-integer value, respectively.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, which is assumed to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns an empty string, `func_3` will return an empty list. If `func_1()` returns a string that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(adj, start=1):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)

        first[v] = len(euler)
        euler.append(v)
        visited[v] = True
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
    return (first, euler, height)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(i, j):
    (l, r) = (first[i], first[j])
    if l > r:
        (l, r) = (r, l)
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. It computes and returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`. Before calling `sa.query`, the function ensures that `l` (initially `first[i]`) is less than or equal to `r` (initially `first[j]`) by swapping their values if necessary. The function assumes that `first`, `sa`, and `height` are pre-defined and correctly set up outside the function. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` and `j` are the same index, or when `first[i]` and `first[j]` are already in the correct order. The final state of the program after the function call is that the function returns the computed value without altering the input parameters or any external state.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
