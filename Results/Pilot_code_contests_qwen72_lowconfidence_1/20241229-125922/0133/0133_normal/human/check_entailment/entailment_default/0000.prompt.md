You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2
1 4 1 3 3
4 2 3 3 9
5 2 3 3 9


Output


YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

Note

The image below describes the tree (circles and solid lines) and the added edges for each query (dotted lines).

<image>

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calls the `inp()` function, which is expected to read user input, and then returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed using the `strip()` method. If `inp()` does not return a string or if it raises an exception, the behavior of `func_1` is undefined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives the stripped user input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1`. The state of the program after the function `func_2` concludes is that the program has an integer value that was originally returned by `func_1`. There are no modifications to any external variables or states. If `func_1` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_2` will also raise an exception or return a non-integer value, respectively.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, which is assumed to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns an empty string, `func_3` will return an empty list. If `func_1()` returns a string that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''

                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
    return (first, euler, height)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(i, j):
    (l, r) = (first[i], first[j])
    if l > r:
        (l, r) = (r, l)
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. It computes and returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`. Before calling `sa.query`, the function ensures that `l` (initially `first[i]`) is less than or equal to `r` (initially `first[j]`) by swapping their values if necessary. The function assumes that `first`, `sa`, and `height` are pre-defined and correctly set up outside the function. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` and `j` are the same index, or when `first[i]` and `first[j]` are already in the correct order. The final state of the program after the function call is that the function returns the computed value without altering the input parameters or any external state.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
