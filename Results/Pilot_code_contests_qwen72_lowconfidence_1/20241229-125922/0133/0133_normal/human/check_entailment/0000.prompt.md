You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2
1 4 1 3 3
4 2 3 3 9
5 2 3 3 9


Output


YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

Note

The image below describes the tree (circles and solid lines) and the added edges for each query (dotted lines).

<image>

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 
Program:
```
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

#Function 4:
def func_4(adj, start=1):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)
            continue
        first[v] = len(euler)
        euler.append(v)
        visited[v] = True
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
    return (first, euler, height)

#Function 5:
def func_5(i, j):
    (l, r) = (first[i], first[j])
    if l > r:
        (l, r) = (r, l)
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
