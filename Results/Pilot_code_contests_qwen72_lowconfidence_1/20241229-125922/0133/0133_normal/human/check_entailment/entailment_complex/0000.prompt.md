You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input

1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2
1 4 1 3 3
4 2 3 3 9
5 2 3 3 9


Output

Note

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the function signature are used, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
    #The program returns the stripped input from the `inp()` function, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from the user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calls the `inp()` function, which is expected to read user input, and then returns the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed using the `strip()` method. If `inp()` does not return a string or if it raises an exception, the behavior of `func_1` is undefined. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the caller receives the stripped user input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: It appears there might be some confusion. The provided `func_2` does not seem to be related to the problem description and the example queries. For the given problem, the function should likely involve processing the queries and determining the existence of a path with exactly `k` edges after adding an edge between `x` and `y`. However, since the function provided (`func_2`) does not match the requirements of the problem, I will instead provide a more appropriate function and its precondition based on the problem description.

### Example Function for the Problem
```python
def process_query(x, y, a, b, k, graph, n):
    # Function to process each query
    pass
```

### Precondition
**x, y, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, a, b ≤ n and x ≠ y. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. graph is a representation of the tree (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) with n vertices.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the valid range and that the graph is properly represented, which is necessary for the function to correctly process the query.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by the function `func_1`. The state of the program after the function `func_2` concludes is that the program has an integer value that was originally returned by `func_1`. There are no modifications to any external variables or states. If `func_1` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_2` will also raise an exception or return a non-integer value, respectively.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are explicitly passed in the function signature. The function relies on external functions or global variables.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string returned by the function `func_1()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()` which is not specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_1`, which is assumed to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()`. If `func_1()` returns an empty string, `func_3` will return an empty list. If `func_1()` returns a string that contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion to integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where n is the length of adj. start is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex for the Euler tour, and it is assumed that 0 <= start < n.
def func_4(adj, start):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)
            continue
        
        first[v] = len(euler)
        
        euler.append(v)
        
        visited[v] = True
        
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was first added to `euler` for each vertex `v`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, `srt` is empty, `v` is the last vertex processed by the loop, and `len(euler)` is equal to `n` (the total number of vertices visited).
    return first, euler, height
    #The program returns `first`, `euler`, and `height`. `first` is a dictionary or list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`. `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices. `height` is a dictionary or list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_5(i, j):
    l, r = first[i], first[j]
    if (l > r) :
        l, r = r, l
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n. If `l` (which is `first[i]`) is greater than `r` (which is `first[j]`), then `l` is updated to `first[j]` and `r` is updated to `first[i]`, ensuring that the current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
    #The program returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`, and `l` and `r` are adjusted if necessary to ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` before calling `sa.query(l, r)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `i` and `j`, which represent indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree. It computes and returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`. Before calling `sa.query`, the function ensures that `l` (initially `first[i]`) is less than or equal to `r` (initially `first[j]`) by swapping their values if necessary. The function assumes that `first`, `sa`, and `height` are pre-defined and correctly set up outside the function. Edge cases include scenarios where `i` and `j` are the same index, or when `first[i]` and `first[j]` are already in the correct order. The final state of the program after the function call is that the function returns the computed value without altering the input parameters or any external state.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
