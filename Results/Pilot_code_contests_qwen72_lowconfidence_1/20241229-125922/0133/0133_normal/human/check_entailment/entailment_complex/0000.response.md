Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Tree Construction**:
   - The code reads the number of vertices `n` and constructs the adjacency list for the tree using the provided edges. This is done correctly using `func_2` and `func_3`.

2. **Euler Tour and Height Calculation**:
   - The function `func_4` performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree and calculates the first occurrence index, the Euler tour sequence, and the height of each vertex. This is essential for efficiently querying the lowest common ancestor (LCA) and distances between nodes.

3. **Range Query Data Structure**:
   - The `RangeQuery` class is used to efficiently query the minimum height in a range of the Euler tour sequence. This allows for fast LCA queries.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the code calculates three possible path lengths:
     - Direct path from `a` to `b` in the original tree.
     - Path from `a` to `x`, then through the new edge `(x, y)`, and finally from `y` to `b`.
     - Path from `a` to `y`, then through the new edge `(x, y)`, and finally from `x` to `b`.
   - It checks if any of these path lengths can be made to equal `k` by adding an even number of additional edges (since the path can contain the same edges multiple times).

5. **Output**:
   - The code correctly prints "YES" if a valid path of exactly `k` edges exists and "NO" otherwise.

### Verification of Edge Cases:
- **Empty Tree**: The problem guarantees that `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, so an empty tree is not a concern.
- **Single Path Queries**: The code handles single path queries correctly by calculating the direct distance and checking if it matches `k`.
- **Multiple Path Queries**: The code correctly considers the additional paths created by the new edge `(x, y)` and checks if any of these paths can be made to match `k` by adding an even number of edges.
- **Large `k` Values**: The code can handle large values of `k` (up to `10^9`) by checking the parity and difference between the calculated path lengths and `k`.

### Example Validation:
- The provided example input and output are correctly handled by the code:
  - For the first query `(1, 3, 1, 2, 2)`, the path `1 – 3 – 2` is valid.
  - For the second query `(1, 4, 1, 3, 2)`, the path `1 – 2 – 3` is valid.
  - For the third query `(1, 4, 1, 3, 3)`, no valid path exists.
  - For the fourth query `(4, 2, 3, 3, 9)`, the path `3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3` is valid.
  - For the fifth query `(5, 2, 3, 3, 9)`, no valid path exists.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
