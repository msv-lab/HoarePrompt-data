You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: What if we add another edge in a tree?

Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called 1-trees. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.

First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with n vertices, then he will ask you q queries. Each query contains 5 integers: x, y, a, b, and k. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex a to b that contains exactly k edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices x and y. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of vertices of the tree.

Next n-1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u,v ≤ n, u ≠ v) each, which means there is an edge between vertex u and v. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.

Next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.

Next q lines contain five integers x, y, a, b, and k each (1 ≤ x,y,a,b ≤ n, x ≠ y, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between x and y does not exist in the original tree.

Output

For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly k edges from vertex a to b after adding an edge between vertices x and y. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Example

Input


5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
1 3 1 2 2
1 4 1 3 2
1 4 1 3 3
4 2 3 3 9
5 2 3 3 9


Output


YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

Note

The image below describes the tree (circles and solid lines) and the added edges for each query (dotted lines).

Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are: 

  * 1-st query: 1 – 3 – 2 
  * 2-nd query: 1 – 2 – 3 
  * 4-th query: 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 2 – 3 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

"""
NTC here
"""
inp = sys.stdin.readline
out = []
range = xrange
input = raw_input
INF = 10 ** 5 + 7
n = func_2()
adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(n - 1):
    (i, j) = func_3()
    adj[i].append(j)
    adj[j].append(i)
(first, euler, height) = func_4(adj)
euler = [height[i] for i in euler]
class RangeQuery:

    def __init__(self, data, func=min):
        self.func = func
        self._data = _data = [list(data)]
        (i, n) = (1, len(_data[0]))
        while 2 * i <= n:
            prev = _data[-1]
            _data.append([func(prev[j], prev[j + i]) for j in range(n - 2 * i + 1)])
            i <<= 1

    def query(self, begin, end):
        end += 1
        depth = (end - begin).bit_length() - 1
        return self.func(self._data[depth][begin], self._data[depth][end - (1 << depth)])
sa = RangeQuery(euler)
q = func_2()
while q:
    q -= 1
    (x, y, a, b, k) = func_3()
    ans1 = [func_5(a, b), func_5(a, x) + 1 + func_5(y, b), func_5(a, y) + 1 + func_5(x, b)]
    for i in ans1:
        if k - i >= 0 and (k - i) % 2 == 0:
            out.append('YES')
            break
    else:
        out.append('NO')
print('\n'.join(out))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables from the function signature are used, as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return inp().strip()
    #The program returns the stripped input from the `inp()` function, which removes leading and trailing whitespace from the user input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: It appears there might be some confusion. The provided `func_2` does not seem to be related to the problem description and the example queries. For the given problem, the function should likely involve processing the queries and determining the existence of a path with exactly `k` edges after adding an edge between `x` and `y`. However, since the function provided (`func_2`) does not match the requirements of the problem, I will instead provide a more appropriate function and its precondition based on the problem description.

### Example Function for the Problem
```python
def process_query(x, y, a, b, k, graph, n):
    # Function to process each query
    pass
```

### Precondition
**x, y, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, a, b ≤ n and x ≠ y. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. graph is a representation of the tree (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) with n vertices.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the valid range and that the graph is properly represented, which is necessary for the function to correctly process the query.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by `func_1()`

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are explicitly passed in the function signature. The function relies on external functions or global variables.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the string returned by the function `func_1()`. The exact content of the list depends on the output of `func_1()` which is not specified in the initial state.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: adj is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with n vertices, where n is the length of adj. start is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex for the Euler tour, and it is assumed that 0 <= start < n.
def func_4(adj, start):
    n = len(adj)
    visited = [False] * n
    first = [-1] * n
    euler = []
    height = [-1] * n
    srt = [start]
    height[start] = 1
    parent = [-1] * n
    while srt:
        v = srt.pop()
        
        if visited[v]:
            euler.append(v)
            continue
        
        first[v] = len(euler)
        
        euler.append(v)
        
        visited[v] = True
        
        if parent[v] != -1:
            srt.append(parent[v])
        
        for u in adj[v]:
            if not visited[u]:
                parent[u] = v
                height[u] = height[v] + 1
                srt.append(u)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was first added to `euler` for each vertex `v`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, `srt` is empty, `v` is the last vertex processed by the loop, and `len(euler)` is equal to `n` (the total number of vertices visited).
    return first, euler, height
    #The program returns `first`, `euler`, and `height`. `first` is a dictionary or list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`. `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices. `height` is a dictionary or list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i and j are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.
def func_5(i, j):
    l, r = first[i], first[j]
    if (l > r) :
        l, r = r, l
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n. If `l` (which is `first[i]`) is greater than `r` (which is `first[j]`), then `l` is updated to `first[j]` and `r` is updated to `first[i]`, ensuring that the current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
    h = sa.query(l, r)
    return height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h
    #The program returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`, and `l` and `r` are adjusted if necessary to ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` before calling `sa.query(l, r)`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
