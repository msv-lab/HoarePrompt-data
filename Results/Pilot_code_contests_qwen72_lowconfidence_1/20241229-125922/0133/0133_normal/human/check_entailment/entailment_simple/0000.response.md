Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem described, but it has several issues that prevent it from fully meeting the requirements:

1. **Use of Undefined Functions**: The program uses `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_5`, which are not defined within the provided code. These functions are assumed to be placeholders for reading input and performing certain operations, but their actual implementations are missing. This makes it impossible to verify the correctness of the program without these definitions.

2. **Incorrect Function Calls**:
   - `func_2()` is called twice: once for reading `n` and once for reading `q`. However, the second call to `func_2()` should be for reading the number of queries, but it is unclear if this function correctly reads the input as expected.
   - `func_3()` is used to read the edges and queries, but the exact implementation is not provided, making it unclear if it correctly parses the input.

3. **Range and Input Handling**:
   - The use of `xrange` and `raw_input` suggests that the code is written for Python 2, but the problem description implies that the code should be written for Python 3. This could lead to issues with input handling and range generation.
   - The variable `INF` is set to `10 ** 5 + 7`, but it is never used in the program, suggesting that it might be a leftover from a different implementation.

4. **Path Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances using `func_5`, which is supposed to find the distance between two nodes in the tree. However, the implementation of `func_5` relies on the `sa.query` method, which is part of the `RangeQuery` class. The `RangeQuery` class is designed to perform range minimum queries (RMQ), but it is not clear if it is correctly implemented or if it is the right approach for this problem.

5. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program checks if a path with exactly `k` edges exists by considering three possible paths: direct path, path through the added edge, and path through the added edge in reverse. However, the logic for checking if the path length is valid (`if k - i >= 0 and (k - i) % 2 == 0`) might not cover all cases, especially when the tree structure and the added edge create complex paths.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program appends "YES" or "NO" to the `out` list and prints the results at the end. This is generally correct, but the exact implementation of the output formatting should be verified against the problem description.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The missing function definitions, incorrect function calls, and potential logical errors in the path calculation make it difficult to determine if the program will produce the correct output for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
