It appears there might be some confusion. The provided `func_2` does not seem to be related to the problem description and the example queries. For the given problem, the function should likely involve processing the queries and determining the existence of a path with exactly `k` edges after adding an edge between `x` and `y`. However, since the function provided (`func_2`) does not match the requirements of the problem, I will instead provide a more appropriate function and its precondition based on the problem description.

### Example Function for the Problem
```python
def process_query(x, y, a, b, k, graph, n):
    # Function to process each query
    pass
```

### Precondition
**x, y, a, b are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y, a, b ≤ n and x ≠ y. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. graph is a representation of the tree (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) with n vertices.**

This precondition ensures that the input values are within the valid range and that the graph is properly represented, which is necessary for the function to correctly process the query.
