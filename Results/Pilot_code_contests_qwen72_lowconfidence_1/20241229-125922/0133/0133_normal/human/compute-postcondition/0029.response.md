The code snippet `srt.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `srt`.

Given the initial state:
- `adj[v]` must have at least two elements.
- `u` is the second neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`.
- `v` is `start`.
- `visited[v]` is `True`.
- `first[v]` is 1.
- `height[v]` is 1.
- `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent.
- `euler` contains the value of `v`.
- `visited[u]` is `False`.
- `parent[u]` is `v`.
- `height[u]` is 2.
- `srt` contains the value of `u` (if `parent[v]` is `-1`, `srt` was initially empty; otherwise, it already contained `parent[v]`).

After executing the code:
- `srt` now contains the value of `u` appended to its existing content.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `adj[v]` must have at least two elements.
- `u` is the second neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`.
- `v` is `start`.
- `visited[v]` is `True`.
- `first[v]` is 1.
- `height[v]` is 1.
- `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent.
- `euler` contains the value of `v`.
- `visited[u]` is `False`.
- `parent[u]` is `v`.
- `height[u]` is 2.
- `srt` contains the value of `u` and possibly `parent[v]` (if `parent[v]` is not `-1`).

Output State: **`adj[v]` must have at least two elements, `u` is the second neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`, `visited[u]` is `False`, `parent[u]` is `v`, `height[u]` is 2, `srt` contains the value of `u` and possibly `parent[v]` (if `parent[v]` is not `-1`).**
