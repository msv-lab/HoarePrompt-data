The code snippet assigns the value of `v` to `parent[u]`. This updates the `parent` dictionary to indicate that `u`'s parent is `v`.

- `adj[v]` must have at least one element
- `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`
- `v` is `start`
- `visited[v]` is `True`
- `first[v]` is 1
- `height[v]` is 1
- `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent
- `euler` contains the value of `v`
- `srt` is an empty list unless `parent[v]` is not `-1` and then it contains the value of `parent[v]`
- `visited[u]` is `False`
- `parent[u]` is now `v`

Output State: **`adj[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`, `srt` is an empty list unless `parent[v]` is not `-1` and then it contains the value of `parent[v]`, `visited[u]` is `False`, `parent[u]` is `v`**
