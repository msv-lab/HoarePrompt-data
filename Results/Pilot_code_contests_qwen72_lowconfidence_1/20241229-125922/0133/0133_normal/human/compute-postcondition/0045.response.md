The code snippet `srt.append(parent[v])` adds the value of `parent[v]` to the end of the list `srt`.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **`srt`**: The list `srt` is updated by appending the value of `parent[v]` to it.
2. **Other Variables**: All other variables (`adj`, `start`, `n`, `visited`, `first`, `height`, `parent`, `euler`, `v`) remain unchanged.

### Calculation:
- The value of `parent[v]` is appended to the end of the list `srt`.
- The length of `srt` increases by 1.

### Updated Output State:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, including the current `v`, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start` and all values of `v` added during iterations, `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited, `parent[u]` is `start` for all such `u`, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`), and `v` is the last element that was in `srt`. `srt` now includes `parent[v]` as its last element.**
