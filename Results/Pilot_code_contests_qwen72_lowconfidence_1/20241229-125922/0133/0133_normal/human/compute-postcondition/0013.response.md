Postcondition: ***`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n` except `visited[v]` which may be `True` if `v` has been visited, `first` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `euler` is a list containing the value of `start` if `v` has been visited, otherwise it remains an empty list, `height` is a list where `height[start] = 1` and the rest are `-1`, `srt` is an empty list, `parent` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `v` is equal to `start`.***
