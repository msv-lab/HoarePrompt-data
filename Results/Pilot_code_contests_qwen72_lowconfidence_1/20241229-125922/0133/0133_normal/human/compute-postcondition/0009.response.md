The code snippet `v = srt.pop()` removes the last element from the list `srt` and assigns it to the variable `v`. Given that `srt` initially contains only the value of `start`, after this operation, `srt` will be an empty list, and `v` will hold the value of `start`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n`, `first` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `euler` is an empty list, `height` is a list where `height[start] = 1` and the rest are `-1`, `srt` is an empty list, `parent` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `v` is equal to `start`**.
