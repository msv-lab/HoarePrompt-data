Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n. If `l` (which is `first[i]`) is greater than `r` (which is `first[j]`), then `l` is updated to `first[j]` and `r` is updated to `first[i]`, ensuring that the current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.***
