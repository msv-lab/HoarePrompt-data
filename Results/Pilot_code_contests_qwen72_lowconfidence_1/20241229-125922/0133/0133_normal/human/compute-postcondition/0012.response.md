The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there's no loop mentioned in the context, it's implied that this `continue` is within a loop structure that isn't shown. However, since the `continue` statement does not change any variables or data structures directly, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop would proceed to its next iteration.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n` except `visited[v]` which is `True`, `first` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `euler` is a list containing the value of `start`, `height` is a list where `height[start] = 1` and the rest are `-1`, `srt` is an empty list, `parent` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `v` is equal to `start`.**
