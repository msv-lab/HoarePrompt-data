The code snippet swaps the values of `l` and `r`. Initially, `l` is `first[i]` and `r` is `first[j]`, with `l` being greater than `r`. After the swap, `l` will be `first[j]` and `r` will be `first[i]`.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `l` is `first[j]`, `r` is `first[i]`. The current value of `l` is less than the current value of `r`.**
