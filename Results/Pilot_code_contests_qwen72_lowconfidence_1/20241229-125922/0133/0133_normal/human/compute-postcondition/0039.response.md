The code snippet `euler.append(v)` appends the current value of `v` to the list `euler`.

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.
- `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`.
- `n` is the length of `adj`.
- `visited` is a list of booleans where `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited.
- `first[start]` is 1.
- `height[start]` is 1.
- `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent.
- `euler` contains the value of `start`.
- `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited.
- `parent[u]` is `start` for all such `u`.
- `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`).
- `v` is the last element that was in `srt`.

After executing the code:
- `euler` now contains the value of `start` followed by the value of `v`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of booleans where `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, `first[start]` is 1, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start` followed by the value of `v`, `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited, `parent[u]` is `start` for all such `u`, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`), `v` is the last element that was in `srt`.**
