The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no further changes occur to the variables within this specific iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.
- `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`.
- `n` is the length of `adj`.
- `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree.
- `first[start]` is 1.
- `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was added to `euler` for each vertex `v`.
- `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.
- `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root.
- `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v`.
- `srt` is the list with the last element removed.
- `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed.

Since the `continue` statement does not alter any of these variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
