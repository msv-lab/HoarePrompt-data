Postcondition: ***`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, including the current `v`, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start` and all values of `v` added during iterations, `height[u]` is `height[v] + 1`, `height[u]` was previously 3, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`). If `u` is not visited, `u` is appended to the end of `srt`, `height[u]` is `height[v] + 1`, `srt` includes `u` at its end, and `visited[u]` is `False`. `u` is the next neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`. If `u` is not visited, `visited[u]` is `True`, `first[u]` is `len(euler)`, and `euler` contains `u`. If `u` is already visited, the state remains unchanged.***
