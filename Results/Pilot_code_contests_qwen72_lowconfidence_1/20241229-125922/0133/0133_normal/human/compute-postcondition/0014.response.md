The code snippet `first[v] = len(euler)` updates the value of `first[v]` to the current length of the `euler` list. Given that `v` is equal to `start`, and `euler` contains the value of `start` if `v` has been visited, otherwise it remains an empty list, the length of `euler` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `v` (which is `start`) has been visited or not.

If `v` (which is `start`) has been visited, `euler` contains one element, and thus `len(euler)` is 1. If `v` (which is `start`) has not been visited, `euler` is empty, and `len(euler)` is 0.

Therefore, the value of `first[v]` is set to 0 or 1 based on whether `v` (which is `start`) has been visited or not.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n` except `visited[v]` which may be `True` if `v` has been visited, `first` is a list where `first[start]` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `start` has been visited, `euler` is a list containing the value of `start` if `v` has been visited, otherwise it remains an empty list, `height` is a list where `height[start] = 1` and the rest are `-1`, `srt` is an empty list, `parent` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `v` is equal to `start`.**
