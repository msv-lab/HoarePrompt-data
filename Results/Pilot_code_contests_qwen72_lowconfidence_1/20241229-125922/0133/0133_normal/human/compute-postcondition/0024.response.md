The code snippet `srt.append(u)` adds the value of `u` to the list `srt`. 

Given the initial state:
- `adj[v]` must have at least one element.
- `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`.
- `v` is `start`.
- `visited[v]` is `True`.
- `first[v]` is 1.
- `height[v]` is 1.
- `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent.
- `euler` contains the value of `v`.
- `srt` is an empty list unless `parent[v]` is not `-1` and then it contains the value of `parent[v]`.
- `visited[u]` is `False`.
- `parent[u]` is `v`.
- `height[u]` is 2.

After executing the code snippet:
- `srt` now contains the value of `u`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`, `srt` contains the value of `u` (if `parent[v]` is `-1`, `srt` was initially empty; otherwise, it already contained `parent[v]`), `visited[u]` is `False`, `parent[u]` is `v`, `height[u]` is 2.**
