The code `euler.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the end of the list `euler`. This means that `euler` now includes `v` as its last element. The length of `euler` is incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the impact on the program:

- `euler` now includes `v` as its last element.
- The length of `euler` is now `len(euler) + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` as its last element, `srt` is the list with the last element removed, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed, `len(euler)` is `len(euler) + 1`.**
