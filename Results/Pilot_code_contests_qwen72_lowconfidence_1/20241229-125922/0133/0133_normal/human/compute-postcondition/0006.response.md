The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `i` and `j`. Both `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree. The function returns the value of `height[i] + height[j] - 2 * h`, where `h` is the result of `sa.query(l, r)`, and `l` and `r` are adjusted if necessary to ensure `l` is less than or equal to `r` before calling `sa.query(l, r)`.
