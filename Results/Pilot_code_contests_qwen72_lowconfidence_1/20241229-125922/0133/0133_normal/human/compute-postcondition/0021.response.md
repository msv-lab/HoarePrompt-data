Postcondition: ***`adj[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`, `srt` is an empty list unless `parent[v]` is not `-1` and then it contains the value of `parent[v]`. The current value of `visited[u]` is `False`.***
