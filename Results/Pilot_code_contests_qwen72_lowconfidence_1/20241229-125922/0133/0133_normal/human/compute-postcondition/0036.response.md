Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of booleans where `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, `first[start]` is 1, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start`, `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited, `parent[u]` is `start` for all such `u`, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`), `v` is `start`. If `adj[start]` has no unvisited neighbors, the loop does not execute, and the state remains as in the initial state.**
