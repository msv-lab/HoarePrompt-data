The code snippet `parent[u] = v` updates the parent of vertex `u` to be `v`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `parent[u]` is set to `v`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree except for `u`, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `parent[u]` is `v`, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` as its last element, `srt` is the list with the last element removed, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed, `len(euler)` is `len(euler) + 1`, `adj[v]` must not be an empty list, and if `parent[v]` is not `-1`, `srt` is now `srt` with `parent[v]` appended to it. Additionally, `u` has not been visited yet (`visited[u]` is `False`).**
