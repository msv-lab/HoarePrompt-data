The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `adj` and `start`. `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is the length of `adj`. `start` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex for the Euler tour, and it is assumed that `0 <= start < n`.

After executing the function body, the function returns three values:
- `first`: A dictionary or list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`.
- `euler`: A list containing the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices.
- `height`: A dictionary or list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.

Functionality: **The function accepts `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It returns `first`, `euler`, and `height`, where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to `euler`, `euler` is the list of vertices visited in Euler tour order starting from `start`, and `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree.**
