The value of `v` is appended to the list `euler`. Since `v` is equal to `start`, the `euler` list now contains the value of `start`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n` except `visited[v]` which may be `True` if `v` has been visited, `first` is a list where `first[start]` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `start` has been visited, `euler` is a list containing the value of `start`, `height` is a list where `height[start] = 1` and the rest are `-1`, `srt` is an empty list, `parent` is a list of `-1` of length `n`, `v` is equal to `start`.**
