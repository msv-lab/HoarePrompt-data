Postcondition: ***`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is the index at which `v` was added to `euler` for each vertex `v`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` if `visited[v]` is `True`, `srt` is the list with the last element removed, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed.***
