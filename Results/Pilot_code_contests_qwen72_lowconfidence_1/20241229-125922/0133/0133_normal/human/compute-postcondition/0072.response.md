The code snippet `srt.append(parent[v])` appends the parent of the vertex `v` to the list `srt`. Let's break down the impact:

- `srt` is modified by appending `parent[v]` to it. This means the last element of `srt` is now `parent[v]`.
- The length of `srt` increases by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices.
- `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`.
- `n` is the length of `adj`.
- `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree.
- `first[start]` is 1.
- `first[v]` is `len(euler)`.
- `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`.
- `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root.
- `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` as its last element.
- `srt` is the list with the last element removed.
- `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed.
- `len(euler)` is `len(euler) + 1`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `srt` is updated to include `parent[v]` as its new last element.
- The length of `srt` is now `len(srt) + 1`.

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` as its last element, `srt` is the list with the last element removed, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed, `len(euler)` is `len(euler) + 1`, `srt` is now `srt` with `parent[v]` appended to it.**
