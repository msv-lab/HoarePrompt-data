The code snippet `euler.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `euler`. Here's the updated state:

- `euler` now contains the value of `start` and all the values of `v` that were added during the iterations, including the current `v`.
- All other variables (`adj`, `start`, `n`, `visited`, `first`, `height`, `parent`, `srt`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start` and all values of `v` added during iterations, `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited, `parent[u]` is `start` for all such `u`, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`), and `v` is the last element that was in `srt`.**
