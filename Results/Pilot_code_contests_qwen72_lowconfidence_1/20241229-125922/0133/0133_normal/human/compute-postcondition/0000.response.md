The code snippet assigns the values from the list `first` at indices `i` and `j` to the variables `l` and `r`, respectively. Given that `i` and `j` are non-negative integers and are valid indices within the bounds of the list `first`, the values of `l` and `r` are determined by the elements at these indices in the list.

Output State: **`i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing indices such that 0 <= i, j < n, `l` is `first[i]`, `r` is `first[j]`**
