Functionality: ** The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `adj` (a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree) and `start` (a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex). It performs an Euler tour traversal of the tree starting from the specified vertex and returns three values: `first`, `euler`, and `height`. 

- `first` is a list where `first[v]` is the index at which vertex `v` was first added to the `euler` list.
- `euler` is a list containing the order in which vertices were visited during the Euler tour, starting from the `start` vertex and including all vertices.
- `height` is a list where `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, with the root (starting vertex) having a depth of 1.

The function ensures that all vertices are visited, and the `visited` list is updated to `True` for each vertex. The `parent` list is also updated to reflect the parent of each vertex in the tree, with the root having a parent of `-1`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the tree is empty (i.e., `adj` is an empty list), the function will return empty lists for `first`, `euler`, and `height`.
- If the `start` vertex is not connected to any other vertices (i.e., `adj[start]` is an empty list), the function will only include the `start` vertex in the `euler` list, and `first[start]` will be 0, while `height[start]` will be 1.**

Note: The function assumes that the input `adj` represents a valid tree and that `start` is a valid vertex within the tree. If these assumptions are not met, the behavior of the function may be undefined.
