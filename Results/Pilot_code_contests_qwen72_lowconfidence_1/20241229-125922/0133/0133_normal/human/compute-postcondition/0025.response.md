Postcondition: ***`adj[v]` must have at least one element, `u` is the first neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`. If `visited[u]` is `False`, `srt` contains the value of `u` (if `parent[v]` is `-1`, `srt` was initially empty; otherwise, it already contained `parent[v]`). `visited[u]` is `False`, `parent[u]` is `v`, and `height[u]` is 2. If `visited[u]` is `True`, the state remains unchanged as per the precondition.***
