The value of `height[u]` is updated to `height[v] + 1`. Given that `height[v]` is 1, `height[u]` becomes 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`adj[v]` must have at least three elements, `u` is the third neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `v` is `start`, `visited[v]` is `True`, `first[v]` is 1, `height[v]` is 1, `parent[v]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `v`. If `visited[u]` is `False`, `srt` contains the value of `u` and possibly `parent[v]` (if `parent[v]` is not `-1`), `visited[u]` is `False`, `parent[u]` is `v`, `height[u]` is 2.**
