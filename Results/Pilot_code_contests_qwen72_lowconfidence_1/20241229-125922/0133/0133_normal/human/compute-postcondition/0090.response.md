Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is the index where `v` appears in `euler`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, `srt` is a list of vertices in the order they were discovered during the traversal, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed, `len(euler)` is the total number of vertices visited, which is equal to `n` (since all vertices are visited). If the loop does not execute, `srt` will remain unchanged and only the root `start` will be in `euler`.**
