The code snippet `srt.append(u)` appends the variable `u` to the list `srt`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation on the variables and the overall state:

- `srt`: Initially, `srt` is described as a list with the last element removed, and `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed. After appending `u` to `srt`, the last element of `srt` is now `u`.
- `u`: This variable represents the next neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`. It is being added to `srt`.
- All other variables (`adj`, `start`, `n`, `visited`, `first`, `height`, `parent`, `euler`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all vertices `v` in the tree, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[v]` is the depth of vertex `v` in the tree, starting from 1 for the root `start`, `height[u]` is `height[v] + 1`, `parent[v]` is the parent of vertex `v` in the tree, or `-1` if `v` is the root, `euler` contains the order in which vertices were visited, starting with `start` and including all vertices, and now also includes `v` as its last element, `srt` is the list with the last element removed, and now includes `u` as its last element, `v` is the last element of `srt` before it was removed, `len(euler)` is `len(euler) + 1`, `adj[v]` must not be an empty list, if `parent[v]` is not `-1`, `srt` is now `srt` with `parent[v]` appended to it, `u` is the next neighbor of `v` in `adj[v]`, `parent[u]` is `v`, if `visited[u]` is `False`, `srt` now includes `u` as its last element, `visited[u]` remains `False` otherwise.**
