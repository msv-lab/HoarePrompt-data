Postcondition: ***`adj` is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, `start` is a non-negative integer with `0 <= start < n`, `n` is the length of `adj`, `visited[v]` is `True` for all `v` that were neighbors of `start` and not previously visited, including the current `v`, `first[start]` is 1, `first[v]` is `len(euler)`, `height[start]` is 1, `parent[start]` is `-1` or a valid parent, `euler` contains the value of `start` and all values of `v` added during iterations, `height[u]` is `height[v] + 1`, `height[u]` is 2 for all `u` that are direct children of `start` and were not previously visited, `parent[u]` is `v`, `srt` contains the values of all such `u` except the last one and possibly `parent[start]` (if `parent[start]` is not `-1`), `v` is the last element that was in `srt`, `u` is the first neighbor of `v`, `adj[v]` must have at least one element. If `u` has not been visited (`visited[u]` is `False`), `srt` now includes `u` at its end. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
