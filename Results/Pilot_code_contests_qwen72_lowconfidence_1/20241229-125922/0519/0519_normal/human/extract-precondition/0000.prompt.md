You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Quick sort is based on the Divide-and-conquer approach. In QuickSort(A, p, r), first, a procedure Partition(A, p, r) divides an array A[p..r] into two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] such that each element of A[p..q-1] is less than or equal to A[q], which is, inturn, less than or equal to each element of A[q+1..r]. It also computes the index q.

In the conquer processes, the two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] are sorted by recursive calls of QuickSort(A, p, q-1) and QuickSort(A, q+1, r).

Your task is to read a sequence A and perform the Partition based on the following pseudocode:


Partition(A, p, r)
1 x = A[r]
2 i = p-1
3 for j = p to r-1
4     do if A[j] <= x
5        then i = i+1
6            exchange A[i] and A[j]
7 exchange A[i+1] and A[r]
8 return i+1


Note that, in this algorithm, Partition always selects an element A[r] as a pivot element around which to partition the array A[p..r].

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
* 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 100,000

Input

The first line of the input includes an integer n, the number of elements in the sequence A.

In the second line, Ai (i = 1,2,...,n), elements of the sequence are given separated by space characters.

Output

Print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character. The element which is selected as the pivot of the partition should be indicated by [  ].

Example

Input

12
13 19 9 5 12 8 7 4 21 2 6 11


Output

9 5 8 7 4 2 6 [11] 21 13 19 12
Function definition:
```
def func_1(a, p, r):
```
