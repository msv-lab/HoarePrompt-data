Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and two non-negative integers `p` and `r` where `0 ≤ p ≤ r < len(a)`. It partitions the sublist `a[p:r+1]` such that all elements less than or equal to `a[r]` (the pivot) are moved to the left of the pivot, and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right. The function then places the pivot in its correct position within the sorted sublist and returns the index of the pivot. The final state of the list `a` is such that `a[p:i+1]` contains elements less than or equal to the pivot, and `a[i+2:r+1]` contains elements greater than the pivot, where `i + 1` is the returned index. The pivot element, originally at `a[r]`, is now at `a[i + 1]`. Edge cases include when `p == r` (the sublist contains only one element), in which case the function returns `r`, and when all elements in the sublist are equal to the pivot, in which case the function still correctly partitions the list and returns the appropriate index. **
