The value of `i` is set to `p - 1`. The other variables (`a`, `p`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions for these variables still hold.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000, `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p ≤ r < len(a), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p - 1`**
