Output State: **The program returns the index `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`. The value `x` is originally `a[r]`, and after the operation, `a[i + 1]` is equal to `x`, and `a[r]` is equal to the original value of `a[i + 1]`.**
