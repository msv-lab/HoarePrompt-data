To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to consider the initial conditions and the logic within the loop. Let's analyze this step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\).
- `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p \leq r < \text{len}(a)\).
- `x` is equal to `a[r]`.
- `i` is initialized to `p - 1`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(p, r):
    if a[j] <= x:
        i += 1
        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `p` to `r-1` (inclusive).
   - For each `j` in this range, if `a[j]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is incremented, and the elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` are swapped.

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be the last index where an element less than or equal to `x` was found.
   - All elements `a[p]` to `a[i]` will be less than or equal to `x`.
   - All elements `a[i+1]` to `a[r-1]` will be greater than `x`.

### Final State:
- `a` will be partitioned such that all elements from `a[p]` to `a[i]` are less than or equal to `x`, and all elements from `a[i+1]` to `a[r-1]` are greater than `x`.
- `i` will be the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`.
- `x` will still be equal to `a[r]`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\). `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p \leq r < \text{len}(a)\). `x` is equal to `a[r]`. After the loop, all elements `a[p]` to `a[i]` are less than or equal to `x`, and all elements `a[i+1]` to `a[r-1]` are greater than `x`. `i` is the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`.**
