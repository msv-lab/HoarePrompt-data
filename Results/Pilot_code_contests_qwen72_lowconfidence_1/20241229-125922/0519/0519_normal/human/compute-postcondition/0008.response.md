The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` was `p` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`, or `p - 1` otherwise, the new value of `i` will be `p + 1` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`, or `p` otherwise. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p + 1` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, `i` is `p`, `j` is `p + 1`, and `p + 1 < r`**
