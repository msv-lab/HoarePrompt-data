Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\). `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\). `x` is equal to `a[r]`. If `a[j]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` is updated by swapping `a[i]` and `a[j]`. If `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is `p + 1` and `j` remains `p + 1`. Otherwise, `i` is `p` and `j` remains `p + 1`. If `a[j]` is greater than `x`, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
