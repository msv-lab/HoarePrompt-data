Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p - 1`, `j` is `p`. The current value of `a[j]` is less than or equal to `x`.***
