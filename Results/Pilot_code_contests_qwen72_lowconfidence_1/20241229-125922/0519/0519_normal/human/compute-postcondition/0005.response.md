The values of `a[i]` and `a[j]` are swapped. Given that `i` and `j` are both equal to `p`, this means that the elements at index `p` in the list `a` are swapped with themselves, resulting in no actual change to the list `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p`, `j` is `p`, and `a[p]` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p`, `j` is `p`, and `a[p]` remains unchanged.**
