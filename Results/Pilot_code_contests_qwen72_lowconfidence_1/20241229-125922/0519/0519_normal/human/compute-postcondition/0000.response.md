The value of `x` is assigned the value of the element at index `r` in the list `a`. The values of `p` and `r` remain unchanged, and the properties of `a` also remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(a) ≤ 100,000 and 0 ≤ ai ≤ 100,000, `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p ≤ r < len(a), `x` is equal to `a[r]`**.
