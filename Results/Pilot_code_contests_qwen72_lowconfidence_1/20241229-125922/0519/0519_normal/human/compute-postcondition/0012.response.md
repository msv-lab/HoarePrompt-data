The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since the specific values of `a`, `p`, `r`, `x`, `i`, and `j` are not explicitly given, we can only describe the changes in terms of their relationships.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `r`.**
