To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\).
- `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p \leq r < \text{len}(a)\).
- `x` is equal to `a[r]`.
- `i` is `p - 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(p, r):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop `for j in range(p, r)` will iterate over the values from `p` to `r-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value. This means \(p\) must be less than \(r\).

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `p` and `r` are already defined such that \(0 \leq p \leq r < \text{len}(a)\). This ensures that `p` and `r` are within valid bounds of the list `a`.
   - `i` is initialized to `p - 1`. This value does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it might be used inside the loop body.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if \(p < r\). If \(p = r\), the range `range(p, r)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state to reflect the condition \(p < r\).

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p - 1`, `j` is `p`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once because \(p < r\).
