The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `a`, `p`, and `r`. `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, and each element in the list is between 0 and 100,000 inclusive. `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that `0 ≤ p ≤ r < len(a)`.

The function returns the index `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`. The value `x` is originally `a[r]`, and after the operation, `a[i + 1]` is equal to `x`, and `a[r]` is equal to the original value of `a[i + 1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and two non-negative integers `p` and `r`. It returns the index `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`. The value `x` is originally `a[r]`, and after the operation, `a[i + 1]` is equal to `x`, and `a[r]` is equal to the original value of `a[i + 1]`.**
