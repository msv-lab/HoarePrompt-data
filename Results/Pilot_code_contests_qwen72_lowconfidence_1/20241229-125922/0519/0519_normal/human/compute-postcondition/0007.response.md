To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\).
- `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\).
- `x` is equal to `a[r]`.
- `i` is `p - 1`.
- `j` is `p`.
- If `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`, then `i` is incremented to `p` and `j` remains `p`, with `a[p]` remaining unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(p, r):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range from `p` to `r-1` (inclusive of `p` and exclusive of `r`).
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `p`.
   - `i` is `p` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, `i` is `p - 1`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `j`**: The loop increments `j` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- **Check Range**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `r`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented to `p + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `r`.

### Final State:
- `a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\).
- `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\).
- `x` is equal to `a[r]`.
- `i` is `p` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, `i` is `p - 1`.
- `j` is `p + 1`.
- The loop will execute again if `p + 1 < r`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `i` is `p` if `a[p]` is less than or equal to `x`; otherwise, `i` is `p - 1`, `j` is `p + 1`, and `p + 1 < r`**.
