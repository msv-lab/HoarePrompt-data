Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\), `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p < r < \text{len}(a)\), `x` is equal to `a[r]`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `a[j-1]` is less than or equal to `x`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `a[i-1]` and `a[j-1]` are swapped. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `r`.***
