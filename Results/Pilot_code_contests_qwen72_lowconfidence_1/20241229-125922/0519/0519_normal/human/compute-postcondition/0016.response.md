The code snippet swaps the values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[r]`.

- Initially, `x` is equal to `a[r]`.
- After the swap, `a[i + 1]` will take the value of `x` (which was `a[r]`), and `a[r]` will take the value of `a[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the value of `a[i + 1]` becomes `x`, and the value of `a[r]` becomes the original value of `a[i + 1]`.

The rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 100,000\) and \(0 \leq a_i \leq 100,000\). `p` and `r` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq p \leq r < \text{len}(a)\). `x` is equal to `a[r]`. After the loop, all elements `a[p]` to `a[i]` are less than or equal to `x`, and all elements `a[i+1]` to `a[r-1]` are greater than `x`. `i` is the index of the last element in the segment from `a[p]` to `a[r-1]` that is less than or equal to `x`. `a[i + 1]` is now equal to `x`, and `a[r]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i + 1]`.**
