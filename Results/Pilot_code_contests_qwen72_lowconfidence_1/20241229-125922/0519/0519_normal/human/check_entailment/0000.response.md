Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the call to `func_1`. The third argument passed to `func_1` is `data[-1]`, which is the last element of the array. However, according to the problem description, the third argument should be the index of the last element, not the value itself. This means the correct call should be `func_1(data, 0, n-1)` instead of `func_1(data, 0, data[-1])`.

This error will cause the partitioning to fail because the function expects an index, but it receives the value of the last element. For example, if the input is:

```
12
13 19 9 5 12 8 7 4 21 2 6 11
```

The program will incorrectly call `func_1(data, 0, 11)` instead of `func_1(data, 0, 11)`, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially causing an index out of range error or incorrect partitioning. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
