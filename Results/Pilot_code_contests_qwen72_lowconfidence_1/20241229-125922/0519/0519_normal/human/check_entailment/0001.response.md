Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has an issue with how the `func_1` function is called. Specifically, the second argument to `func_1` should be the starting index of the array segment to be partitioned, which is `0`, but the third argument should be the ending index, which is `n-1` (the last valid index of the array). However, in the provided code, the third argument is incorrectly passed as `data[-1]`, which is the last element of the array, not its index. This will cause the function to behave incorrectly and potentially lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect partitioning.

To fix this, the call to `func_1` should be:

```python
pat = func_1(data, 0, n - 1)
```

This ensures that the function receives the correct indices for the partitioning process.
