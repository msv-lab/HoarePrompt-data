Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `data`, `0`, and `data[-1]`. However, the third parameter should be `len(data) - 1` instead of `data[-1]`. The correct call should be `func_1(data, 0, len(data) - 1)`. The current implementation uses the last element of the array as the pivot, but the function expects the index of the pivot, not the value itself.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The output format specified in the problem description requires the pivot element to be enclosed in square brackets. The program correctly prints the pivot element in square brackets, but it does not ensure that the pivot element is correctly placed in the array after the partitioning. The pivot element should be at the position returned by `func_1`.

3. **Partitioning Logic**:
   - The partitioning logic in `func_1` is correct. It places the pivot element in the correct position and ensures that all elements to the left of the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot, and all elements to the right are greater than the pivot. However, the issue lies in how the function is called and the final output format.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin

n = int(stdin.readline())
data = [int(s) for s in stdin.readline().split()]

def func_1(a, p, r):
    x = a[r]
    i = p - 1
    for j in range(p, r):
        if a[j] <= x:
            i += 1
            a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
    a[i + 1], a[r] = a[r], a[i + 1]
    return i + 1

pat = func_1(data, 0, len(data) - 1)
print(*data[:pat], end=' ')
print('[{}]'.format(data[pat]), *data[pat + 1:])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is now called with the correct parameters: `data`, `0`, and `len(data) - 1`.
- **Output Format**: The output format is correctly handled by printing the elements before the pivot, the pivot itself enclosed in square brackets, and the elements after the pivot.

This corrected program will now meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
