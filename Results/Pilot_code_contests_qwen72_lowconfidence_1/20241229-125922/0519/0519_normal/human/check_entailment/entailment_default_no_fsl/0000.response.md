Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the partitioning logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called with incorrect parameters. The problem description specifies that the function `Partition(A, p, r)` should be called with `p` as the starting index and `r` as the ending index of the array segment to be partitioned. However, in the given code, the function `func_1` is called with `data[-1]` as the third argument, which is incorrect because `data[-1]` is the last element of the array, not the index of the last element.

The correct call should be:
```python
pat = func_1(data, 0, n-1)
```

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the array has only one element (`p == r`). While the function `func_1` should return `r` in this case, the current implementation does not explicitly handle this edge case, although it may still work correctly due to the nature of the loop and the pivot placement.

To ensure correctness, the program should be modified to correctly call `func_1` with the proper indices and handle edge cases appropriately.
