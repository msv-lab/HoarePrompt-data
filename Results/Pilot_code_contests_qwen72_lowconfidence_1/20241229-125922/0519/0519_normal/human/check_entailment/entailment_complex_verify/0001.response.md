Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The primary issue lies in the way the `func_1` function is called. Specifically, the third argument to `func_1` should be the ending index of the array segment to be partitioned, which is `n-1` (the last valid index of the array). However, in the provided code, the third argument is incorrectly passed as `data[-1]`, which is the last element of the array, not its index. This will cause the function to behave incorrectly and potentially lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect partitioning.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is designed to work correctly when provided with the correct indices. However, the incorrect call to `func_1` with `data[-1]` as the third argument invalidates the correctness of the program as a whole. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
