Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the partitioning step of the QuickSort algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the function `func_1` is called and the parameters it receives. The function `func_1` expects three arguments: the list `a`, the starting index `p`, and the ending index `r`. However, in the main part of the code, the function is called with `func_1(data, 0, data[-1])`, where `data[-1]` is the last element of the list, not the last index of the list. This will cause the function to behave incorrectly because it expects an index, not a value.

To fix this, the function should be called with the correct indices:

```python
pat = func_1(data, 0, n - 1)
```

Additionally, the output format should match the problem description exactly, including the placement of the pivot element in brackets. The current implementation correctly prints the pivot element in brackets, but it is essential to ensure that the rest of the output matches the expected format.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin

n = int(stdin.readline())
data = [int(s) for s in stdin.readline().split()]
pat = func_1(data, 0, n - 1)
print(*data[:pat], end=' ')
print('[{}]'.format(data[pat]), *data[pat + 1:])

def func_1(a, p, r):
    x = a[r]
    i = p - 1
    for j in range(p, r):
        if a[j] <= x:
            i += 1
            (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    (a[i + 1], a[r]) = (a[r], a[i + 1])
    return i + 1
```

With these corrections, the program should meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
