Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The issue identified in the original assessment is indeed present in the provided code. Specifically, the call to `func_1` is incorrect:

```python
pat = func_1(data, 0, data[-1])
```

Here, `data[-1]` is the last element of the array, not the last index of the array. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function `func_1` expects the third argument to be the last index of the array segment to be partitioned, which should be `n - 1` (where `n` is the length of the array). Therefore, the correct call should be:

```python
pat = func_1(data, 0, n - 1)
```

This ensures that the function receives the correct indices for the partitioning process, and the partitioning will be performed correctly. The current implementation will likely lead to incorrect partitioning or out-of-bounds errors, making the program incorrect according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
