You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Quick sort is based on the Divide-and-conquer approach. In QuickSort(A, p, r), first, a procedure Partition(A, p, r) divides an array A[p..r] into two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] such that each element of A[p..q-1] is less than or equal to A[q], which is, inturn, less than or equal to each element of A[q+1..r]. It also computes the index q.

In the conquer processes, the two subarrays A[p..q-1] and A[q+1..r] are sorted by recursive calls of QuickSort(A, p, q-1) and QuickSort(A, q+1, r).

Your task is to read a sequence A and perform the Partition based on the following pseudocode:


Partition(A, p, r)
1 x = A[r]
2 i = p-1
3 for j = p to r-1
4     do if A[j] <= x
5        then i = i+1
6            exchange A[i] and A[j]
7 exchange A[i+1] and A[r]
8 return i+1


Note that, in this algorithm, Partition always selects an element A[r] as a pivot element around which to partition the array A[p..r].

Constraints

* 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
* 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 100,000

Input

The first line of the input includes an integer n, the number of elements in the sequence A.

In the second line, Ai (i = 1,2,...,n), elements of the sequence are given separated by space characters.

Output

Print the sorted sequence. Two contiguous elements of the sequence should be separated by a space character. The element which is selected as the pivot of the partition should be indicated by [  ].

Example

Input

12
13 19 9 5 12 8 7 4 21 2 6 11


Output

9 5 8 7 4 2 6 [11] 21 13 19 12
Program:
```
from __future__ import division, print_function
from sys import stdin

n = int(stdin.readline())
data = [int(s) for s in stdin.readline().split()]
pat = func_1(data, 0, data[-1])
print(*data[:pat], end=' ')
print('[{}]'.format(data[pat]), *data[pat + 1:])

def func_1(a, p, r):
    x = a[r]
    i = p - 1
    for j in range(p, r):
        if a[j] <= x:
            i += 1
            (a[i], a[j]) = (a[j], a[i])
    (a[i + 1], a[r]) = (a[r], a[i + 1])
    return i + 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the call to `func_1`. The third argument passed to `func_1` is `data[-1]`, which is the last element of the array. However, according to the problem description, the third argument should be the index of the last element, not the value itself. This means the correct call should be `func_1(data, 0, n-1)` instead of `func_1(data, 0, data[-1])`.

This error will cause the partitioning to fail because the function expects an index, but it receives the value of the last element. For example, if the input is:

```
12
13 19 9 5 12 8 7 4 21 2 6 11
```

The program will incorrectly call `func_1(data, 0, 11)` instead of `func_1(data, 0, 11)`, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially causing an index out of range error or incorrect partitioning. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and two non-negative integers `p` and `r` where `0 ≤ p ≤ r < len(a)`. It partitions the sublist `a[p:r+1]` such that all elements less than or equal to `a[r]` (the pivot) are moved to the left of the pivot, and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right. The function then places the pivot in its correct position within the sorted sublist and returns the index of the pivot. The final state of the list `a` is such that `a[p:i+1]` contains elements less than or equal to the pivot, and `a[i+2:r+1]` contains elements greater than the pivot, where `i + 1` is the returned index. The pivot element, originally at `a[r]`, is now at `a[i + 1]`. Edge cases include when `p == r` (the sublist contains only one element), in which case the function returns `r`, and when all elements in the sublist are equal to the pivot, in which case the function still correctly partitions the list and returns the appropriate index.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
