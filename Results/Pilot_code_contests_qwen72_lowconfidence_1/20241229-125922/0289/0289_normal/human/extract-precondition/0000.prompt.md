You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.

The diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset {1, 3, 2, 1} is 2.

Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.

You are given n points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed d?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 100) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the points.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.

Examples

Input

3 1
2 1 4


Output

1


Input

3 0
7 7 7


Output

0


Input

6 3
1 3 4 6 9 10


Output

3

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate 4. The remaining points will have coordinates 1 and 2, so the diameter will be equal to 2 - 1 = 1.

In the second test case the diameter is equal to 0, so its is unnecessary to remove any points. 

In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates 1, 9 and 10. The remaining points will have coordinates 3, 4 and 6, so the diameter will be equal to 6 - 3 = 3.
Function definition:
```
