The code snippet `B.append(int(V[i]))` appends the integer value of the first element in the list `V` (which is `V[0]` since `i` is 0) to the list `B`.

- `B` was initially an empty list and now contains one element, which is the integer value of `V[0]`.
- `i` remains 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, `Q`, `g`, `W`, `V`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a non-empty string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace and must have at least one substring, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer value of `V[0]`, `i` is 0**
