To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100.
   - `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
   - `R` is a string input by the user.
   - `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace.
   - `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`.
   - `W` is a string input by the user.
   - `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace.
   - `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2.
   - `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`.
   - `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists.
   - If `k == l`, `rm_elem_lower` is `[A[0]]` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `rm_elem_lower` remains an empty list.
   - `rm_elem_upper` is an empty list.
   - `rm_elem_total` is `[A[0]]` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `rm_elem_total` is an empty list.
   - `count` is `l - k + 1` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `count` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `A[k] - A[i] <= g`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is determined based on the condition `A[k] - A[i] > g`. If no such `k` exists, `k` is set to `l`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `A[k] - A[i]` must be less than or equal to `g`.
   - Given `i` is 2, we need to ensure that there is at least one `k` such that `A[k] - A[2] <= g`.

5. **Ensuring Execution**:
   - We need to ensure that `A[k] - A[2] <= g` for some `k`.
   - This means that the difference between the third element (index 2) and any subsequent element in the sorted list `A` should not exceed `g`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state so that there is at least one `k` such that `A[k] - A[2] <= g`. This can be achieved by ensuring that the elements in `A` are close enough to each other.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, and `A[2]` is such that there exists at least one `k` where `A[k] - A[2] <= g`.**
