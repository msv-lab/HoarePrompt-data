To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
```

This loop will continue executing as long as the difference between the element at index `k` and the element at index `i` in the sorted list `A` is less than or equal to `g`.

### Current State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0
- `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`
- `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order
- `i` is 1
- `k` is 3
- `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list
- `count` is updated to `l - k`
- `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`
- `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`
- If `k == l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `A[k] - A[i] <= g`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 3
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers
   - `g` is a fixed integer

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the condition `A[k] - A[i] <= g` must still hold true after the current iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is likely to be incremented in the loop body. If `i` is incremented to 2, the new condition will be `A[k] - A[2] <= g`.
- **`A`**: The list `A` remains sorted, so no changes are needed to `A`.
- **`g`**: The value of `g` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be incremented to 2. All other states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list, `count` is updated to `l - k`, `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`, `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`**.
