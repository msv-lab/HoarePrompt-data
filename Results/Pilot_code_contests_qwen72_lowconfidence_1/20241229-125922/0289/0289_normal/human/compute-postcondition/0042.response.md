To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `A[k] - A[i] <= g`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100.
   - `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
   - `R` is a string input by the user.
   - `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace.
   - `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`.
   - `W` is a string input by the user.
   - `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace.
   - `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0.
   - `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`.
   - `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order.
   - `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists.
   - `i` is 1.
   - If `k == l`, then `count` is updated to `l - k`.
   - `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list.
   - `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`.
   - `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g`.
   - `i` is 1 initially.

4. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute if `A[k] - A[i] <= g`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the condition becomes `A[k] - A[1] <= g`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `A[k] - A[1]` must be less than or equal to `g`.
   - Since `A` is sorted in ascending order, `A[1]` is the second smallest element in `A`.
   - `k` is determined such that `A[k] - A[1] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists.
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `A[k] - A[1] <= g`.

6. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - Ensure that `A[k] - A[1] <= g` holds true. This can be achieved by adjusting the values in `A` or ensuring that `k` is not too large.
   - However, since `A` is derived from `B` and `B` is derived from `V`, and `V` is derived from `W`, we cannot directly adjust `A`. Instead, we need to ensure that the values in `V` (and thus `B` and `A`) are such that the condition holds.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if `A[k] - A[1] <= g`. Since `A` is sorted and `i` is 1, the condition `A[k] - A[1] <= g` must hold true for the loop to execute. If `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[1] > g`, then `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustment if the initial conditions are met. The loop will execute if `A[k] - A[1] <= g`.
