The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block immediately. However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, it is assumed that the `break` statement is within a context (such as a loop or if statement) that is not shown. Given this, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program exits the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, and `A[2]` is such that there exists at least one `k` where `A[k] - A[2] <= g`. The current value of `k` is `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
