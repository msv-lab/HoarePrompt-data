To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must hold for the loop to continue.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(l):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Variable `i`**:
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.
   - Since `i` is 2 at the start of the next iteration, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `l` must be greater than 2.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, `Q`, `g`, `W`, `V`, `B`, `A`, `k`, `rm_elem_lower`, `rm_elem_upper`, `rm_elem_total`, and `count`) do not change as a direct result of the loop increment. They remain the same unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 2
- `l` must be greater than 2 (to ensure the loop can execute again)

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists. If `k == l`, `rm_elem_lower` is `[A[0]]` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `rm_elem_lower` remains an empty list, `rm_elem_upper` is an empty list, `rm_elem_total` is `[A[0]]` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `rm_elem_total` is an empty list, and `count` is `l - k + 1` if `l - k + i < count`, otherwise `count` is 0.**
