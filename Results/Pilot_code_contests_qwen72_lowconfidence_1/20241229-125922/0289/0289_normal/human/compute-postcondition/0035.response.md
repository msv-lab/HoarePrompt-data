The code `rm_elem_upper = A[k:]` creates a new list `rm_elem_upper` which contains the elements from list `A` starting from index `k` to the end. This operation does not modify the original list `A` or any other variables directly. The variables `n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, `Q`, `g`, `W`, `V`, `l`, `B`, `A`, `count`, `k`, `i`, and `rm_elem_lower` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `count` is `l - k`, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, `i` is 0, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list, `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`.**
