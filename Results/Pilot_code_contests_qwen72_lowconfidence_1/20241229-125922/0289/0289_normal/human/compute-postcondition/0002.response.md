The code snippet assigns the second element of the list `Q` (converted to an integer) to the variable `g`. The previous values of `n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, and `Q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`.**
