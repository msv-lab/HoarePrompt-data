The code snippet `B.append(int(V[i]))` adds the integer value of `V[i]` to the list `B`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a non-empty string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace and must have at least two substrings
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 1
- `B` is a list containing the integer value of `V[0]`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code:

- `B` now contains the integer value of `V[0]` and the integer value of `V[1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a non-empty string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace and must have at least two substrings, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 1, `B` is a list containing the integer value of `V[0]` and the integer value of `V[1]`, `i` is 1**
