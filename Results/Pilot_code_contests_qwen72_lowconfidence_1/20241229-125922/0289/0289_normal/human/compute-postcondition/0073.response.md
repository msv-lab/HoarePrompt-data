The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is within. Since no loop or conditional structure is explicitly mentioned in the context provided, we assume it breaks out of such a structure. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is incremented by 1, `A[k] - A[2] <= g` if `k < l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
