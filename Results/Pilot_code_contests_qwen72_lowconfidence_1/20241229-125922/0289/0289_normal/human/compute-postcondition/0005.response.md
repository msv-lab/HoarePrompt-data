The code snippet `l = len(V)` assigns the length of the list `V` to the variable `l`. Since `V` is defined as a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` will be the number of substrings in `V`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V`.**
