Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, and if `k == l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `A[k] - A[2] <= g` if `k < l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
