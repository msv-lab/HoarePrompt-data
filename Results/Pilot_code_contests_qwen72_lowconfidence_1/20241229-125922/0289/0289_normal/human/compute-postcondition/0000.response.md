The code snippet `R = raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `R`. The variables `n`, `d`, and `xi` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, d is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, xi is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, R is a string input by the user.**
