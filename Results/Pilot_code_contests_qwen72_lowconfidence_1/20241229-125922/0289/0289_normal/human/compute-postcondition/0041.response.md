To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0
- `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`
- `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order
- `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists
- `i` is 0
- If `k == l`, then `count` is updated to `l - k`
- `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list
- `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`
- `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`
- The most internal loop or if statement is exited

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, `Q`, `g`, `W`, `V`, `l`, `B`, `A`, `k`, `count`, `rm_elem_lower`, `rm_elem_upper`, `rm_elem_total`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is omitted.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- All other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, `i` is 1, if `k == l`, then `count` is updated to `l - k`, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list, `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`, `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`**
