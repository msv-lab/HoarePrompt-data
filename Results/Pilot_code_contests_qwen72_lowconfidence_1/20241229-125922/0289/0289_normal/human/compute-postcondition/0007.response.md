To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions and variables involved:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for i in range(l):` will execute if `l` (the number of substrings in `V`) is greater than 0.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100.
   - `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100.
   - `R` is a string input by the user.
   - `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace.
   - `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`.
   - `W` is a string input by the user.
   - `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace.
   - `l` is the number of substrings in `V`.
   - `B` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `l` must be greater than 0. This means `V` must have at least one substring. Therefore, `W` must be a non-empty string.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `l` must be greater than 0.
- `V` must have at least one substring.
- `W` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given these adjustments, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a non-empty string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace and must have at least one substring, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.
