To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V`
- `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V` if `l` > 0, otherwise `B` is an empty list
- `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order
- `count` is equal to `l`
- `k` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(l):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `l` (the number of substrings in `V`) is greater than 0.
- The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 up to `l-1`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `l` is greater than 0. Additionally, we need to initialize `i` to 0.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `count` is equal to `l`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0**
