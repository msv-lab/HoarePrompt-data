The value of `k` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Since `k` was defined as the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, incrementing `k` by 1 means it now points to the next position in the list `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, and `A[2]` is such that there exists at least one `k` where `A[k] - A[2] <= g`, `k` is incremented by 1.**
