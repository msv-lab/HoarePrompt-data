The code snippet `rm_elem_lower = A[:i]` creates a new list `rm_elem_lower` that contains the elements of the list `A` from the beginning up to (but not including) the index `i`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 0.

Since `i` is 0, `A[:i]` means `A[:0]`, which is an empty list because it includes elements from the start of `A` up to but not including the first element.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `count` is `l - k`, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, `i` is 0, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list.**
