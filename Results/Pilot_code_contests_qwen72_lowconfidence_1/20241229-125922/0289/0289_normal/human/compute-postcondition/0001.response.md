The code `Q = R.split()` splits the string `R` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to `Q`. The other variables (`n`, `d`, `xi`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace.**
