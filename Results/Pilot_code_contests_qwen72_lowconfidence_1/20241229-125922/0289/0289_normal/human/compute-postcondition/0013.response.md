To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it operates. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V`
- `B` is an empty list

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(l):
    B.append(int(V[i]))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `l` times, where `l` is the number of substrings in `V`.
2. **Loop Body**: For each iteration `i` (from 0 to `l-1`), the loop appends the integer value of `V[i]` to the list `B`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- If `l` is 0 (i.e., `V` is an empty list), the loop does not execute, and `B` remains an empty list.
- If `l` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `l` times, and `B` will contain the integer values of all elements in `V`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100
- `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100
- `R` is a string input by the user
- `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace
- `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`
- `W` is a string input by the user
- `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace
- `l` is the number of substrings in `V`
- `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V` (if `l` > 0, otherwise `B` is an empty list)

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V`, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V` if `l` > 0, otherwise `B` is an empty list**
