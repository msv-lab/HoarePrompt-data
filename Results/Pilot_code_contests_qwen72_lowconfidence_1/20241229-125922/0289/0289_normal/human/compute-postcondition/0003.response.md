The code snippet assigns the user's input (a string) to the variable `W`. The other variables (`n`, `d`, `xi`, `R`, `Q`, `g`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user**
