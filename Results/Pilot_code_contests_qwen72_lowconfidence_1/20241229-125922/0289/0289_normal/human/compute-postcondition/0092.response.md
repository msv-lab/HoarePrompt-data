Functionality: ** The function reads two lines of input from the user. The first line is expected to contain two integers separated by whitespace, where the second integer (`g`) is used as a threshold. The second line contains a space-separated list of integers which are converted to a list of integers (`B`). It then sorts the list (`A`) and determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `A` to ensure that the difference between any two remaining elements is greater than `g`. The function prints this minimum number of elements to be removed. If the list `B` is empty, the function prints `0`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. After execution, the program state includes the sorted list `A`, the minimum number of elements to remove (`count`), and lists of elements that are below and above the remaining valid subarray (`rm_elem_lower` and `rm_elem_upper`). **
