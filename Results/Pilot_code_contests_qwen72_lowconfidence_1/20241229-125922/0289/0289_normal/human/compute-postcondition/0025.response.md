The `break` statement causes an immediate exit from the innermost loop or if statement. However, since there is no loop or conditional structure specified in the provided context, the `break` statement would not cause a change in the state of the variables. The state remains as it was before the `break` statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `count` is equal to `l`, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if it exists.
