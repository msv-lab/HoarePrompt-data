The code `B.append(int(V[i]))` appends the integer value of `V[2]` to the list `B`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the third element of `V` (since list indexing starts at 0) is converted to an integer and added to `B`.

Given the initial state:
- `B` is initially a list containing the integer value of `V[0]` and the integer value of `V[1]`.
- `i` is 2.

After executing the code, `B` now contains three elements: the integer value of `V[0]`, the integer value of `V[1]`, and the integer value of `V[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a non-empty string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace and must have at least two substrings, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 2, `B` is a list containing the integer value of `V[0]`, the integer value of `V[1]`, and the integer value of `V[2]`, `i` is 2**.
