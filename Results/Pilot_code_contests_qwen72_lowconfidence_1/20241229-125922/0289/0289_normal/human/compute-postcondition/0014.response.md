`A` is assigned the value of `sorted(B)`. This means `A` will contain the elements of `B` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V`, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V` if `l` > 0, otherwise `B` is an empty list, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order**
