The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently within. Since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned in the context, we assume this `break` is part of such a structure. The variables and their values remain unchanged except for the fact that the `break` statement would cause the program flow to exit the current loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list, `count` is updated to `l - k`, `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`, `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
