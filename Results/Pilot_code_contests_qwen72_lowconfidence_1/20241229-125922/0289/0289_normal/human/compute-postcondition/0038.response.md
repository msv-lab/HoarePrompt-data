Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `d` is an integer where 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, `xi` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100, `R` is a string input by the user, `Q` is a list of substrings from `R` split by whitespace, `g` is the integer value of `Q[1]`, `W` is a string input by the user, `V` is a list of substrings from `W` split by whitespace, `l` is the number of substrings in `V` and must be greater than 0, `B` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `V`, `A` is a list of elements from `B` in ascending order, `k` is the smallest index such that `A[k] - A[i] > g` or `k` is equal to `l` if no such index exists, `i` is 0. `k` is equal to `l`. If `l - k + i < count`, then `count` is updated to `l - k`, `rm_elem_lower` is an empty list, `rm_elem_upper` is `A[k:]`, and `rm_elem_total` is `A[k:]`.***
