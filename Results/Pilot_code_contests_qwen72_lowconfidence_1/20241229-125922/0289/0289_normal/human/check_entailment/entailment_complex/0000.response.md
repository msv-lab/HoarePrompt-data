Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads two lines of input. The first line contains two integers `n` and `d`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers representing the coordinates of the points.
   - These inputs are parsed correctly into the variables `g` (the maximum allowed diameter) and `B` (the list of coordinates).

2. **Sorting the Coordinates:**
   - The list of coordinates `B` is sorted into `A`. Sorting is necessary to efficiently find the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter does not exceed `d`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Points to Remove:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of points to remove.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `A` and maintains a window of points where the difference between the maximum and minimum points in the window does not exceed `g`.
   - The variable `k` is used to track the end of the current window, and `i` is the start of the window.
   - For each starting point `i`, the program expands the window by incrementing `k` until the difference between `A[k]` and `A[i]` exceeds `g`.
   - The program keeps track of the minimum number of points to remove (`count`) and updates it whenever a smaller number of points can be removed to achieve the desired diameter.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of points to remove, which is stored in the variable `count`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input List:**
  - The problem description guarantees that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, so the list of points will never be empty. Therefore, the program does not need to handle an empty list case.
- **Single Point:**
  - If there is only one point, the diameter is 0, and no points need to be removed. The program handles this correctly because the initial value of `count` is set to `l` (the length of the list), and the loop will not change `count` if the list has only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
