You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.

The diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset {1, 3, 2, 1} is 2.

Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.

You are given n points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed d?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 100) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the points.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.

Examples

Input

3 1
2 1 4


Output

1


Input

3 0
7 7 7


Output

0


Input

6 3
1 3 4 6 9 10


Output

3

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate 4. The remaining points will have coordinates 1 and 2, so the diameter will be equal to 2 - 1 = 1.

In the second test case the diameter is equal to 0, so its is unnecessary to remove any points. 

In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates 1, 9 and 10. The remaining points will have coordinates 3, 4 and 6, so the diameter will be equal to 6 - 3 = 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    R = raw_input()
    Q = R.split()
    g = int(Q[1])
    W = raw_input()
    V = W.split()
    l = len(V)
    B = []
    for i in range(l):
        B.append(int(V[i]))
    A = sorted(B)
    count = l
    k = 0
    for i in range(l):
        while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
            k += 1
            if k == l:
                break
        if l - k + i < count:
            count = l - k + i
            rm_elem_lower = A[:i]
            rm_elem_upper = A[k:]
            rm_elem_total = rm_elem_lower + rm_elem_upper
        if k == l:
            break
    print(count)


```
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input from the user. The first line is expected to contain two integers separated by whitespace, where the second integer (`g`) is used as a threshold. The second line contains a space-separated list of integers which are converted to a list of integers (`B`). It then sorts the list (`A`) and determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `A` to ensure that the difference between any two remaining elements is greater than `g`. The function prints this minimum number of elements to be removed. If the list `B` is empty, the function prints `0`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. After execution, the program state includes the sorted list `A`, the minimum number of elements to remove (`count`), and lists of elements that are below and above the remaining valid subarray (`rm_elem_lower` and `rm_elem_upper`).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
