Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. It reads the input, processes the points to find the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter does not exceed `d`, and outputs the correct result. The logic used in the program is consistent with the problem's requirements, and it handles edge cases such as when the diameter is already within the limit or when all points need to be removed. No counterexample where the program fails has been identified.
