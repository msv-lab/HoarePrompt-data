You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.

The diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset {1, 3, 2, 1} is 2.

Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.

You are given n points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed d?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 100) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the points.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.

Examples

Input

3 1
2 1 4


Output

1


Input

3 0
7 7 7


Output

0


Input

6 3
1 3 4 6 9 10


Output

3

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate 4. The remaining points will have coordinates 1 and 2, so the diameter will be equal to 2 - 1 = 1.

In the second test case the diameter is equal to 0, so its is unnecessary to remove any points. 

In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates 1, 9 and 10. The remaining points will have coordinates 3, 4 and 6, so the diameter will be equal to 6 - 3 = 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    R = raw_input()
    Q = R.split()
    g = int(Q[1])
    W = raw_input()
    V = W.split()
    l = len(V)
    B = []
    for i in range(l):
        B.append(int(V[i]))
    A = sorted(B)
    count = l
    k = 0
    for i in range(l):
        while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
            k += 1
            if k == l:
                break
        if l - k + i < count:
            count = l - k + i
            rm_elem_lower = A[:i]
            rm_elem_upper = A[k:]
            rm_elem_total = rm_elem_lower + rm_elem_upper
        if k == l:
            break
    print(count)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
