You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: We've got no test cases. A big olympiad is coming up. But the problemsetters' number one priority should be adding another problem to the round.

The diameter of a multiset of points on the line is the largest distance between two points from this set. For example, the diameter of the multiset {1, 3, 2, 1} is 2.

Diameter of multiset consisting of one point is 0.

You are given n points on the line. What is the minimum number of points you have to remove, so that the diameter of the multiset of the remaining points will not exceed d?

Input

The first line contains two integers n and d (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 100) — the amount of points and the maximum allowed diameter respectively.

The second line contains n space separated integers (1 ≤ xi ≤ 100) — the coordinates of the points.

Output

Output a single integer — the minimum number of points you have to remove.

Examples

Input

3 1
2 1 4


Output

1


Input

3 0
7 7 7


Output

0


Input

6 3
1 3 4 6 9 10


Output

3

Note

In the first test case the optimal strategy is to remove the point with coordinate 4. The remaining points will have coordinates 1 and 2, so the diameter will be equal to 2 - 1 = 1.

In the second test case the diameter is equal to 0, so its is unnecessary to remove any points. 

In the third test case the optimal strategy is to remove points with coordinates 1, 9 and 10. The remaining points will have coordinates 3, 4 and 6, so the diameter will be equal to 6 - 3 = 3.
Program:
```
def func():
    R = raw_input()
    Q = R.split()
    g = int(Q[1])
    W = raw_input()
    V = W.split()
    l = len(V)
    B = []
    for i in range(l):
        B.append(int(V[i]))
    A = sorted(B)
    count = l
    k = 0
    for i in range(l):
        while A[k] - A[i] <= g:
            k += 1
            if k == l:
                break
        if l - k + i < count:
            count = l - k + i
            rm_elem_lower = A[:i]
            rm_elem_upper = A[k:]
            rm_elem_total = rm_elem_lower + rm_elem_upper
        if k == l:
            break
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program appears to handle the problem description correctly for all potential cases. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values for `n` and `d` and the list of points. It converts these inputs into the appropriate data types and stores them in variables.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of points. This is crucial because the diameter of a sorted list can be determined by the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

3. **Sliding Window Approach**: The program uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum number of points to remove. It iterates through the sorted list and maintains a window where the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the window does not exceed `d`.

4. **Count Calculation**: The program calculates the number of points to remove by considering the points outside the current valid window. It updates the minimum count of points to remove as it finds smaller windows that meet the diameter constraint.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `d` is 0, the program correctly handles the case where all points are the same (as shown in the second example).
   - When `d` is large enough to cover all points, the program correctly outputs 0 (as shown in the first example).

The program appears to handle all edge cases and general cases correctly, ensuring that the diameter of the remaining points does not exceed `d`. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input from the user. The first line is expected to contain two integers separated by whitespace, where the second integer (`g`) is used as a threshold. The second line contains a space-separated list of integers which are converted to a list of integers (`B`). It then sorts the list (`A`) and determines the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `A` to ensure that the difference between any two remaining elements is greater than `g`. The function prints this minimum number of elements to be removed. If the list `B` is empty, the function prints `0`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. After execution, the program state includes the sorted list `A`, the minimum number of elements to remove (`count`), and lists of elements that are below and above the remaining valid subarray (`rm_elem_lower` and `rm_elem_upper`).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
