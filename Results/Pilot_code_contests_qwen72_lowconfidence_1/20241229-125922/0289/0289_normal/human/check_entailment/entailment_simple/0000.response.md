Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads two lines of input. The first line is split into two parts: `n` and `d`.
   - The second line is split into individual points, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `B`.

2. **Sorting the Points:**
   - The list `B` is sorted to make it easier to find the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter of the remaining points does not exceed `d`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Points to Remove:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray of points where the difference between the maximum and minimum points in the subarray is less than or equal to `d`.
   - It initializes `count` to the total number of points (`l`).
   - It iterates through each point in the sorted list `A` and uses a while loop to find the farthest point in the subarray that still satisfies the diameter condition.
   - It updates `count` with the minimum number of points to remove to achieve the required diameter.
   - The variables `rm_elem_lower` and `rm_elem_upper` are used to keep track of the points that need to be removed, but they are not necessary for the output and can be ignored.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum number of points to remove, which is stored in `count`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases:
- If `d` is 0 and all points are the same, no points need to be removed.
- If `d` is large enough to include all points, no points need to be removed.
- If the points are spread out, it correctly calculates the minimum number of points to remove to ensure the diameter condition is met.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ d ≤ 100, 1 ≤ xi ≤ 100), the program efficiently finds the solution and always outputs the correct result according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
