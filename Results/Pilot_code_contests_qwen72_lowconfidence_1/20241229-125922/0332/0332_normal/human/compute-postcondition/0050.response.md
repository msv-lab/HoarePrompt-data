Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` from standard input, both of which are of equal length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and contain only lowercase English letters. The function then processes these strings to produce a new string based on the following rules:

1. If the length of the strings (`n`) is 1, the function prints the single character from `s`.
2. If the length of the strings is 2, the function prints the lexicographically smaller concatenation of the characters from `s` and `t`.
3. If the length of the strings is greater than 2:
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is less than or equal to the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `s` for even indices and `t` for odd indices). If the length of the strings is odd and the last character in the constructed string is greater than the second-to-last character, the last two characters are swapped.
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is greater than the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `t` for even indices and `s` for odd indices), and then reverses the resulting string before printing it.

After the function executes, the original strings `s` and `t` remain sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively, and the final state of the program includes the printed output string. The function does not return any value. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that the input strings are of equal length and contain only lowercase English letters, as specified in the problem statement.
- The function handles the case where the length of the strings is 1 or 2 correctly.
- For strings longer than 2 characters, the function ensures that the constructed string is either directly printed or adjusted (if necessary) before printing, depending on the comparison of the first characters of the sorted `s` and `t`.
- The function does not handle cases where the input strings are not of equal length or contain characters other than lowercase English letters, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
