The code snippet updates the values of `s` and `t` by sorting the strings read by the `rstr()` function. `s` is sorted in ascending order, and `t` is sorted in descending order. The lengths of `s` and `t` remain `n`, and they contain only lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `n` and containing only lowercase English letters.**
