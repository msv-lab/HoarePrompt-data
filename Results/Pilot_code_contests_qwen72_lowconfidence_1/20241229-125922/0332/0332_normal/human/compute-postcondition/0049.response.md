The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. Both `s` and `t` are strings of equal length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and they consist only of lowercase English letters. The function's output is not specified in the provided context, but based on typical programming tasks involving strings, it could involve operations such as checking if `s` and `t` are anagrams, comparing them, or transforming one into another. However, without specific output details, the functionality can only be described up to the point of input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `s` and `t`, both strings of equal length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) containing only lowercase English letters.**
