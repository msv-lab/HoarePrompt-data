The code snippet `print(''.join(ans[::-1]))` reverses the list `ans` and joins its elements into a single string, which is then printed. This operation does not alter the values of any variables; it only outputs a string.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order.
- `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order.
- Each list (`s` and `t`) is of length `le`, which is at least 3.
- `s[0] > t[0]`.
- `mds` is `-1`.
- `mdt` is `-1`.
- `ans` is a list of characters where characters from `s` and `t` are alternately appended, starting with a character from `s` if `le` is even or from `t` if `le` is odd, and the final list `ans` contains exactly `le` elements.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `ans` is reversed and joined into a string, which is then printed.
- The values of `s`, `t`, `le`, `mds`, `mdt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le` which is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `-1`, `mdt` is `-1`, `ans` is a list of characters where characters from `s` and `t` are alternately appended starting with a character from `s` if `le` is even or from `t` if `le` is odd, and the final list `ans` contains exactly `le` elements.**
