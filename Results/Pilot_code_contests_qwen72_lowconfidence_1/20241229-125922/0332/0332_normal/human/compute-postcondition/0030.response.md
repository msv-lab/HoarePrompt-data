`mds` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le`, `le` is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 1`, `ans` is `[s[int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2]]`, `i` is 0 and `i` is even**
