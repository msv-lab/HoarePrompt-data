The code `ans.append(t[mdt])` appends the element at index `mdt` from the list `t` to the list `ans`.

- `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order.
- `mdt` is defined as `(le // 2) - 1`.
- `ans` is initially an empty list.
- `i` is currently an odd number.

After appending `t[mdt]` to `ans`, the new state of `ans` is `[t[mdt]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le`, `le` is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 1`, `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1]]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is odd**.
