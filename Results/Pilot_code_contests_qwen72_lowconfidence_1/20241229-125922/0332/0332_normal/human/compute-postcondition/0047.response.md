Postcondition: ***`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `n`, and `le` is `n` which is not equal to 1. If `le` is 2, the value `s[0] + t[0]` is printed. Otherwise, if `le` is at least 3, and if `s[0] <= t[0]`, the concatenated string from `ans` is printed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `s[0] > t[0]`, the list `ans` is reversed and joined into a string, which is then printed, and the values of `s`, `t`, `le`, `mds`, `mdt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
