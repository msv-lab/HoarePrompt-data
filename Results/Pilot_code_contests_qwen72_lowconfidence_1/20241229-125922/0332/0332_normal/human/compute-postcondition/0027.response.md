The value of `mdt` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `mdt` was `(le // 2) - 1`, so the new value of `mdt` is `((le // 2) - 1) - 1` which simplifies to `(le // 2) - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le`, `le` is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 2`, `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1]]`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is odd**
