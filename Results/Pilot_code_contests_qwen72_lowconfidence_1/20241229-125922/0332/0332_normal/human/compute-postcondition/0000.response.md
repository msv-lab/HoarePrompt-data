The function `rstr` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the result. This function does not change the values of the variables `s` and `t`, nor does it affect the length `n` of the strings. However, it provides a way to read input strings.

Output State: **The input consists of two strings, `s` and `t`, each of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5), containing only lowercase English letters. `rstr` is a function that reads a line from standard input, strips it, and returns the result.**
