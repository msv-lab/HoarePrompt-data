The value of `mdt` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `mdt` was `(le // 2) - 2`, so the new value of `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le` which is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 3`, `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1], t[(le // 2) - 2]]`, and `i` is 1.**
