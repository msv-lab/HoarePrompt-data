The code snippet `ans.append(s[mds])` appends the element at index `mds` from the list `s` to the list `ans`.

- `s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order.
- `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order.
- `le` is the length of both `s` and `t`, and it is at least 3.
- `s[0] > t[0]` indicates that the first character in `s` is greater than the first character in `t`.
- `i` is 2.
- `mds` is calculated as `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`.
- `mdt` is calculated as `(le // 2) - 2`.
- `ans` initially contains `[t[(le // 2) - 1], s[int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1]]`.

The new element appended to `ans` is `s[mds]`. 

Therefore, the updated `ans` list is:
\[ \text{ans} = [t[(\text{le} // 2) - 1], s[\text{int(ceil(le / 2))} - 1], s[\text{int(ceil(le / 2))} - 2]] \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le` which is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `i` is 2, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 2`, and `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1], s[int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1], s[int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2]]`**
