The value of `ans` is updated by appending the element at index `mdt` from the list `t`. Given that `mdt` is defined as `(le // 2) - 2`, the new element appended to `ans` is `t[(le // 2) - 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le` which is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 2`, `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1], t[(le // 2) - 2]]`, and `i` is 1.
