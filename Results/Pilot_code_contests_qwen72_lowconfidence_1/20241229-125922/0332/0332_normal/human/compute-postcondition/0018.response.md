Postcondition: ***`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `n`, `le` is `n` and must be greater than 1, `le` is not equal to 1, `le` is not equal to 2, the first character of `s` is less than or equal to the first character of `t`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[2k] = s[k]` and `ans[2k+1] = t[k]` for `k` ranging from 0 to `(n-1)//2`. Additionally, `le` is odd, and the last element of `ans` is greater than the second-to-last element of `ans`.***
