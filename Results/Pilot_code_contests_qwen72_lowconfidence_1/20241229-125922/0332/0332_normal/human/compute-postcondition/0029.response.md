The code `ans.append(s[mds])` appends the element at the index `mds` of the list `s` to the list `ans`.

Given:
- `s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order.
- `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order.
- Each list has a length `le`.
- `le` is at least 3.
- `s[0] > t[0]`.
- `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`.
- `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 1`.
- `ans` is `[]`.
- `i` is 0 and `i` is even.

The value of `mds` is calculated as `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`. Since `le` is at least 3, `mds` will be the middle index (or one of the middle indices if `le` is even).

After executing `ans.append(s[mds])`, the list `ans` will contain the character at the index `mds` of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, each of length `le`, `le` is at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 1`, `ans` is `[s[mds]]`, `i` is 0 and `i` is even**.
