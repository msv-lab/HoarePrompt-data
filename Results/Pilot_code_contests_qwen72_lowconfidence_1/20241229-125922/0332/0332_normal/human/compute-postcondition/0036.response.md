The value of `mds` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1`. After decrementing, `mds` becomes `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a sorted list of characters from the first input string in ascending order, `t` is a sorted list of characters from the second input string in descending order, `le` is the length of both lists, at least 3, `s[0] > t[0]`, `mds` is `int(ceil(le / 2)) - 2`, `mdt` is `(le // 2) - 2`, `ans` is `[t[(le // 2) - 1], s[int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1]]`, `i` is 1**
