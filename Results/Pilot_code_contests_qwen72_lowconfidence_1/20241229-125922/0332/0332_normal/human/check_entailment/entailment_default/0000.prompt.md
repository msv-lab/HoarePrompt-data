You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Oleg the client and Igor the analyst are good friends. However, sometimes they argue over little things. Recently, they started a new company, but they are having trouble finding a name for the company.

To settle this problem, they've decided to play a game. The company name will consist of n letters. Oleg and Igor each have a set of n letters (which might contain multiple copies of the same letter, the sets can be different). Initially, the company name is denoted by n question marks. Oleg and Igor takes turns to play the game, Oleg moves first. In each turn, a player can choose one of the letters c in his set and replace any of the question marks with c. Then, a copy of the letter c is removed from his set. The game ends when all the question marks has been replaced by some letter.

For example, suppose Oleg has the set of letters {i, o, i} and Igor has the set of letters {i, m, o}. One possible game is as follows :

Initially, the company name is ???.

Oleg replaces the second question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes ?i?. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i, o}.

Igor replaces the third question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes ?io. The set of letters Igor have now is {i, m}.

Finally, Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes oio. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i}.

In the end, the company name is oio.

Oleg wants the company name to be as lexicographically small as possible while Igor wants the company name to be as lexicographically large as possible. What will be the company name if Oleg and Igor always play optimally?

A string s = s1s2...sm is called lexicographically smaller than a string t = t1t2...tm (where s ≠ t) if si < ti where i is the smallest index such that si ≠ ti. (so sj = tj for all j < i)

Input

The first line of input contains a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105). All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Oleg has initially.

The second line of input contains a string t of length n. All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Igor has initially.

Output

The output should contain a string of n lowercase English letters, denoting the company name if Oleg and Igor plays optimally.

Examples

Input

tinkoff
zscoder


Output

fzfsirk


Input

xxxxxx
xxxxxx


Output

xxxxxx


Input

ioi
imo


Output

ioi

Note

One way to play optimally in the first sample is as follows :

  * Initially, the company name is ???????.
  * Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes f??????.
  * Igor replaces the second question mark with 'z'. The company name becomes fz?????.
  * Oleg replaces the third question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes fzf????.
  * Igor replaces the fourth question mark with 's'. The company name becomes fzfs???.
  * Oleg replaces the fifth question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes fzfsi??.
  * Igor replaces the sixth question mark with 'r'. The company name becomes fzfsir?.
  * Oleg replaces the seventh question mark with 'k'. The company name becomes fzfsirk.



For the second sample, no matter how they play, the company name will always be xxxxxx.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin
from math import ceil

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    (s, t) = (sorted(rstr()), sorted(rstr(), reverse=True))
    le = len(s)
    if le == 1:
        print(s[0])
    elif le == 2:
        print(min(s[0] + t[0], t[0] + s[0]))
    elif s[0] <= t[0]:
        ans = []
        for i in range(le):
            ans.append(t[i >> 1] if i & 1 else s[i >> 1])
        if le & 1 and ans[-1] > ans[-2]:
            (ans[-1], ans[-2]) = (ans[-2], ans[-1])
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        (mds, mdt, ans) = (int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1, (le >> 1) - 1, [])
        for i in range(le):
            if i & 1:
                ans.append(t[mdt])
                mdt -= 1
            else:
                ans.append(s[mds])
                mds -= 1
        print(''.join(ans[::-1]))


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` from standard input, both of which are of equal length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and contain only lowercase English letters. The function then processes these strings to produce a new string based on the following rules:

1. If the length of the strings (`n`) is 1, the function prints the single character from `s`.
2. If the length of the strings is 2, the function prints the lexicographically smaller concatenation of the characters from `s` and `t`.
3. If the length of the strings is greater than 2:
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is less than or equal to the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `s` for even indices and `t` for odd indices). If the length of the strings is odd and the last character in the constructed string is greater than the second-to-last character, the last two characters are swapped.
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is greater than the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `t` for even indices and `s` for odd indices), and then reverses the resulting string before printing it.

After the function executes, the original strings `s` and `t` remain sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively, and the final state of the program includes the printed output string. The function does not return any value.

Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
