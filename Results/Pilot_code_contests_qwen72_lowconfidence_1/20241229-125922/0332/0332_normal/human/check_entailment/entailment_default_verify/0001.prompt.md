You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Oleg the client and Igor the analyst are good friends. However, sometimes they argue over little things. Recently, they started a new company, but they are having trouble finding a name for the company.

To settle this problem, they've decided to play a game. The company name will consist of n letters. Oleg and Igor each have a set of n letters (which might contain multiple copies of the same letter, the sets can be different). Initially, the company name is denoted by n question marks. Oleg and Igor takes turns to play the game, Oleg moves first. In each turn, a player can choose one of the letters c in his set and replace any of the question marks with c. Then, a copy of the letter c is removed from his set. The game ends when all the question marks has been replaced by some letter.

For example, suppose Oleg has the set of letters {i, o, i} and Igor has the set of letters {i, m, o}. One possible game is as follows :

Initially, the company name is ???.

Oleg replaces the second question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes ?i?. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i, o}.

Igor replaces the third question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes ?io. The set of letters Igor have now is {i, m}.

Finally, Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes oio. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i}.

In the end, the company name is oio.

Oleg wants the company name to be as lexicographically small as possible while Igor wants the company name to be as lexicographically large as possible. What will be the company name if Oleg and Igor always play optimally?

A string s = s1s2...sm is called lexicographically smaller than a string t = t1t2...tm (where s ≠ t) if si < ti where i is the smallest index such that si ≠ ti. (so sj = tj for all j < i)

Input

The first line of input contains a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105). All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Oleg has initially.

The second line of input contains a string t of length n. All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Igor has initially.

Output

The output should contain a string of n lowercase English letters, denoting the company name if Oleg and Igor plays optimally.

Examples

Input

tinkoff
zscoder


Output

fzfsirk


Input

xxxxxx
xxxxxx


Output

xxxxxx


Input

ioi
imo


Output

ioi

Note

One way to play optimally in the first sample is as follows :

  * Initially, the company name is ???????.
  * Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes f??????.
  * Igor replaces the second question mark with 'z'. The company name becomes fz?????.
  * Oleg replaces the third question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes fzf????.
  * Igor replaces the fourth question mark with 's'. The company name becomes fzfs???.
  * Oleg replaces the fifth question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes fzfsi??.
  * Igor replaces the sixth question mark with 'r'. The company name becomes fzfsir?.
  * Oleg replaces the seventh question mark with 'k'. The company name becomes fzfsirk.



For the second sample, no matter how they play, the company name will always be xxxxxx.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin
from math import ceil

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    (s, t) = (sorted(rstr()), sorted(rstr(), reverse=True))
    le = len(s)
    if le == 1:
        print(s[0])
    elif le == 2:
        print(min(s[0] + t[0], t[0] + s[0]))
    elif s[0] <= t[0]:
        ans = []
        for i in range(le):
            ans.append(t[i >> 1] if i & 1 else s[i >> 1])
        if le & 1 and ans[-1] > ans[-2]:
            (ans[-1], ans[-2]) = (ans[-2], ans[-1])
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        (mds, mdt, ans) = (int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1, (le >> 1) - 1, [])
        for i in range(le):
            if i & 1:
                ans.append(t[mdt])
                mdt -= 1
            else:
                ans.append(s[mds])
                mds -= 1
        print(''.join(ans[::-1]))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are greater than 2 and the first character of `s` is greater than the first character of `t`. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block is flawed. 

Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
abc
xyz
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aybxzc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
cybxa
```

The issue arises because the program incorrectly handles the placement of characters when the first character of `s` is greater than the first character of `t`. The logic in the `else` block does not ensure that the resulting string is lexicographically optimal as per the problem's requirements. The program should place characters in a way that Oleg minimizes the lexicographical order and Igor maximizes it, but the current implementation fails to do so correctly in this case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` from standard input, both of which are of equal length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and contain only lowercase English letters. The function then processes these strings to produce a new string based on the following rules:

1. If the length of the strings (`n`) is 1, the function prints the single character from `s`.
2. If the length of the strings is 2, the function prints the lexicographically smaller concatenation of the characters from `s` and `t`.
3. If the length of the strings is greater than 2:
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is less than or equal to the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `s` for even indices and `t` for odd indices). If the length of the strings is odd and the last character in the constructed string is greater than the second-to-last character, the last two characters are swapped.
   - If the first character of the sorted `s` is greater than the first character of the sorted `t`, the function constructs a new string by alternating characters from `s` and `t` (starting with `t` for even indices and `s` for odd indices), and then reverses the resulting string before printing it.

After the function executes, the original strings `s` and `t` remain sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively, and the final state of the program includes the printed output string. The function does not return any value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
