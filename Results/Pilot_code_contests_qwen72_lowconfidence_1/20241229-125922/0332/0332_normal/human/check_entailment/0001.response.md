Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are greater than 2 and the first character of `s` is greater than the first character of `t`. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block is flawed. 

Here's a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
abc
xyz
```

**Expected Output:**
```
aybxzc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
cybxa
```

The issue arises because the program incorrectly handles the placement of characters when the first character of `s` is greater than the first character of `t`. The logic in the `else` block does not ensure that the resulting string is lexicographically optimal as per the problem's requirements. The program should place characters in a way that Oleg minimizes the lexicographical order and Igor maximizes it, but the current implementation fails to do so correctly in this case.
