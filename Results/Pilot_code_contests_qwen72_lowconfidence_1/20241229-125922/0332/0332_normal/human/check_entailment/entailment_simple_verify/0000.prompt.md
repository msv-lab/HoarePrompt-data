You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Oleg the client and Igor the analyst are good friends. However, sometimes they argue over little things. Recently, they started a new company, but they are having trouble finding a name for the company.

To settle this problem, they've decided to play a game. The company name will consist of n letters. Oleg and Igor each have a set of n letters (which might contain multiple copies of the same letter, the sets can be different). Initially, the company name is denoted by n question marks. Oleg and Igor takes turns to play the game, Oleg moves first. In each turn, a player can choose one of the letters c in his set and replace any of the question marks with c. Then, a copy of the letter c is removed from his set. The game ends when all the question marks has been replaced by some letter.

For example, suppose Oleg has the set of letters {i, o, i} and Igor has the set of letters {i, m, o}. One possible game is as follows :

Initially, the company name is ???.

Oleg replaces the second question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes ?i?. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i, o}.

Igor replaces the third question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes ?io. The set of letters Igor have now is {i, m}.

Finally, Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'o'. The company name becomes oio. The set of letters Oleg have now is {i}.

In the end, the company name is oio.

Oleg wants the company name to be as lexicographically small as possible while Igor wants the company name to be as lexicographically large as possible. What will be the company name if Oleg and Igor always play optimally?

A string s = s1s2...sm is called lexicographically smaller than a string t = t1t2...tm (where s ≠ t) if si < ti where i is the smallest index such that si ≠ ti. (so sj = tj for all j < i)

Input

The first line of input contains a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·105). All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Oleg has initially.

The second line of input contains a string t of length n. All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Igor has initially.

Output

The output should contain a string of n lowercase English letters, denoting the company name if Oleg and Igor plays optimally.

Examples

Input

tinkoff
zscoder


Output

fzfsirk


Input

xxxxxx
xxxxxx


Output

xxxxxx


Input

ioi
imo


Output

ioi

Note

One way to play optimally in the first sample is as follows :

  * Initially, the company name is ???????.
  * Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes f??????.
  * Igor replaces the second question mark with 'z'. The company name becomes fz?????.
  * Oleg replaces the third question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes fzf????.
  * Igor replaces the fourth question mark with 's'. The company name becomes fzfs???.
  * Oleg replaces the fifth question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes fzfsi??.
  * Igor replaces the sixth question mark with 'r'. The company name becomes fzfsir?.
  * Oleg replaces the seventh question mark with 'k'. The company name becomes fzfsirk.



For the second sample, no matter how they play, the company name will always be xxxxxx.
Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin
from math import ceil

def func():
    rstr = lambda : stdin.readline().strip()
    (s, t) = (sorted(rstr()), sorted(rstr(), reverse=True))
    le = len(s)
    if le == 1:
        print(s[0])
    elif le == 2:
        print(min(s[0] + t[0], t[0] + s[0]))
    elif s[0] <= t[0]:
        ans = []
        for i in range(le):
            ans.append(t[i >> 1] if i & 1 else s[i >> 1])
        if le & 1 and ans[-1] > ans[-2]:
            (ans[-1], ans[-2]) = (ans[-2], ans[-1])
        print(''.join(ans))
    else:
        (mds, mdt, ans) = (int(ceil(le / 2)) - 1, (le >> 1) - 1, [])
        for i in range(le):
            if i & 1:
                ans.append(t[mdt])
                mdt -= 1
            else:
                ans.append(s[mds])
                mds -= 1
        print(''.join(ans[::-1]))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program reads two strings `s` and `t`, representing the sets of letters Oleg and Igor have, respectively. These strings are sorted in ascending order for `s` and descending order for `t`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the length of the strings is 1, the program correctly prints the only letter available.
   - If the length is 2, it correctly handles the lexicographical comparison between the two possible strings and prints the optimal result.

3. **General Case**:
   - For lengths greater than 2, the program constructs the final company name by alternating between the smallest available letter from Oleg's set and the largest available letter from Igor's set.
   - It uses bitwise operations to manage the indices efficiently.
   - The program also includes a special check to ensure that the last two characters are in the correct order if the length of the string is odd.

4. **Optimality**:
   - Oleg's strategy is to place the smallest available letter at each step, ensuring the result is as lexicographically small as possible.
   - Igor's strategy is to place the largest available letter at each step, ensuring the result is as lexicographically large as possible.
   - The program correctly alternates between these strategies, ensuring both players play optimally.

Given the thorough handling of edge cases and the general strategy, the program appears to be correct for all potential inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
