The code snippet `[n, k, d] = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())` reads input from the user, splits the input into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `k`, and `d` respectively.

Given the initial state where `n`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, the code will update the values of `n`, `k`, and `d` based on the input provided.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the integer values provided by the user, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.**
