Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values, `j` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `n - i < k` is true, which implies that `k` is greater than 1 (since `i` is `n - 1`). If `i + k < n` and `cando[i + k]` is `True`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
