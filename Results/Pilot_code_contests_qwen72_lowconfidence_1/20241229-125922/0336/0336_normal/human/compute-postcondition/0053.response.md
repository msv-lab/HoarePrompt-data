To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
```

### Current State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True`
- `j` is greater than 0 and `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d`
- If `cando[j]` is `True`, `count` is decreased by 1

### Condition Analysis:
The loop condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` must be true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d` (given)

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` must still hold true.
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, the condition simplifies to `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d` is already satisfied as per the given state.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the values of `i`, `ais`, or `d` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d` is already true and no changes are required to the current state for the loop to execute one more time, the state remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True`, `j` is greater than 0 and `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d`. If `cando[j]` is `True`, `count` is decreased by 1.**
