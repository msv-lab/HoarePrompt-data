To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

```python
while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
   - `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` (for `i = n - 3`).
   - `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] ≤ ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists.
   - If `ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d`, `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `j` is determined based on the condition `ais[j - 1] ≤ ais[i] + d`.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `ais[j - 1]` must be greater than `ais[i] + d`.
   - Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we need to ensure that there exists a `j` such that `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d`.

5. **Possible Adjustments:**
   - Ensure that `ais` is such that there exists an index `j` where `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d`.
   - Since `ais` is sorted in ascending order, `ais[j - 1]` must be greater than `ais[i] + d`.

### Conclusion:
Given the current state, the loop will execute if there exists a `j` such that `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, we need to ensure that the elements in `ais` are such that this condition holds.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` (for `i = n - 3`), `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` and `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` must hold for the loop to execute.**
