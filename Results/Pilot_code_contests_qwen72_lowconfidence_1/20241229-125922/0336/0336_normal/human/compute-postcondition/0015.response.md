The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end prematurely, skipping any remaining code within that iteration and moving on to the next iteration of the loop. Since no actual computation or assignment is performed, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values, `j` is `n - 1`, `n - i < k` is true, and `count` is 0.**
