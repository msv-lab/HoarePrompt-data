Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values, `j` is `n - 1`. If `ais[-1] - ais[i]` is less than or equal to `d`, the value at index `i` in `cando` is set to `True`. If `n - i < k`, then `count` remains 0.***
