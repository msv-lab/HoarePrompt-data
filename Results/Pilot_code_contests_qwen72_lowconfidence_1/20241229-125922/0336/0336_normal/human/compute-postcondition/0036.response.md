To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in reverse order, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
   - `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` if `count > 0` and `False` otherwise.
   - `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1]` ≤ `ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists.
   - `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse order, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be greater than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `d`, `a`, `ais`, `cando`, `j`, `count`) remain unchanged, but `cando[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` if `count > 0` and `False` otherwise, `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1]` ≤ `ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists, `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution.**
