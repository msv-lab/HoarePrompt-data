The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values. If `cando[j+1]` is `True`, then `cando[n-2]` is `True`, and `count` is `count - 1`. Otherwise, `cando` remains a list of `n` `False` values, and `count` is unchanged, `j` is `j - 1`.**
