Functionality: ** The function `func()` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `d`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a`. It then checks if there exists a subsequence of length `k` in the list `a` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subsequence is less than or equal to `d`. If such a subsequence exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by immediately printing 'YES' and exiting. The function also ensures that the input constraints are respected: `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5`, `0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9`. The function does not handle invalid input formats or out-of-bound values gracefully; it assumes that the input is always valid. **
