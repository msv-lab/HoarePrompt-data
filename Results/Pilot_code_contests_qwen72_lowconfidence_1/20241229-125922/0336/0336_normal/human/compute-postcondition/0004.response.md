The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. No further execution occurs after this point. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but the program execution stops.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the integer values provided by the user, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is 1, and the program has terminated.**
