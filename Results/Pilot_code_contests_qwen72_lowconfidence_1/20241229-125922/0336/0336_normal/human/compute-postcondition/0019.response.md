The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of the variables directly. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list where all values are `False` except for the value at index `i` which is `True`, `j` is `n - 1`, if `n - i < k`, then `count` remains 0, the difference between the last element of `ais` and the element at index `i` in `ais` is less than or equal to `d`.**
