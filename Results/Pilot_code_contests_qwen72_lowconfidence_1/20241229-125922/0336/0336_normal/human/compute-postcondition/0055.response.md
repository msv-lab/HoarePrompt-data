Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True`, `j` is greater than 0 and `ais[j - 1] > ais[n - 2] + d`. If `cando[j]` is `True`, `count` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `d`, `a`, `ais`, `cando`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
