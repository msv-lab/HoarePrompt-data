The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end prematurely and moves the control back to the beginning of the loop, effectively skipping any code that would normally follow the `continue` statement in the loop's body. This does not alter the values of the variables but affects the flow of the loop.

Given the initial conditions and the `continue` statement, the variables retain their values, but the loop proceeds to the next iteration. Here’s the updated state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is now `True`
- `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1]` ≤ `ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists
- If `n - i < k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifying any variables
- If `n - i ≥ k`, and `i + k < n` and `cando[i + k]` is `True`, then `count` is the initial value of `count` plus 1 minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution, otherwise, `count` remains unchanged from its initial value minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution
- The loop continues to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is now `True`, `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1]` ≤ `ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists, if `n - i < k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifying any variables, if `n - i ≥ k`, and `i + k < n` and `cando[i + k]` is `True`, then `count` is the initial value of `count` plus 1 minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution, otherwise, `count` remains unchanged from its initial value minus the number of `True` values in `cando` that were encountered during the loop execution, the loop continues to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.**
