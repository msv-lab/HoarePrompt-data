The code reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and maps each part to an integer, creating a list called `ais`. This list is expected to contain `n` integers.

- `ais` is now a list of `n` integers.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `d`, and the elements in `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the integer values provided by the user, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers.**
