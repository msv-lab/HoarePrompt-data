Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` (for `i = n - 3`), `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] ≤ ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists. If `ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d`, `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando`, and the next iteration of the loop starts.***
