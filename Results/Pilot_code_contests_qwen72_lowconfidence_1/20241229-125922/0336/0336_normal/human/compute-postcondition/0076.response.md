To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
```

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` must still be true after the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
- `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order
- `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` (for `i = n - 3`)
- `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 2] > ais[i] + d` minus 1, if `cando[j]` is `True`, `count` is `count - 2`. Otherwise, `count` is `count - 1`

Let's break down the condition:
- `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` must be true for the loop to continue.

From the given state:
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 2] > ais[i] + d` minus 1

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `ais[j - 1]` is still greater than `ais[i] + d`.

### Analysis:
1. **`ais[j - 1]`**: This value is derived from the sorted list `ais` and is dependent on the current value of `j`.
2. **`ais[i]`**: This value is fixed as `ais[n - 3]` since `i` is `n - 3`.
3. **`d`**: This value is fixed as given in the state.

The key here is to ensure that `j` is still valid and that the condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d` holds true. Since `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 2] > ais[i] + d` minus 1, `j` must be adjusted if the loop has modified `j` in the previous iteration.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: Ensure that `j` is still the largest index such that `ais[j - 2] > ais[i] + d` minus 1. If `j` was modified in the loop body, it should be recalculated to satisfy the condition.
- **No other states need to be adjusted** because they do not directly affect the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure it still satisfies the condition `ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` (for `i = n - 3`), `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 2] > ais[i] + d` minus 1, if `cando[j]` is `True`, `count` is `count - 2`. Otherwise, `count` is `count - 1`.**
