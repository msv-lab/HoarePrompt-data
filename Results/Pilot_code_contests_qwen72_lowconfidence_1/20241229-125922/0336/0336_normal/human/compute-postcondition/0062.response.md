The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. This means that the values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is altered.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` if `count > 0` and `False` otherwise, `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] ≤ ais[i] + d` or `j` is 0 if no such index exists. If `i + k < n` and `cando[i + k]` is `True`, then `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` is the initial value of `count` minus the number of `True` values in `cando`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
