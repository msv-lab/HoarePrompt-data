The code snippet `cando[i] = True` updates the value at index `i` of the list `cando` from `False` to `True`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
- `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
- `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- If `n - i < k`, then `count` remains 0.
- The difference between the last element of `ais` and the element at index `i` in `ais` is less than or equal to `d`.

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
- `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order.
- `cando` is a list where all values are `False` except for the value at index `i` which is `True`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- If `n - i < k`, then `count` remains 0.
- The difference between the last element of `ais` and the element at index `i` in `ais` is less than or equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list where all values are `False` except for the value at index `i` which is `True`, `j` is `n - 1`, if `n - i < k`, then `count` remains 0, the difference between the last element of `ais` and the element at index `i` in `ais` is less than or equal to `d`.**
