Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` `False` values. If `cando[j]` is `True`, then `cando[n-2]` is `True`, and `count` is `count - 1`. Otherwise, `cando` remains a list of `n` `False` values, and `count` is unchanged.***
