You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a1, a2, ..., an of n integer numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:

  * Each pencil belongs to exactly one box; 
  * Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it; 
  * If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |ai - aj| ≤ d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |ai - aj| ≤ d and they belong to different boxes. 



Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print "YES" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print "NO".

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and d (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — saturation of color of each pencil.

Output

Print "YES" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise print "NO".

Examples

Input

6 3 10
7 2 7 7 4 2


Output

YES


Input

6 2 3
4 5 3 13 4 10


Output

YES


Input

3 2 5
10 16 22


Output

NO

Note

In the first example it is possible to distribute pencils into 2 boxes with 3 pencils in each with any distribution. And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.

In the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.
Program:
```
from bisect import bisect
from sys import exit

def func():
    [n, k, d] = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    ais = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split()))
    if k == 1:
        print('YES')
        exit()
    ais.sort()
    cando = [False for _ in range(n)]
    j = n - 1
    count = 0
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if i + k < n and cando[i + k]:
            count += 1
        if n - i < k:
            continue
        if ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d:
            cando[i] = True
            continue
        while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
            if cando[j]:
                count -= 1
            j -= 1
        cando[i] = count > 0
    if cando[0]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the condition where the number of pencils is less than `k` but still satisfies the `|ai - aj| ≤ d` condition. The program does not correctly handle this edge case.

Consider the following input:
```
Input:
2 3 10
1 2
```
Expected Output:
```
NO
```
Actual Output:
The program will incorrectly output "YES" because it does not properly handle the case where `n < k`.

This input violates the condition that each non-empty box must have at least `k` pencils, but the program does not correctly detect this and outputs "YES" instead of "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
