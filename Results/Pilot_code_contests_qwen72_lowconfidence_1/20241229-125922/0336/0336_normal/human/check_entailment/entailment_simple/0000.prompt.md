You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a1, a2, ..., an of n integer numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:

  * Each pencil belongs to exactly one box; 
  * Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it; 
  * If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |ai - aj| ≤ d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |ai - aj| ≤ d and they belong to different boxes. 



Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print "YES" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print "NO".

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and d (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — saturation of color of each pencil.

Output

Print "YES" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise print "NO".

Examples

Input

6 3 10
7 2 7 7 4 2


Output

YES


Input

6 2 3
4 5 3 13 4 10


Output

YES


Input

3 2 5
10 16 22


Output

NO

Note

In the first example it is possible to distribute pencils into 2 boxes with 3 pencils in each with any distribution. And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.

In the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from bisect import bisect
from sys import exit

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5 and 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    [n, k, d] = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    ais = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split()))
    if (k == 1) :
        print('YES')
        exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n`, `k`, and `d` are updated to the integer values provided by the user, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers. If `k` is 1, the program has terminated.
    ais.sort()
    cando = [(False) for _ in range(n)]
    j = n - 1
    count = 0
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if i + k < n and cando[i + k]:
            count += 1
        
        if n - i < k:
            continue
        
        if ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d:
            cando[i] = True
            continue
        
        while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
            if cando[j]:
                count -= 1
            j -= 1
        
        cando[i] = count > 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` if there exists a valid subsequence of length `k` starting at `i` that satisfies the condition `ais[j] - ais[i] <= d` for all elements in the subsequence, and `False` otherwise, `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] <= ais[0] + d` or 0 if no such index exists, `count` is the final value of `count` based on the number of valid subsequences found during the loop execution.
    if cando[0] :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `ais` is a list of `n` integers sorted in ascending order, `cando` is a list of `n` values where `cando[i]` is `True` if there exists a valid subsequence of length `k` starting at `i` that satisfies the condition `ais[j] - ais[i] <= d` for all elements in the subsequence, and `False` otherwise, `j` is the largest index such that `ais[j - 1] <= ais[0] + d` or 0 if no such index exists, and `count` is the final value of `count` based on the number of valid subsequences found during the loop execution. If `cando[0]` is `True`, then `cando[0]` remains `True`. If `cando[0]` is `False`, then `cando[0]` remains `False`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
