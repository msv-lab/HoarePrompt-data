You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka received a gift of multicolored pencils for his birthday! Unfortunately he lives in a monochrome world, where everything is of the same color and only saturation differs. This pack can be represented as a sequence a1, a2, ..., an of n integer numbers — saturation of the color of each pencil. Now Mishka wants to put all the mess in the pack in order. He has an infinite number of empty boxes to do this. He would like to fill some boxes in such a way that:

  * Each pencil belongs to exactly one box; 
  * Each non-empty box has at least k pencils in it; 
  * If pencils i and j belong to the same box, then |ai - aj| ≤ d, where |x| means absolute value of x. Note that the opposite is optional, there can be pencils i and j such that |ai - aj| ≤ d and they belong to different boxes. 



Help Mishka to determine if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes. Print "YES" if there exists such a distribution. Otherwise print "NO".

Input

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and d (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·105, 0 ≤ d ≤ 109) — the number of pencils, minimal size of any non-empty box and maximal difference in saturation between any pair of pencils in the same box, respectively.

The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — saturation of color of each pencil.

Output

Print "YES" if it's possible to distribute all the pencils into boxes and satisfy all the conditions. Otherwise print "NO".

Examples

Input

6 3 10
7 2 7 7 4 2


Output

YES


Input

6 2 3
4 5 3 13 4 10


Output

YES


Input

3 2 5
10 16 22


Output

NO

Note

In the first example it is possible to distribute pencils into 2 boxes with 3 pencils in each with any distribution. And you also can put all the pencils into the same box, difference of any pair in it won't exceed 10.

In the second example you can split pencils of saturations [4, 5, 3, 4] into 2 boxes of size 2 and put the remaining ones into another box.
Program:
```
from bisect import bisect
from sys import exit

def func():
    [n, k, d] = map(int, raw_input().strip().split())
    ais = list(map(int, raw_input().strip().split()))
    if k == 1:
        print('YES')
        exit()
    ais.sort()
    cando = [False for _ in range(n)]
    j = n - 1
    count = 0
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if i + k < n and cando[i + k]:
            count += 1
        if n - i < k:
            continue
        if ais[-1] - ais[i] <= d:
            cando[i] = True
            continue
        while ais[j - 1] > ais[i] + d:
            if cando[j]:
                count -= 1
            j -= 1
        cando[i] = count > 0
    if cando[0]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
Input:
6 3 5
1 2 3 9 10 11
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation of the Issue:
- The input consists of 6 pencils with saturations `[1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]`, and the conditions are that each box must contain at least 3 pencils (`k = 3`) and the maximum difference in saturation within a box is 5 (`d = 5`).
- The correct solution should be "YES" because the pencils can be grouped into two boxes: `[1, 2, 3]` and `[9, 10, 11]`. Both boxes meet the conditions: each box has at least 3 pencils, and the maximum difference in saturation within each box is 2 and 2, respectively, which is less than or equal to 5.
- However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it fails to correctly identify the valid grouping of pencils.

This indicates that the program does not handle the case where the pencils can be divided into multiple valid boxes correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func()` reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `d`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `a`. It then checks if there exists a subsequence of length `k` in the list `a` such that the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subsequence is less than or equal to `d`. If such a subsequence exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by immediately printing 'YES' and exiting. The function also ensures that the input constraints are respected: `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5`, `0 ≤ d ≤ 10^9`, and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9`. The function does not handle invalid input formats or out-of-bound values gracefully; it assumes that the input is always valid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
