The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains four distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function then performs the following checks and actions:

1. If `n` is 4, the function prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is less than `n + 1`, the function also prints `-1`.
3. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the function constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and finally appends `b` and `d` to the list. It then creates two permutations of `chain`:
   - `p1`: The last two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   - `p2`: The first two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   The function prints both `p1` and `p2` as space-separated strings.

After the function executes, the final state of the program is:
- If `n` is 4 or `k` is less than `n + 1`, `-1` is printed to the console.
- If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, two lines of space-separated integers representing the permutations `p1` and `p2` are printed to the console.
