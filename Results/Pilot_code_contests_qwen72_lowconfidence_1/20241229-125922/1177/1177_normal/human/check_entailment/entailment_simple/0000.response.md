Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly addresses the problem statement as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Validation**:
   - The program reads the input values `n` and `k` from the standard input.
   - It also reads the four distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Handling Special Case for \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The program checks if \( n = 4 \). If so, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to form two distinct Hamiltonian paths between the given pairs of cities with only 4 cities and the constraints on the number of roads.

3. **Checking Road Constraints**:
   - The program checks if \( k \geq n + 1 \). This is necessary because forming two Hamiltonian paths between the given pairs of cities requires at least \( n + 1 \) roads (one path of \( n - 1 \) roads and another path of \( n - 1 \) roads, but they share some roads).

4. **Constructing the Paths**:
   - If \( k \geq n + 1 \), the program constructs a chain of cities starting with `a` and `c`, then adding all other cities that are not `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`.
   - It appends `b` and `d` to the chain.
   - The program then creates two paths:
     - `p1` is the original chain with the last two elements swapped to form a valid path from `a` to `b`.
     - `p2` is the original chain with the first two elements swapped to form a valid path from `c` to `d`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the two paths if they can be formed.
   - If \( k < n + 1 \), it prints `-1` because it is impossible to form the required paths with the given number of roads.

### Why the Program is Correct:
- **Special Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the special case where \( n = 4 \) by printing `-1` because it is impossible to form two distinct Hamiltonian paths with only 4 cities.
- **Road Constraint Check**: The program ensures that the number of roads \( k \) is sufficient to form the required paths.
- **Path Construction**: The program constructs the paths in a way that ensures all cities are visited exactly once, and the paths start and end at the specified cities.
- **Output Format**: The program outputs the paths in the required format, or `-1` if it is impossible to form the paths.

Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and is therefore correct.
