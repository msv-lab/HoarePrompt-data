You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bearland has n cities, numbered 1 through n. Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.

Bear Limak was once in a city a and he wanted to go to a city b. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally: 

  * There is no road between a and b. 
  * There exists a sequence (path) of n distinct cities v1, v2, ..., vn that v1 = a, vn = b and there is a road between vi and vi + 1 for <image>. 



On the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city c and a city d. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of n distinct cities u1, u2, ..., un that u1 = c, un = d and there is a road between ui and ui + 1 for <image>.

Also, Limak thinks that there are at most k roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.

Given n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v1, ..., vn) and (u1, ..., un) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.

The second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n).

Output

Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v1, v2, ..., vn where v1 = a and vn = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u1, u2, ..., un where u1 = c and un = d.

Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v1, v2), (v2, v3), ..., (vn - 1, vn), (u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (un - 1, un). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.

Examples

Input

7 11
2 4 7 3


Output

2 7 1 3 6 5 4
7 1 5 4 6 2 3


Input

1000 999
10 20 30 40


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.

    (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 4:
        print('-1')
    elif k >= n + 1:
        chain = [a, c]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in [a, b, c, d]:
                chain.append(i)
        chain.append(b)
        chain.append(d)
        p1 = list(chain)
        (p1[-1], p1[-2]) = (p1[-2], p1[-1])
        print(' '.join(map(str, p1)))
        p2 = list(chain)
        (p2[0], p2[1]) = (p2[1], p2[0])
        print(' '.join(map(str, p2)))
    else:
        print('-1')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n == 4` and `k >= n + 1` correctly. According to the problem statement, for `n == 4`, it should always print `-1` because it is impossible to construct two distinct Hamiltonian paths between the given pairs of cities without creating more than `k` roads. However, the program incorrectly prints `-1` for all cases when `n == 4`, regardless of the value of `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
1 2 3 4
```
Here, `n = 4`, `k = 5`, and the cities are `1, 2, 3, 4`. According to the problem statement, it is possible to construct two paths that meet the conditions, but the program will print `-1`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if `n == 4` and `k >= 5` (since `n + 1 = 5`), and in that case, attempt to construct the paths. For `n == 4` and `k < 5`, it should print `-1` as it is indeed impossible.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains four distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function then performs the following checks and actions:

1. If `n` is 4, the function prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is less than `n + 1`, the function also prints `-1`.
3. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the function constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and finally appends `b` and `d` to the list. It then creates two permutations of `chain`:
   - `p1`: The last two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   - `p2`: The first two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   The function prints both `p1` and `p2` as space-separated strings.

After the function executes, the final state of the program is:
- If `n` is 4 or `k` is less than `n + 1`, `-1` is printed to the console.
- If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, two lines of space-separated integers representing the permutations `p1` and `p2` are printed to the console.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
