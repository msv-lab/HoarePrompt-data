You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bearland has n cities, numbered 1 through n. Cities are connected via bidirectional roads. Each road connects two distinct cities. No two roads connect the same pair of cities.

Bear Limak was once in a city a and he wanted to go to a city b. There was no direct connection so he decided to take a long walk, visiting each city exactly once. Formally: 

  * There is no road between a and b. 
  * There exists a sequence (path) of n distinct cities v1, v2, ..., vn that v1 = a, vn = b and there is a road between vi and vi + 1 for <image>. 



On the other day, the similar thing happened. Limak wanted to travel between a city c and a city d. There is no road between them but there exists a sequence of n distinct cities u1, u2, ..., un that u1 = c, un = d and there is a road between ui and ui + 1 for <image>.

Also, Limak thinks that there are at most k roads in Bearland. He wonders whether he remembers everything correctly.

Given n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v1, ..., vn) and (u1, ..., un) to satisfy all the given conditions? Find any solution or print -1 if it's impossible.

Input

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively.

The second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n).

Output

Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v1, v2, ..., vn where v1 = a and vn = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u1, u2, ..., un where u1 = c and un = d.

Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v1, v2), (v2, v3), ..., (vn - 1, vn), (u1, u2), (u2, u3), ..., (un - 1, un). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road.

Examples

Input

7 11
2 4 7 3


Output

2 7 1 3 6 5 4
7 1 5 4 6 2 3


Input

1000 999
10 20 30 40


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.

Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 4:
        print('-1')
    elif k >= n + 1:
        chain = [a, c]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in [a, b, c, d]:
                chain.append(i)
        chain.append(b)
        chain.append(d)
        p1 = list(chain)
        (p1[-1], p1[-2]) = (p1[-2], p1[-1])
        print(' '.join(map(str, p1)))
        p2 = list(chain)
        (p2[0], p2[1]) = (p2[1], p2[0])
        print(' '.join(map(str, p2)))
    else:
        print('-1')


```
Output hints: The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains four distinct integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function then performs the following checks and actions:

1. If `n` is 4, the function prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is less than `n + 1`, the function also prints `-1`.
3. If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, the function constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and finally appends `b` and `d` to the list. It then creates two permutations of `chain`:
   - `p1`: The last two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   - `p2`: The first two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   The function prints both `p1` and `p2` as space-separated strings.

After the function executes, the final state of the program is:
- If `n` is 4 or `k` is less than `n + 1`, `-1` is printed to the console.
- If `n` is not 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, two lines of space-separated integers representing the permutations `p1` and `p2` are printed to the console.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
