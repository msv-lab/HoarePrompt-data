Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the following edge cases:

1. **Handling the Case When \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints `-1` when \( n = 4 \), which is correct because it is impossible to form two distinct Hamiltonian paths in a graph with only 4 vertices without creating a cycle or reusing edges.

2. **Handling the Case When \( k < n + 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints `-1` when \( k < n + 1 \), which is correct because it is impossible to form two distinct Hamiltonian paths with fewer than \( n + 1 \) edges.

3. **Constructing Paths for \( n > 4 \) and \( k \geq n + 1 \)**:
   - The program constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and finally appends `b` and `d` to the list. It then creates two permutations of `chain`:
     - `p1`: The last two elements of `chain` are swapped.
     - `p2`: The first two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that the paths `p1` and `p2` will always be valid Hamiltonian paths. For example, if the cities `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positioned in such a way that swapping the last two elements or the first two elements results in a path that does not form a valid Hamiltonian path, the program will still print these paths, leading to incorrect output.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
7 11
2 4 7 3
```

The program constructs the `chain` as follows:
- `chain = [2, 7, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3]`

Then it creates:
- `p1 = [2, 7, 1, 5, 6, 3, 4]` (swapping the last two elements)
- `p2 = [7, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3]` (swapping the first two elements)

However, the paths `p1` and `p2` may not form valid Hamiltonian paths if the edges are not correctly connected. For example, if the edge between `6` and `3` does not exist, the path `p1` is invalid. Similarly, if the edge between `7` and `2` does not exist, the path `p2` is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the constructed paths are valid Hamiltonian paths for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect for some potential cases. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
