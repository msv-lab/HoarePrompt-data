Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description in all potential cases. Specifically, the construction of the paths `p1` and `p2` may not always satisfy the conditions that there is no direct road between `a` and `b`, and no direct road between `c` and `d`.

Here are the issues:

1. **Path Construction**: The code constructs the `chain` list by starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and then appending `b` and `d`. This construction assumes that `a` and `c` are not directly connected, and `b` and `d` are not directly connected. However, this assumption is not guaranteed by the problem constraints.

2. **Permutations**: The permutations `p1` and `p2` are created by swapping the last two elements and the first two elements of the `chain` list, respectively. This approach does not ensure that the paths `p1` and `p2` do not contain direct roads between `a` and `b`, or `c` and `d`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code handles the case when `n` is 4 by printing `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to construct the required paths with only 4 cities. However, the code does not handle other edge cases or constraints effectively.

### Example of Failure

Consider the input:
```
5 6
1 5 2 4
```

The code will construct the `chain` list as:
```
chain = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]
```

Then, the permutations `p1` and `p2` will be:
```
p1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
p2 = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
```

However, in this case, the path `p1` contains a direct road between `1` and `5`, which violates the condition that there is no direct road between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion

The code does not guarantee that the constructed paths will always satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
