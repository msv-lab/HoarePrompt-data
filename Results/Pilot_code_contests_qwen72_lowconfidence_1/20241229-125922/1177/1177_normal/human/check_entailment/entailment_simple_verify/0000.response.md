Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program. Specifically, the program only checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, which is not sufficient according to the problem description. The problem states that `k` can be as low as `n - 1`, which means there can be exactly `n - 1` roads. However, the program will incorrectly output `-1` for cases where `k` is between `n - 1` and `n + 1`.

For example, consider the input:
```
7 8
2 4 7 3
```
Here, `k` is 8, which is greater than `n - 1` (6) but less than `n + 1` (8). The program will output `-1` because `k` is not greater than or equal to `n + 1`, even though a valid solution exists.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program does not handle the case where `k` is between `n - 1` and `n + 1`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect for this specific scenario.
