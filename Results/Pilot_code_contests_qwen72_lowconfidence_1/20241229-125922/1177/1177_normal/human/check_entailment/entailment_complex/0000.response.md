Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description in all specified cases. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads `n` and `k` from the first line of input.
   - It then reads `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the second line of input.
   - These values are used to determine the paths and the feasibility of the solution.

2. **Special Case Handling (n = 4):**
   - If `n` is 4, the program immediately prints `-1` and exits.
   - This is correct because for `n = 4`, it is impossible to construct two distinct Hamiltonian paths (paths visiting each city exactly once) that start and end at the specified cities without using more than `k` roads, given the constraints on `k`.

3. **Feasibility Check (k < n + 1):**
   - If `k` is less than `n + 1`, the program prints `-1` and exits.
   - This is correct because constructing two distinct Hamiltonian paths requires at least `n + 1` roads (one path of `n - 1` roads and another path of `n - 1` roads, with one road shared between the two paths).

4. **Path Construction (k â‰¥ n + 1):**
   - The program constructs a list `chain` starting with `a` and `c`, followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and finally appends `b` and `d`.
   - It then creates two permutations of `chain`:
     - `p1`: The last two elements of `chain` are swapped.
     - `p2`: The first two elements of `chain` are swapped.
   - These permutations are printed as space-separated strings.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling Special Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the special case where `n = 4` by printing `-1` and exiting.
  - It also correctly handles the case where `k < n + 1` by printing `-1` and exiting.

- **Path Construction:**
  - The construction of the `chain` ensures that all cities are visited exactly once, and the paths start and end at the specified cities.
  - Swapping the last two elements in `p1` and the first two elements in `p2` ensures that the paths are distinct and meet the requirements of the problem.

- **Road Constraints:**
  - The program ensures that the total number of roads used is at most `2n - 2`, which is within the allowed limit of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
