Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n + 1` but still greater than or equal to `n - 1`. According to the problem description, `k` can be as low as `n - 1`, which means there can be exactly `n - 1` roads. However, the program only checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, which is not always necessary. For example, consider the following input:

```
7 8
2 4 7 3
```

In this case, `k` is 8, which is greater than `n - 1` (6) but less than `n + 1` (8). The program will output `-1` because `k` is not greater than or equal to `n + 1`, even though a valid solution exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
