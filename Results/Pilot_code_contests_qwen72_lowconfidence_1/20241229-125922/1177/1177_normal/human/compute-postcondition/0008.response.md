To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. However, given the initial conditions, we know that `n` is already constrained to be between 4 and 1000 (inclusive), so `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Let's break down the initial state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1.
- `chain` is `[a, c]`.

Given these conditions, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already constrained to be at least 4, the loop will always execute at least once.

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to start executing is the initialization of the loop variable `i`. The loop variable `i` should be set to 1 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `chain` is `[a, c]`, `i` is 1**
