The values of `n` and `k` are updated by reading two integers from the standard input and splitting them. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, and their conditions still hold.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from input such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.**
