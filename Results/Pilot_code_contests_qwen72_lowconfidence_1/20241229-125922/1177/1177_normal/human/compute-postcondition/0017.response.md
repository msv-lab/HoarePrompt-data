Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `i` is 3. If `3` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `chain` remains `[a, c]`.***
