The provided code snippet is:
```
print(' '.join(map(str, p2)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000.
   - `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.
   - `n` is not equal to 4.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1.
   - `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.
   - `p1` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `d`, and finally followed by `b`.
   - `p2` is `[c, a]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The code prints the elements of `p2` as a space-separated string.
   - `p2` is a list constructed as `[c, a]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The elements of `p2` are converted to strings and joined with spaces.
   - The resulting string is printed.

4. **Output State:**
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `chain`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
   - The only action is the printing of the elements of `p2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`, `p1` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `d`, and finally followed by `b`, `p2` is `[c, a]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.**
