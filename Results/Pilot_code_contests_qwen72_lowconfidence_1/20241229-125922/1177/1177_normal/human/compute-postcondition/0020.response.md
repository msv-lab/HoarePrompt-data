The code snippet `chain.append(d)` adds the integer `d` to the end of the list `chain`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000
- `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`
- `n` is not equal to 4
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1
- `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`

After executing the code:
- The list `chain` now includes the integer `d` at the end.

Therefore, the updated `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`, and finally followed by `d`.**
