The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by reading four integers from the input. These new values will replace the previous values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers read from input and are distinct such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.**
