The code snippet `print('-1')` outputs `-1` to the console. This operation does not alter the values of any variables or affect the program state in terms of variable assignments or conditions. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `-1`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers read from input and are distinct such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 4, and `k` is less than `n` + 1, and `-1` has been printed to the console.**
