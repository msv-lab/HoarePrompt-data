The code appends the value of `i` to the list `chain`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `chain` could be either `[a, c, 2]` or `[a, c]` depending on whether `3` is in `[a, b, c, d]`.

- If `3` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, `chain` is `[a, c, 2]`, and after appending `i` (which is 3), `chain` becomes `[a, c, 2, 3]`.
- If `3` is in `[a, b, c, d]`, `chain` is `[a, c]`, and after appending `i` (which is 3), `chain` becomes `[a, c, 3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `i` is 3, and if `3` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 2, 3]`. Otherwise, `chain` is `[a, c, 3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `i` is 3, if `3` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 2, 3]`, otherwise `chain` is `[a, c, 3]`**
