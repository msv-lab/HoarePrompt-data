The code `chain.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `chain`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `chain` is `[a, c]`. After appending `i` to `chain`, the new value of `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`**.
