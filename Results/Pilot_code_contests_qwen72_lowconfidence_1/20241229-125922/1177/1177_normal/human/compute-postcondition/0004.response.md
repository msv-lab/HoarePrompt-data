The code snippet provided is:

```
print('-1')
```

This code prints `-1` to the console. It does not modify any variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers read from input and are distinct such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.
- The current value of `n` is 4.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 4, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` ≤ 6, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ 4, and `-1` has been printed to the console.**
