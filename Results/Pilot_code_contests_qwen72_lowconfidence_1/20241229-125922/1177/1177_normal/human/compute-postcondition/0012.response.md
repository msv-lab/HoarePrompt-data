To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000.
- `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`.
- `n` is not equal to 4.
- `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If `i` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 1]`. Otherwise, `chain` remains `[a, c]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `2`.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1, it will now be 2.
- **`chain`**: The value of `chain` depends on whether `i` (now 2) is in `[a, b, c, d]`. If 2 is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` will be `[a, c, 2]`. Otherwise, `chain` remains `[a, c]`.

### Final State:
- `n` remains the same (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000).
- `k` remains the same (`n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2).
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain the same (1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`).
- `n` is still not equal to 4.
- `k` is still greater than or equal to `n` + 1.
- `i` is now 2.
- `chain` is `[a, c, 2]` if 2 is not in `[a, b, c, d]`; otherwise, `chain` remains `[a, c]`.

### State:
**`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `i` is 2. If `i` is not in `[a, b, c, d]`, then `chain` is `[a, c, 2]`. Otherwise, `chain` remains `[a, c]`.**
