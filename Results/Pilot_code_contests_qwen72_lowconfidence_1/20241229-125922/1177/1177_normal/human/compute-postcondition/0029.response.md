Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the integers read from input and are distinct such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 4. If `k` ≥ `n` + 1, the elements of `p2` are printed. If `k` < `n` + 1, `-1` is printed to the console.***
