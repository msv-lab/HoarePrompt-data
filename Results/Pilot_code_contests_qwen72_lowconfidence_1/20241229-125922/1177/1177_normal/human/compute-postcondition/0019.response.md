The code `chain.append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the end of the list `chain`. Given the initial state, `chain` initially consists of `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`. After appending `b`, the new `chain` will be `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]`, and then followed by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that `n` - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2`n` - 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` ≤ `n`, `n` is not equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1, `chain` is `[a, c]` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` that are not in `[a, b, c, d]` and then followed by `b`.**
