The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the number of matryoshka dolls. It then generates a list `a` of `n` tuples, each tuple `(ep, sp)` representing the outer and inner volumes of a matryoshka doll, where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`. The list `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`.

The function processes this list to compute the best possible way to nest the matryoshka dolls, using a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming techniques. It maintains several data structures:
- `eps`: A list of unique outer volumes `ep` in the order they appear in `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configuration for each unique `ep`.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)` after processing.
- `er`: A list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last inner volume for that `ep` in `a`.

After processing, the function uses the `er` list to determine the final nesting configuration and prints the total count of the best possible nesting configuration. The final state of the program includes:
- `a`: A sorted list of `n` tuples `(ep, sp)`.
- `eps`: A list of unique `ep` values from `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configurations.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)`.
- `er`: An empty list if it was non-empty initially.
- `ans`: A tuple containing the final outer volume and the total count of the best possible nesting configuration.
