You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`, `n` is an input integer, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly, `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear, `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`. If `er` is non-empty, `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element), `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`, `ans` is the result of `update(update((e, 0), d[e]), d[e])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `er` is empty, `er` is an empty list, `e` does not exist, `s` does not exist, `sb` does not exist, `ans` is not updated, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
```
while sb < e:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
