An `IndexError` can occur in the `try` block when attempting to access or modify `best[len(eps) - 1]` if `len(eps) - 1` is out of the bounds of the `best` list. This would happen if `len(eps) - 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `best`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Try Block Execution:**
   - The code attempts to update `best[len(eps) - 1]` using the function `update2` with the arguments `best[len(eps) - 1]` and `(ep - g, c)`.
   - If `len(eps) - 1` is within the bounds of the `best` list, this operation will succeed, and `best[len(eps) - 1]` will be updated to the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`.

2. **Except Block Execution:**
   - If `len(eps) - 1` is out of bounds (i.e., `len(eps) - 1 >= len(best)`), an `IndexError` will be raised.
   - In this case, the `except` block will handle the `IndexError`:
     - If `len(eps) == 1`, it appends the tuple `(ep - g, c)` to `best`.
     - If `len(eps) > 1`, it appends the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` to `best`.

### Summary of the Try-Except Statement:

- **Try Block:**
  - Updates `best[len(eps) - 1]` to the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) - 1` is within bounds.
- **Except Block:**
  - Handles the `IndexError` by appending the appropriate value to `best` based on the length of `eps`.

### Final Output State:

**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is a list where, if no `IndexError` occurs, `best[len(eps) - 1]` is now `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`, and if an `IndexError` occurs, `best` has a new element appended, which is either `(ep - g, c)` if `len(eps) == 1` or `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) > 1`; `d` is a dictionary with `ep` as a key and `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the result of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`.**
