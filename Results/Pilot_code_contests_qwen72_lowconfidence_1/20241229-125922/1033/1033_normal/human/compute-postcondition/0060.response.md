Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `er` is updated based on the conditions provided; `eps` is updated based on the conditions provided; `best` is updated based on the conditions provided; `d` is a dictionary with `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`**.
