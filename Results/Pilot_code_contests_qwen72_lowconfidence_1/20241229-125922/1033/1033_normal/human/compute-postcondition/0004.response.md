Output State: **The program returns the integer value o[0], which represents the outer volume of the matryoshka, and (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD, where o[1] and n[1] are integers representing counts or cumulative values, and MOD is the modulus value used in the calculation. Since n[0] is equal to o[0], the first returned value is the same as n[0].**
