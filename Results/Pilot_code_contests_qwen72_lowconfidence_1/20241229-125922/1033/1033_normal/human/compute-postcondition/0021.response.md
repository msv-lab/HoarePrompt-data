Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]`.***
