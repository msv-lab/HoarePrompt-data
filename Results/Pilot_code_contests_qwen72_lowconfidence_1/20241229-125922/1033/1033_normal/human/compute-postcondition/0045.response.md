The code snippet assigns the value of `ep` to `gap` and sets `count` to 0. Since the initial state is unknown, the only information we have is what is explicitly set by the code. The variable `ep` remains unchanged, but its value is now also the value of `gap`. The variable `count` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`gap` is equal to `ep`, `count` is 0**
