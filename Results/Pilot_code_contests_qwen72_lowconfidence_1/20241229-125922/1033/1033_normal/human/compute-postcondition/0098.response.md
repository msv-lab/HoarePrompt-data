The value of `sb` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `s`. Since `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, and `sb` was already the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`, the new value of `sb` is the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`, `n` is an input integer, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly, `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear, `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`, `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element and the last tuple has been removed), `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`, `ans` is the result of `update(update((e, 0), d[e]), d[e])`.
