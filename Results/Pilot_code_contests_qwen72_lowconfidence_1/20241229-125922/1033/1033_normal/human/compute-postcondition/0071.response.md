The code snippet provided updates a list named `best` by appending the result of a function call `update2`. The function `update2` is called with two arguments: the second-to-last element of the list `eps` and a tuple `(ep - g, c)`.

- `best` is assumed to be a list.
- `eps` is assumed to be a list with at least two elements since `len(eps) - 2` is used to index it.
- `ep`, `g`, and `c` are assumed to be defined variables with appropriate values for the operation `ep - g`.

The effect of this code is to append a new element to the list `best`. The new element is the result of calling `update2` with the specified arguments. The exact value of the new element depends on the implementation of `update2` and the values of `ep`, `g`, and `c`.

Since the initial state is unknown, we can only specify that `best` now has one more element than before, which is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`.

Output State: **`best` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`; `eps` is a list with at least two elements; `ep`, `g`, and `c` are defined variables.**
