The code snippet `er.append([ep, sp])` appends a new list `[ep, sp]` to the existing list `er`. Given the initial state, this operation updates the value of `er`.

- `er` was initially an empty list or the last element of `er` was not equal to `ep`.
- After appending `[ep, sp]`, the last element of `er` will be `[ep, sp]`.

The other variables (`a`, `n`, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`, `eps`, `best`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `er` is a list containing the last element `[ep, sp]`.**
