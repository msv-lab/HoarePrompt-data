The code snippet `best.append((ep - g, c))` appends a tuple to the list `best`. The tuple consists of two elements: the first element is the result of the subtraction `ep - g`, and the second element is the variable `c`.

- `best` is updated by appending a new tuple.
- The value of `ep - g` is computed and used as the first element of the tuple.
- The value of `c` is used as the second element of the tuple.

Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot specify the exact values of `ep`, `g`, and `c`, but we can describe the changes in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`best` is a list containing an additional tuple `(ep - g, c)`**.
