The line of code `g, c = sp - best[i][0], best[i][1]` updates the values of `g` and `c` based on the current values of `sp`, `best`, and `i`.

- `g` is assigned the value of `sp - best[i][0]`.
- `c` is assigned the value of `best[i][1]`.

Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
- `er` is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `eps` is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `best` is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `d` is a dictionary with `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value.
- `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.

After executing the code snippet:

- `g` is now `sp - best[i][0]`.
- `c` is now `best[i][1]`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `er` is updated based on the conditions provided; `eps` is updated based on the conditions provided; `best` is updated based on the conditions provided; `d` is a dictionary with `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`; `g` is `sp - best[i][0]`; `c` is `best[i][1]`.**
