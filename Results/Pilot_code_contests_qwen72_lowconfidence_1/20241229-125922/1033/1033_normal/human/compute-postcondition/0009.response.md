The code snippet `eps.append(ep)` adds the value of `ep` from the current tuple in the list `a` to the list `eps`. Given that `eps` was initially an empty list or the last element of `eps` was not equal to `ep`, after this operation, `eps` will contain one more element, which is the value of `ep`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `er` is an empty list**
