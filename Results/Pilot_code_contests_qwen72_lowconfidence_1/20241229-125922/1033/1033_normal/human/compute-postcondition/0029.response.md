The code snippet `best.append((ep - g, c))` impacts the list `best` by appending a tuple `(ep - g, c)` to it. Since the length of `eps` is 1, we can infer that `ep` is the first (and only) element in `eps`. However, the values of `g` and `c` are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The initial state mentions `State.UNKNOWN`, which suggests that some part of the state is not defined or known.

Given this, the output state will reflect the updated list `best` with the new tuple added to it, while keeping the other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **State.UNKNOWN, the length of `eps` is 1, `best` contains one additional tuple `(ep - g, c)`**
