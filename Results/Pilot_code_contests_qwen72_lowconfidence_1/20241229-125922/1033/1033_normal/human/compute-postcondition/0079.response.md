The code snippet `e, sb = er.pop()` performs the following actions:

- It removes the last element (a tuple) from the list `er`.
- It assigns the first element of the removed tuple to the variable `e`.
- It assigns the second element of the removed tuple to the variable `sb`.

Given the initial state, where `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a`, the impact of this code is:

- The length of `er` is reduced by 1.
- The variable `e` is assigned the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er`.
- The variable `sb` is assigned the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear; `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` where each pair is the result of applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`; `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element); `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `sb` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.**
