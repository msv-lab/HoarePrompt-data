The code snippet assigns the value of `sp` to `g` and the value `1` to `c`. Since `sp` is part of the tuple `(ep, sp)` in the list `a`, and given that `a` is a list of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(ep, sp)` with `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, the value of `g` is now the second element (`sp`) of the current tuple being processed.

The variable `c` is explicitly set to `1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`. `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`; `g` is `sp`, `c` is `1`.
