The code `best.append((ep - g, c))` impacts the `best` list by appending a tuple to it. The tuple consists of two elements: the first element is the result of subtracting the value of `g` from `ep`, and the second element is the value of `c`. The variables `ep`, `g`, and `c` are used in this operation, but their specific values are unknown. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **the state is unknown, `best` contains an additional tuple `(ep - g, c)`**
