The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters directly. It relies on an external sorted list `a` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(ep, sp)`, representing the outer and inner volumes of matryoshkas. The list `a` is expected to be non-empty and sorted based on the outer volume `ep`. The integers `ep` and `sp` satisfy the condition `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`.

The function processes this list and returns a result based on the processing of the matryoshka volumes.
