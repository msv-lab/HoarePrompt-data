Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`, `n` is an input integer, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly, `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear, `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`. If `er` is non-empty, `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element), `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`, `ans` is the result of `update(update((e, 0), d[e]), d[e])`. If `er` is empty, `er` is an empty list, `e` does not exist, `s` does not exist, `sb` does not exist, `ans` is the result of `update(ans, d[e])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Code Snippet:
```python
e, s = er.pop()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `e` is assigned the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
   - `s` is assigned the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
   - `er` is modified by removing the last tuple.

2. **Check Previous Values**:
   - `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element).
   - `e` and `s` are the values from the last tuple in `er`.

3. **Calculate the Result**:
   - After executing `e, s = er.pop()`, `e` and `s` are set to the values from the last tuple in `er`.
   - `er` is now the list without the last tuple.

Output State:
**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`, `n` is an input integer, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly, `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear, `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`, `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element and the last tuple has been removed), `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop, `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`, `ans` is the result of `update(update((e, 0), d[e]), d[e])`.**
