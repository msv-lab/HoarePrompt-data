The `KeyError` exception can occur at the line `gap, count = d[ep]` when `ep` is not a key in the dictionary `d`. Since the initial state specifies that `d` is an empty dictionary, accessing `d[ep]` will raise a `KeyError` unless `d` has been updated before this line of code is executed.

The `try` block attempts to assign the values from the dictionary `d` indexed by `ep` to the variables `gap` and `count`. If `ep` is not a key in `d`, the `except KeyError` block is executed, setting `gap` to `ep` and `count` to `0`.

### Summary of the Try-Except Statement:
- **Try Block**: Tries to assign the values from `d[ep]` to `gap` and `count`.
- **Except Block**: If `ep` is not a key in `d`, sets `gap` to `ep` and `count` to `0`.

### Program Output State After Execution:
- If `ep` is a key in `d`, `gap` and `count` are assigned the values from `d[ep]`.
- If `ep` is not a key in `d`, `gap` is set to `ep` and `count` is set to `0`.

### Final Output State:
**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary (assuming it was updated before this code snippet); `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` is set to `ep` and `count` is set to `0` if `ep` is not a key in `d`, otherwise `gap` and `count` are assigned the values from `d[ep]`.**
