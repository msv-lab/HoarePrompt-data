The code snippet `eps.append(ep)` appends the value `ep` from the next tuple in the list `a` to the list `eps`. This impacts the state of `eps`, which now includes this new value.

- `a` remains a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` remain defined and working correctly.
- `eps` is now a list containing the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a`.
- `best` remains a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration.
- `d` remains a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value.
- `er` remains a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a`.
- `i` remains `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1` using the new `sp` from the next tuple in `a`.
- If `i` is `-1`, `g` remains `sp` and `c` remains `1`.
- Otherwise, `g` remains `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` remains `best[i][1]`.
- `gap` and `count` remain updated based on the result of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list containing the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1` using the new `sp` from the next tuple in `a`; if `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`, otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the result of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`.**
