The code snippet provided appends a new tuple `[ep, sp]` to the list `er`. This impacts the state of `er` while keeping all other conditions and variables unchanged.

- `er` now includes the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`, `eps`, `best`, `d`, `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, `count`) remain in their previous states unless explicitly updated by the code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that has been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1` using the new `sp` from the next tuple in `a`; if `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`, otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the result of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`. If `eps` is not empty and the last element of `eps` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `eps`, `best`, `d`, `er`, `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, or `count`.**
