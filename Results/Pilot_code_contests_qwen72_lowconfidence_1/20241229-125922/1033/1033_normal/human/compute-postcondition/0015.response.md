Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary. If `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`, `er` is updated such that it either remains empty or the last element is `[ep, sp]`. If `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`, the second element of the last tuple in `er` is `sp`.***
