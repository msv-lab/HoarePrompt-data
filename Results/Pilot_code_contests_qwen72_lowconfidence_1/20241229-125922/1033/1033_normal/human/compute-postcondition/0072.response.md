Postcondition: ***If `len(eps) == 1`, `best` is a list containing an additional tuple `(ep - g, c)`. Otherwise, `best` is a list with an additional element appended, which is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`, and `eps` is a list with at least two elements. `ep`, `g`, and `c` are defined variables.***
