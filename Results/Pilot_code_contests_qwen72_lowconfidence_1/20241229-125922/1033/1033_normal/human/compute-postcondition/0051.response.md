The code snippet appends the result of the function `update2` called with arguments `best[len(eps) - 2]` and `(ep - g, c)` to the list `best`.

- `best.append(...)` modifies the list `best` by adding a new element at the end.
- The new element is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`.
- The length of `best` increases by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: **the state is unknown, `best` has one more element appended which is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`, the length of `best` is increased by 1**.
