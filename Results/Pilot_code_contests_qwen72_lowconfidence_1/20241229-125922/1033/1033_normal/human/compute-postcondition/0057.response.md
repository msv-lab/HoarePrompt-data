Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `er` includes the new tuple `[ep, sp]` at the end.**
