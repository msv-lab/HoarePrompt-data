The code snippet `e, s = er.pop()` performs the following actions:

1. It removes the last element from the list `er`.
2. It assigns the first element of the removed tuple to the variable `e`.
3. It assigns the second element of the removed tuple to the variable `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
- `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear.
- `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` where each pair is the result of applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`.
- `er` is a non-empty list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element).
- `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
- `sb` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
- `ans` is the result of `update((e, 0), d[e])`.

After executing the code snippet `e, s = er.pop()`, the following changes occur:
- The last element of `er` is removed.
- The variable `e` is updated to the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
- The variable `s` is updated to the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear; `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` where each pair is the result of applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`; `er` is a non-empty list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element); `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `sb` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `ans` is the result of `update((e, 0), d[e])`.**
