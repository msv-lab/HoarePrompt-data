Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear; `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` where each pair is the result of applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`. If `er` is non-empty, `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element); `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop; `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`; `ans` is the result of `update((e, 0), d[e])`. If `er` is empty, `er` remains an empty list; `e` and `s` do not exist because `er` is empty; `sb` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop (which no longer exists because `er` is empty); `ans` is not updated because `er` is empty.***
