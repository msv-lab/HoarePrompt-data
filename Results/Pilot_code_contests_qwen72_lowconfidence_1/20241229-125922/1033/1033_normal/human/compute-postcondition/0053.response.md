An `IndexError` can occur in the line `best[len(eps) - 1] = update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))` if the index `len(eps) - 1` is out of bounds for the `best` list. This can happen if `best` does not have enough elements to accommodate the index `len(eps) - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Summary:

1. **Try Block Execution:**
   - The program attempts to update the value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` using the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`.
   - If `best` has enough elements to accommodate the index `len(eps) - 1`, the update is successful, and the program continues without raising an exception.
   - **Output State After Try Block:** The updated value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.

2. **Except Block Execution:**
   - If an `IndexError` is raised, it means that the index `len(eps) - 1` is out of bounds for the `best` list.
   - The program checks the length of `eps`:
     - If `len(eps) == 1`, the program appends the tuple `(ep - g, c)` to `best`.
     - If `len(eps) > 1`, the program appends the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` to `best`.
   - **Output State After Except Block:**
     - If `len(eps) == 1`, `best` contains an additional tuple `(ep - g, c)`.
     - If `len(eps) > 1`, `best` has one more element appended, which is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))`, and the length of `best` is increased by 1.

### Final Output State:
**Output State: `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is -1, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the return values of `update((gap, count), (g, c)). If the index `len(eps) - 1` is within bounds for `best`, the updated value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `best` is updated by appending `(ep - g, c)` if `len(eps) == 1`, or by appending the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) > 1`.**
