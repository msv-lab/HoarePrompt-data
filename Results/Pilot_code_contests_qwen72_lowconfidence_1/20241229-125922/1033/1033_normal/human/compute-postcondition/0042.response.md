The code snippet `g, c = sp - best[i][0], best[i][1]` updates the variables `g` and `c` based on the values of `sp`, `best[i][0]`, and `best[i][1]`.

- `g` is assigned the value of `sp - best[i][0]`.
- `c` is assigned the value of `best[i][1]`.

The rest of the variables (`a`, `n`, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`, `eps`, `best`, `d`, `er`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`. `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`; `g` is `sp - best[i][0]`; `c` is `best[i][1]`.**
