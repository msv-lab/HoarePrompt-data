The `debug_print(best)` function call prints the contents of the `best` list, which contains pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from the application of `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`. This function does not alter the state of any variables; it only outputs the current state of `best`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing `best`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear; `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` where each pair is the result of applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`; `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a`.**
