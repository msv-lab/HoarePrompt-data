The provided code snippet `ans = update(ans, d[e])` impacts the state of the `ans` variable by updating its value using the `update` function, which takes the current `ans` and the value associated with the key `e` in the dictionary `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
- `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear.
- `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`.
- If `er` is non-empty:
  - `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element).
  - `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
  - `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
  - `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`.
  - `ans` is the result of `update((e, 0), d[e])`.
- If `er` is empty:
  - `er` remains an empty list.
  - `e` and `s` do not exist because `er` is empty.
  - `sb` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop (which no longer exists because `er` is empty).
  - `ans` is not updated because `er` is empty.

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Check if `er` is non-empty:**
   - If `er` is non-empty, `e` and `s` are defined as the `ep` and `sp` values from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
   - `sb` is updated to the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`.
   - `ans` is initially set to the result of `update((e, 0), d[e])`.

2. **Execute the given code snippet:**
   - `ans` is updated again by calling `update(ans, d[e])`.

### Output State:
- If `er` is non-empty:
  - `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
  - `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear.
  - `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`.
  - `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`.
  - `er` is a list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last `sp` for that `ep` in `a` (reduced by one element).
  - `e` is the `ep` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
  - `s` is the `sp` value from the last tuple in `er` before the pop.
  - `sb` is the maximum of the previous `sb` and `s`.
  - `ans` is the result of `update(update((e, 0), d[e]), d[e])`.

- If `er` is empty:
  - `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)`.
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
  - `eps` is a list of unique `ep` values from `a` in the order they appear.
  - `best` is a list of pairs `(gap, count)` resulting from applying `update2` to the best values for each unique `ep` in `eps`.
  - `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `ep` from `a` and the value is the final `(gap, count)` for that `ep`.
  - `er` is an empty list.
  - `e` does not exist.
  - `s` does not exist.
  - `sb` does not exist.
  - `ans` is not updated.
