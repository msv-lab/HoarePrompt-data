Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

Initial State:
- `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
- `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`.
- `best` is an empty list.
- `d` is an empty dictionary.
- `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`.
- `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`, and `i` is not `-1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
g, c = sp - best[i][0], best[i][1]
```

Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `sp` is the second element of the current tuple in `a`.
   - `i` is the index determined by `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`, and it is guaranteed not to be `-1`.
   - `best` is initially an empty list, but for the purpose of this calculation, it must contain elements for the indexing to work.

2. **Calculate New Values:**
   - `g` is calculated as `sp - best[i][0]`.
   - `c` is assigned the value of `best[i][1]`.

3. **Update State:**
   - The values of `g` and `c` are now defined based on the above calculations.
   - The rest of the variables (`a`, `n`, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`, `eps`, `best`, `d`, `er`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State:
**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`, and `i` is not `-1`; `g` is `sp - best[i][0]`; `c` is `best[i][1]`.**
