To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly.
- `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`.
- `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration.
- `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value.
- `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`.
- `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is -1, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1].
- `gap` and `count` are updated based on the return values of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`.
- If the index `len(eps) - 1` is within bounds for `best`, the updated value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `best` is updated by appending `(ep - g, c)` if `len(eps) == 1`, or by appending the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) > 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (ep, sp) in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The loop iterates over the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `a`.
2. **Variables `ep` and `sp`**: These are the elements of the current tuple being processed. They will be updated to the next tuple in `a`.
3. **List `eps`**: This list may be updated to include the new `ep` if it is different from the last element of `eps`.
4. **List `best`**: This list may be updated based on the new values of `ep` and `sp`.
5. **Dictionary `d`**: This dictionary may be updated with the new `ep` and the updated `(gap, count)`.
6. **List `er`**: This list may be updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` if it is different from the last element of `er`.
7. **Variables `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, and `count`**: These variables are derived from the current state and will be recalculated for the next iteration.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- `a` must have at least one more tuple.
- `ep` and `sp` will be set to the next tuple in `a`.
- `eps` will be updated to include the new `ep` if it is different from the last element of `eps`.
- `best` will be updated based on the new values of `ep` and `sp`.
- `d` will be updated with the new `ep` and the updated `(gap, count)`.
- `er` will be updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` if it is different from the last element of `er`.
- `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, and `count` will be recalculated for the next iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`. If `i` is -1, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`. Otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the return values of `update((gap, count), (g, c)). If the index `len(eps) - 1` is within bounds for `best`, the updated value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `best` is updated by appending `(ep - g, c)` if `len(eps) == 1`, or by appending the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) > 1`.**
