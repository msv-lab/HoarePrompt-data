The code snippet provided is:

```python
i = bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `eps`: This is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`.
   - `sp`: This is the second element of the current tuple `(ep, sp)` from the list `a`.

2. **Function `bisect_right`**:
   - The `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module finds the insertion point for `sp` in the sorted list `eps` to maintain sorted order. It returns the index where `sp` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.

3. **Calculation of `i`**:
   - `i` is assigned the value of `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.
   - If `eps` is empty, `bisect_right(eps, sp)` will return 0, so `i` will be `-1`.
   - If `eps` contains elements, `bisect_right(eps, sp)` will return the index where `sp` would be inserted, and `i` will be one less than this index.

### Impact on Variables:
- `i` is updated based on the result of `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`, `eps`, `best`, `d`, `er`) remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 1 tuple; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is either an empty list or a list containing the value `ep`; `best` is an empty list; `d` is an empty dictionary; `er` is either empty or the last element of `er` is `[ep, sp]` if `er` is non-empty and the last element is `[ep, sp]`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.**
