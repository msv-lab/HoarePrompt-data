Initial State: `a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`. `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1` using the new `sp` from the next tuple in `a`; if `i` is `-1`, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`, otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the result of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`. If `eps` is not empty and the last element of `eps` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `eps`, `best`, `d`, `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, or `count`.

Code Snippet:
```python
i = bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. The code snippet updates the value of `i` to `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.
2. `bisect_right` returns the index where `sp` would fit in the sorted list `eps` to maintain order, or the length of `eps` if `sp` is greater than any element in `eps`.
3. Subtracting 1 from this index gives the largest index `j` such that `eps[j] < sp`, or `-1` if no such index exists.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is a list that may contain the value `ep` from the next tuple in `a` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is a list that may have been updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with the new `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is a list that may have been updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` from the next tuple in `a` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`. If `er` is not empty and the last element of `er` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `er`. `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`.**
