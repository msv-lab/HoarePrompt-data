The provided code snippet updates the second element of the last tuple in the list `er` to the value of `sp`.

- The last element of `er` is accessed using `er[-1]`.
- The second element of this tuple is set to the value of `sp`.

Therefore, the only change is to the second element of the last tuple in `er`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` tuples, each of the form `(ep, sp)` where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`, and `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`, and `a` must have at least 2 tuples; `n` is an input integer; `func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print` are defined and working correctly; `eps` is updated to include `ep` if it is empty or the last element of `eps` is not equal to `ep`; `best` is updated based on the previous iteration; `d` is a dictionary with `ep` as a key and the updated `(gap, count)` as its value; `er` is updated to include the new tuple `[ep, sp]` if `er` is empty or the last element of `er` is not equal to `ep`; `i` is `bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1`; if `i` is -1, `g` is `sp` and `c` is `1`; otherwise, `g` is `sp - best[i][0]` and `c` is `best[i][1]`; `gap` and `count` are updated based on the return values of `update((gap, count), (g, c))`; if the index `len(eps) - 1` is within bounds for `best`, the updated value of `best[len(eps) - 1]` is the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 1], (ep - g, c))`; if an `IndexError` occurs, `best` is updated by appending `(ep - g, c)` if `len(eps) == 1`, or by appending the result of `update2(best[len(eps) - 2], (ep - g, c))` if `len(eps) > 1`; if `eps` is not empty and the last element of `eps` is equal to `ep`, no changes are made to `eps`, `best`, `d`, `er`, `i`, `g`, `c`, `gap`, or `count`; the second element of the last tuple in `er` is now `sp`.**
