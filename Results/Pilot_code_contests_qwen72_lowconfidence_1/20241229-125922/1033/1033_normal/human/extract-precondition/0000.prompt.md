You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There are famous Russian nesting dolls named matryoshkas sold in one of the souvenir stores nearby, and you'd like to buy several of them. The store has n different matryoshkas. Any matryoshka is a figure of volume out_i with an empty space inside of volume in_i (of course, out_i > in_i).

You don't have much free space inside your bag, but, fortunately, you know that matryoshkas can be nested one inside another. Formally, let's call a set of matryoshkas nested if we can rearrange dolls in such a way, that the first doll can be nested inside the second one, the second doll — inside the third one and so on. Matryoshka i can be nested inside matryoshka j if out_i ≤ in_j. So only the last doll will take space inside your bag.

Let's call extra space of a nested set of dolls as a total volume of empty space inside this structure. Obviously, it's equal to in_{i_1} + (in_{i_2} - out_{i_1}) + (in_{i_3} - out_{i_2}) + ... + (in_{i_k} - out_{i_{k-1}}), where i_1, i_2, ..., i_k are the indices of the chosen dolls in the order they are nested in each other.

Finally, let's call a nested subset of the given sequence as big enough if there isn't any doll from the sequence that can be added to the nested subset without breaking its nested property.

You want to buy many matryoshkas, so you should choose a big enough nested subset to buy it. But you will be disappointed if too much space in your bag will be wasted, so you want to choose a big enough subset so that its extra space is minimum possible among all big enough subsets. Now you wonder, how many different nested subsets meet these conditions (they are big enough, and there is no big enough subset such that its extra space is less than the extra space of the chosen subset). Two subsets are considered different if there exists at least one index i such that one of the subsets contains the i-th doll, and another subset doesn't.

Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas.

The next n lines contain a description of each doll: two integers out_i and in_i (1 ≤ in_i < out_i ≤ 10^9) — the outer and inners volumes of the i-th matryoshka.

Output

Print one integer — the number of big enough nested subsets such that extra space of each of these subsets is minimum possible. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input


7
4 1
4 2
4 2
2 1
5 4
6 4
3 2


Output


6

Note

There are 6 big enough nested subsets with minimum possible extra space in the example: 

  * \{1, 5\}: we can't add any other matryoshka and keep it nested; it's extra space is 1; 
  * \{1, 6\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 6\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 6\}. 



There are no more "good" subsets because, for example, subset \{6, 7\} is not big enough (we can add the 4-th matryoshka to it) or subset \{4, 6, 7\} has extra space equal to 2.
Program:
```
def update2(o, n):
    if n[0] > o[0]:
        return n
    elif n[0] == o[0]:
        return (o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD)
    else:
        return o
```
