The function `func_2` accepts a callable `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It generates a nested list based on the dimensions specified in `*dim`. If `dim` is empty, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a nested list of depth equal to the length of `dim`, where each dimension's size corresponds to the values in `dim`, and each element is the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the nested structure is correctly formed according to the dimensions provided. If `dim` is not provided or is an empty tuple, the function simply calls `f()` and returns its result. Edge cases include handling an empty `dim` and ensuring that `f` is a valid callable. If `f` is not callable or if `dim` contains non-positive integers, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors.
