The function `func_3` does not take any parameters directly. However, it relies on external inputs and other functions (`func_1`, `update`, `update2`, `debug_print`) being defined and working correctly. It processes a sorted list `a` of tuples, each containing two integers `(ep, sp)` representing the outer and inner volumes of matryoshkas. The list `a` is expected to be non-empty and sorted based on the outer volume `ep`. The integers `ep` and `sp` satisfy the condition `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`.
