The input is provided through a function `input_as_list()` which returns a list of lists, where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of matryoshkas, followed by n lists, each containing two integers out_i and in_i (1 ≤ in_i < out_i ≤ 10^9) representing the outer and inner volumes of the i-th matryoshka.
