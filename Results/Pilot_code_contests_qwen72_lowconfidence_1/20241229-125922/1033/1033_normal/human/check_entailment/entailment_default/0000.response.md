Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description, particularly in handling edge cases and ensuring the correct computation of the minimum extra space for big enough nested subsets. Here are a few issues and edge cases that highlight the problems:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty Input:** The code does not explicitly handle the case where the input is empty (i.e., `n = 0`). While the problem description specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, it's good practice to consider edge cases.
   - **Single Doll:** The code does not clearly handle the case where there is only one doll. In this case, the doll itself forms a big enough nested subset, and the extra space is simply the inner volume of the doll.

2. **Correctness of the `func_3` Logic:**
   - **Binary Search and Indexing:** The use of `bisect_right` and subsequent indexing operations might lead to incorrect results if the binary search does not find a suitable position. Specifically, the line `i = bisect_right(eps, sp) - 1` can result in `i` being `-1`, which is handled but might not always be correct.
   - **Update Functions:** The `update` and `update2` functions are critical for maintaining the correct state of the best nested subsets. However, the logic in these functions, especially the handling of equal volumes and counts, might not always produce the correct results. For example, if multiple dolls have the same outer volume but different inner volumes, the updates might not be applied correctly.

3. **Final Computation:**
   - **Er List Processing:** The final part of the `func_3` function, which processes the `er` list to determine the final answer, might not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the loop that pops elements from `er` and updates the answer might miss some valid nested subsets or incorrectly count the number of valid subsets.

Given these issues, the code does not guarantee correctness for every potential case as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
