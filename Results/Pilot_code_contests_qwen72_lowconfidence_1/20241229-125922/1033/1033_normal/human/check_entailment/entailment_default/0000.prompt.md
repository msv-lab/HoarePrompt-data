You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are famous Russian nesting dolls named matryoshkas sold in one of the souvenir stores nearby, and you'd like to buy several of them. The store has n different matryoshkas. Any matryoshka is a figure of volume out_i with an empty space inside of volume in_i (of course, out_i > in_i).

You don't have much free space inside your bag, but, fortunately, you know that matryoshkas can be nested one inside another. Formally, let's call a set of matryoshkas nested if we can rearrange dolls in such a way, that the first doll can be nested inside the second one, the second doll — inside the third one and so on. Matryoshka i can be nested inside matryoshka j if out_i ≤ in_j. So only the last doll will take space inside your bag.

Let's call extra space of a nested set of dolls as a total volume of empty space inside this structure. Obviously, it's equal to in_{i_1} + (in_{i_2} - out_{i_1}) + (in_{i_3} - out_{i_2}) + ... + (in_{i_k} - out_{i_{k-1}}), where i_1, i_2, ..., i_k are the indices of the chosen dolls in the order they are nested in each other.

Finally, let's call a nested subset of the given sequence as big enough if there isn't any doll from the sequence that can be added to the nested subset without breaking its nested property.

You want to buy many matryoshkas, so you should choose a big enough nested subset to buy it. But you will be disappointed if too much space in your bag will be wasted, so you want to choose a big enough subset so that its extra space is minimum possible among all big enough subsets. Now you wonder, how many different nested subsets meet these conditions (they are big enough, and there is no big enough subset such that its extra space is less than the extra space of the chosen subset). Two subsets are considered different if there exists at least one index i such that one of the subsets contains the i-th doll, and another subset doesn't.

Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas.

The next n lines contain a description of each doll: two integers out_i and in_i (1 ≤ in_i < out_i ≤ 10^9) — the outer and inners volumes of the i-th matryoshka.

Output

Print one integer — the number of big enough nested subsets such that extra space of each of these subsets is minimum possible. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input


7
4 1
4 2
4 2
2 1
5 4
6 4
3 2


Output


6

Note

There are 6 big enough nested subsets with minimum possible extra space in the example: 

  * \{1, 5\}: we can't add any other matryoshka and keep it nested; it's extra space is 1; 
  * \{1, 6\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 6\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 6\}. 



There are no more "good" subsets because, for example, subset \{6, 7\} is not big enough (we can add the 4-th matryoshka to it) or subset \{4, 6, 7\} has extra space equal to 2.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the user input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the user input is empty, an empty list will be returned.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(f, *dim):
    return [func_2(f, *dim[1:]) for _ in range(dim[0])] if dim else f()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a callable `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It generates a nested list based on the dimensions specified in `*dim`. If `dim` is empty, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a nested list of depth equal to the length of `dim`, where each dimension's size corresponds to the values in `dim`, and each element is the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the nested structure is correctly formed according to the dimensions provided. If `dim` is not provided or is an empty tuple, the function simply calls `f()` and returns its result. Edge cases include handling an empty `dim` and ensuring that `f` is a valid callable. If `f` is not callable or if `dim` contains non-positive integers, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors.

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the number of matryoshka dolls. It then generates a list `a` of `n` tuples, each tuple `(ep, sp)` representing the outer and inner volumes of a matryoshka doll, where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`. The list `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`.

The function processes this list to compute the best possible way to nest the matryoshka dolls, using a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming techniques. It maintains several data structures:
- `eps`: A list of unique outer volumes `ep` in the order they appear in `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configuration for each unique `ep`.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)` after processing.
- `er`: A list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last inner volume for that `ep` in `a`.

After processing, the function uses the `er` list to determine the final nesting configuration and prints the total count of the best possible nesting configuration. The final state of the program includes:
- `a`: A sorted list of `n` tuples `(ep, sp)`.
- `eps`: A list of unique `ep` values from `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configurations.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)`.
- `er`: An empty list if it was non-empty initially.
- `ans`: A tuple containing the final outer volume and the total count of the best possible nesting configuration.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def update(o, n):
    if n[0] < o[0]:
        return n
    elif n[0] == o[0]:
        return (o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD)
    else:
        return o
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `update` takes two parameters `o` and `n`, each a tuple of two integers. The first element of each tuple represents a volume, and the second element represents a count. The function returns a tuple based on the following conditions:

1. If the volume in `n` (`n[0]`) is less than the volume in `o` (`o[0]`), the function returns `n`.
2. If the volumes in `o` and `n` are equal (`n[0] == o[0]`), the function returns a new tuple with the volume `o[0]` and the count `(o[1] + n[1]) % MOD`, where `MOD` is a constant integer greater than 1.
3. If the volume in `o` is less than the volume in `n` (`o[0] < n[0]`), the function returns `o`.

The function ensures that the returned tuple maintains the volume and count constraints as described above. Edge cases such as `n[0]` being equal to `o[0]` and the behavior of the modulo operation are correctly handled.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def update2(o, n):
    if n[0] > o[0]:
        return n
    elif n[0] == o[0]:
        return (o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD)
    else:
        return o
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `update2` takes two tuples `o` and `n`, each containing two integers. The function compares the first elements of these tuples (`o[0]` and `n[0]`) and returns one of the following:

1. If `n[0]` is greater than `o[0]`, the function returns the tuple `n`. This means the returned tuple contains the inner volume `n[0]` and a count or cumulative value `n[1]`.

2. If `n[0]` is equal to `o[0]`, the function returns a new tuple `(o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD)`. Here, `o[0]` is the outer volume, and the second element is the sum of `o[1]` and `n[1]`, taken modulo `MOD`.

3. If `n[0]` is less than `o[0]`, the function returns the tuple `o`. This means the returned tuple contains the outer volume `o[0]` and a count or cumulative value `o[1]`.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `o` and `n` are always tuples of exactly two integers. If either `o` or `n` is not a tuple or does not contain exactly two integers, the function will raise an error.
- The function does not handle cases where `MOD` is not defined or is zero, which would cause a division by zero error during the modulo operation.
- The function does not validate the types or values of `o[0]`, `o[1]`, `n[0]`, and `n[1]` to ensure they are integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-integer values are passed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
