You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are famous Russian nesting dolls named matryoshkas sold in one of the souvenir stores nearby, and you'd like to buy several of them. The store has n different matryoshkas. Any matryoshka is a figure of volume out_i with an empty space inside of volume in_i (of course, out_i > in_i).

You don't have much free space inside your bag, but, fortunately, you know that matryoshkas can be nested one inside another. Formally, let's call a set of matryoshkas nested if we can rearrange dolls in such a way, that the first doll can be nested inside the second one, the second doll — inside the third one and so on. Matryoshka i can be nested inside matryoshka j if out_i ≤ in_j. So only the last doll will take space inside your bag.

Let's call extra space of a nested set of dolls as a total volume of empty space inside this structure. Obviously, it's equal to in_{i_1} + (in_{i_2} - out_{i_1}) + (in_{i_3} - out_{i_2}) + ... + (in_{i_k} - out_{i_{k-1}}), where i_1, i_2, ..., i_k are the indices of the chosen dolls in the order they are nested in each other.

Finally, let's call a nested subset of the given sequence as big enough if there isn't any doll from the sequence that can be added to the nested subset without breaking its nested property.

You want to buy many matryoshkas, so you should choose a big enough nested subset to buy it. But you will be disappointed if too much space in your bag will be wasted, so you want to choose a big enough subset so that its extra space is minimum possible among all big enough subsets. Now you wonder, how many different nested subsets meet these conditions (they are big enough, and there is no big enough subset such that its extra space is less than the extra space of the chosen subset). Two subsets are considered different if there exists at least one index i such that one of the subsets contains the i-th doll, and another subset doesn't.

Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas.

The next n lines contain a description of each doll: two integers out_i and in_i (1 ≤ in_i < out_i ≤ 10^9) — the outer and inners volumes of the i-th matryoshka.

Output

Print one integer — the number of big enough nested subsets such that extra space of each of these subsets is minimum possible. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example

Input


7
4 1
4 2
4 2
2 1
5 4
6 4
3 2


Output


6

Note

There are 6 big enough nested subsets with minimum possible extra space in the example: 

  * \{1, 5\}: we can't add any other matryoshka and keep it nested; it's extra space is 1; 
  * \{1, 6\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{2, 4, 6\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 5\}; 
  * \{3, 4, 6\}. 



There are no more "good" subsets because, for example, subset \{6, 7\} is not big enough (we can add the 4-th matryoshka to it) or subset \{4, 6, 7\} has extra space equal to 2.

def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from the user input, where each element is converted to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the user input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the user input is empty, an empty list will be returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a callable object (function or lambda), and *dim is a sequence of positive integers representing the dimensions of the nested list to be generated.
def func_2(f):

    #The program returns a nested list where each element is the result of calling `f()` if `dim` is empty, otherwise it returns a list of length `dim[0]` where each element is the result of recursively calling `func_2(f, *dim[1:])`. The depth of the nesting matches the length of `dim`, and the size of each dimension matches the corresponding value in `dim`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a callable `f` and a sequence of positive integers `*dim`. It generates a nested list based on the dimensions specified in `*dim`. If `dim` is empty, the function returns the result of calling `f()`. Otherwise, it returns a nested list of depth equal to the length of `dim`, where each dimension's size corresponds to the values in `dim`, and each element is the result of calling `f()`. The function ensures that the nested structure is correctly formed according to the dimensions provided. If `dim` is not provided or is an empty tuple, the function simply calls `f()` and returns its result. Edge cases include handling an empty `dim` and ensuring that `f` is a valid callable. If `f` is not callable or if `dim` contains non-positive integers, the behavior is undefined and may result in errors.

It processes a sorted list `a` of tuples, each containing two integers `(ep, sp)` representing the outer and inner volumes of matryoshkas. The list `a` is expected to be non-empty and sorted based on the outer volume `ep`. The integers `ep` and `sp` satisfy the condition `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`.

    print(ans[1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the number of matryoshka dolls. It then generates a list `a` of `n` tuples, each tuple `(ep, sp)` representing the outer and inner volumes of a matryoshka doll, where `1 ≤ sp < ep ≤ 10^9`. The list `a` is sorted based on the outer volume `ep`.

The function processes this list to compute the best possible way to nest the matryoshka dolls, using a combination of sorting, binary search, and dynamic programming techniques. It maintains several data structures:
- `eps`: A list of unique outer volumes `ep` in the order they appear in `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configuration for each unique `ep`.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)` after processing.
- `er`: A list of pairs `[ep, sp]` where `ep` is unique and `sp` is the last inner volume for that `ep` in `a`.

After processing, the function uses the `er` list to determine the final nesting configuration and prints the total count of the best possible nesting configuration. The final state of the program includes:
- `a`: A sorted list of `n` tuples `(ep, sp)`.
- `eps`: A list of unique `ep` values from `a`.
- `best`: A list of pairs `(gap, count)` representing the best nesting configurations.
- `d`: A dictionary mapping each unique `ep` to its final `(gap, count)`.
- `er`: An empty list if it was non-empty initially.
- `ans`: A tuple containing the final outer volume and the total count of the best possible nesting configuration.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o and n are tuples where each tuple consists of two integers. The first element of each tuple represents a volume, and the second element represents a count. MOD is a constant integer greater than 1.
def update(o, n):
    if (n[0] < o[0]) :
        return n
        #The program returns the tuple `n`, where `n` is a tuple consisting of two integers, with the first element representing a volume that is less than the volume represented by the first element of tuple `o`. The second element of `n` represents a count.
    else :
        if (n[0] == o[0]) :
            return o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD
            #The program returns the volume o[0] and the result of (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD, where o[0] is the same as n[0], o[1] and n[1] are counts, and MOD is a constant integer greater than 1.
        else :
            return o
            #The program returns tuple `o` which consists of two integers where the first element represents a volume and the second element represents a count. The first element of `o` (volume) is less than the first element of `n` (volume), and both elements are integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `update` takes two parameters `o` and `n`, each a tuple of two integers. The first element of each tuple represents a volume, and the second element represents a count. The function returns a tuple based on the following conditions:

1. If the volume in `n` (`n[0]`) is less than the volume in `o` (`o[0]`), the function returns `n`.
2. If the volumes in `o` and `n` are equal (`n[0] == o[0]`), the function returns a new tuple with the volume `o[0]` and the count `(o[1] + n[1]) % MOD`, where `MOD` is a constant integer greater than 1.
3. If the volume in `o` is less than the volume in `n` (`o[0] < n[0]`), the function returns `o`.

The function ensures that the returned tuple maintains the volume and count constraints as described above. Edge cases such as `n[0]` being equal to `o[0]` and the behavior of the modulo operation are correctly handled.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: o and n are tuples, each containing two elements. o[0] and n[0] are integers representing the outer and inner volumes of matryoshkas, respectively, and o[1] and n[1] are integers representing counts or cumulative values.
def update2(o, n):
    if (n[0] > o[0]) :
        return n
        #The program returns tuple `n` where `n[0]` is greater than `o[0]`, and both `n[0]` and `n[1]` are integers representing the inner volume and a count or cumulative value, respectively.
    else :
        if (n[0] == o[0]) :
            return o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD
            #The program returns the integer value o[0], which represents the outer volume of the matryoshka, and (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD, where o[1] and n[1] are integers representing counts or cumulative values, and MOD is the modulus value used in the calculation. Since n[0] is equal to o[0], the first returned value is the same as n[0].
        else :
            return o
            #The program returns tuple `o`, where `o[0]` is an integer representing the outer volume of matryoshkas, `o[1]` is an integer representing counts or cumulative values, and `n[0]` (an integer representing the inner volume of matryoshkas) is less than or equal to `o[0]` but not equal to `o[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `update2` takes two tuples `o` and `n`, each containing two integers. The function compares the first elements of these tuples (`o[0]` and `n[0]`) and returns one of the following:

1. If `n[0]` is greater than `o[0]`, the function returns the tuple `n`. This means the returned tuple contains the inner volume `n[0]` and a count or cumulative value `n[1]`.

2. If `n[0]` is equal to `o[0]`, the function returns a new tuple `(o[0], (o[1] + n[1]) % MOD)`. Here, `o[0]` is the outer volume, and the second element is the sum of `o[1]` and `n[1]`, taken modulo `MOD`.

3. If `n[0]` is less than `o[0]`, the function returns the tuple `o`. This means the returned tuple contains the outer volume `o[0]` and a count or cumulative value `o[1]`.

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function assumes that `o` and `n` are always tuples of exactly two integers. If either `o` or `n` is not a tuple or does not contain exactly two integers, the function will raise an error.
- The function does not handle cases where `MOD` is not defined or is zero, which would cause a division by zero error during the modulo operation.
- The function does not validate the types or values of `o[0]`, `o[1]`, `n[0]`, and `n[1]` to ensure they are integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-integer values are passed.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
