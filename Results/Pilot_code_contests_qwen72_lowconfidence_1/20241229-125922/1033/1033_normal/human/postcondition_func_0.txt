The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. If the user input contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the user input is empty, an empty list will be returned.
