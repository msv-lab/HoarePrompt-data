Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires counting the number of triples (i, j, k) such that:
1. \( S_i \neq S_j \), \( S_i \neq S_k \), and \( S_j \neq S_k \).
2. \( j - i \neq k - j \).

However, the program seems to focus on finding specific triplets where the indices satisfy a different condition, specifically \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \), which is not aligned with the problem requirements. This means the program is counting a different set of triplets than what is required.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
RRGB
```
The correct output should be 1 because the only valid triplet (1, 2, 4) satisfies both conditions:
- \( S_1 = R \), \( S_2 = R \), \( S_4 = B \) (but since \( S_2 = R \), this triplet is invalid).
- The only valid triplet is (1, 3, 4):
  - \( S_1 = R \), \( S_3 = G \), \( S_4 = B \)
  - \( j - i = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
  - \( k - j = 4 - 3 = 1 \)
  - \( 2 \neq 1 \)

The program, however, does not correctly handle this case and may produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
