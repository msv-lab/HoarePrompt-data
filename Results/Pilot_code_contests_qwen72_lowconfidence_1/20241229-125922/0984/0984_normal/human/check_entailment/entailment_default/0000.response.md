Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of valid triplets (i, j, k) where \( S_i \neq S_j \), \( S_i \neq S_k \), and \( S_j \neq S_k \), and \( j - i \neq k - j \). However, the implementation has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The code checks for the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) using the `bisect` module, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires \( j - i \neq k - j \), but the code incorrectly tries to find indices where \( 2 \times j - i = k \).

2. **Triplets Counting Logic**: The code counts triplets where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds, which is not the same as \( j - i \neq k - j \). This means the code will count some triplets that should not be counted and miss some that should be counted.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the string might not contain all three characters (`R`, `G`, `B`). For example, if the string contains only `R` and `G`, the code will still attempt to access the `B` list, which could lead to incorrect results or exceptions.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, and therefore, it is incorrect.
