Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input string has fewer than three distinct characters. For example, if the input is:

```
3
RRR
```

The program will output `0`, which is incorrect because there are no valid triples (i, j, k) to check, but the program should output `0` only after verifying that no such triples exist according to the problem constraints. In this specific case, the program should correctly identify that there are no valid triples and output `0`. However, the current implementation does not explicitly check for this condition, leading to a potential issue in edge cases. Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3, and should be replaced with `input()`. This could cause issues when running the program in Python 3 environments.
