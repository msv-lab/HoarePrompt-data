**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Problem Description Requirements**:
   - The function needs to find the number of triples (i, j, k) such that:
     - \( S_i \neq S_j \), \( S_i \neq S_k \), and \( S_j \neq S_k \).
     - \( j - i \neq k - j \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the indices of 'R', 'G', and 'B' in the string and stores them in lists `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively.
   - The program then attempts to count the number of valid triplets (i, j, k) by checking the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) and similar conditions for other combinations of characters.

3. **Issues with the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The program only checks the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) and similar conditions for other character combinations. However, it does not check the second condition \( j - i \neq k - j \). This means that the program might count triplets that do not satisfy the second condition, leading to incorrect results.
   - **Inefficient and Incomplete Logic**: The logic used to count the triplets is inefficient and incomplete. It does not cover all possible combinations of (i, j, k) and does not correctly handle the second condition.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     RRGB
     ```
     - The correct output should be 1, as there is only one valid triplet (1, 2, 3) satisfying both conditions.
     - The program might incorrectly count more than one triplet because it does not properly enforce the second condition \( j - i \neq k - j \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly handle the second condition \( j - i \neq k - j \), leading to potential incorrect counts of valid triplets.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
