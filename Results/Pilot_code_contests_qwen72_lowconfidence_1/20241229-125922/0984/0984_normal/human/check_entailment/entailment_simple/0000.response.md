Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Condition Handling**:
   - The problem description requires finding the number of triples \((i, j, k)\) such that \(S_i \neq S_j\), \(S_i \neq S_k\), and \(S_j \neq S_k\), and \(j - i \neq k - j\).
   - The program attempts to count valid triples but does not correctly handle the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\). Instead, it seems to focus on counting triples where \(2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k\), which is not equivalent to the required condition.

2. **Triple Counting**:
   - The program uses a combination of nested loops and binary search to count valid triples, but it does not correctly account for all possible valid triples that meet the conditions \(S_i \neq S_j\), \(S_i \neq S_k\), and \(S_j \neq S_k\) and \(j - i \neq k - j\).

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The logic in the program is complex and involves multiple nested loops and binary searches, but it does not correctly implement the required conditions. Specifically, the condition \(j - i \neq k - j\) is not being checked properly.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  4
  RRGB
  ```
  - The correct output should be 1 because the only valid triplet is (0, 1, 3) which satisfies \(S_0 = R\), \(S_1 = R\), \(S_3 = B\) and \(1 - 0 \neq 3 - 1\).
  - However, the program might not correctly identify this triplet due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required conditions and logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
