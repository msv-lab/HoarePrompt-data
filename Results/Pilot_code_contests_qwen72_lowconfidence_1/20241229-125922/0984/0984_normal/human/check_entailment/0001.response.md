Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is designed to count the number of valid triples (i, j, k) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the program has a logical flaw in how it handles the second condition: \( j - i \neq k - j \). The program attempts to use binary search (via `bisect`) to find indices that do not form an equidistant triplet, but it incorrectly handles the case where the indices might still form an equidistant triplet despite the binary search results.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
5
RGBRG
```
The expected output is 3 because the valid triples are (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 4), and (0, 2, 4).

However, the program will incorrectly count some invalid triples. Specifically, it will count (0, 1, 2) as a valid triple, even though \( j - i = 1 \) and \( k - j = 1 \), which violates the second condition \( j - i \neq k - j \).

### Analysis:
- The program uses `bisect` to find the position of the third character in the sorted list of indices.
- It then checks if the index found is equal to \( 2 * l[1] - l[0] \) (which would mean the indices are equidistant).
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the index is exactly equal to \( 2 * l[1] - l[0] \). It subtracts 1 from the count in this case, but it does not ensure that no other valid triples are counted incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for checking the second condition is flawed, leading to incorrect counts for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
