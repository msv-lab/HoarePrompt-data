The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `r1` and `to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the exact new value of `z` cannot be determined. However, the new value of `z` can be expressed as `z + (r1 - to)`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (r1 - to)`, `r1` and `to` remain unchanged.**
