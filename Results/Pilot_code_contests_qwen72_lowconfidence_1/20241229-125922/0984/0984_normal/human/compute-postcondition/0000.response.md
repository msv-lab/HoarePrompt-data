The code snippet `n = int(raw_input())` reads an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the variable `S` or its properties. 

Given the initial state, `N` is an integer within the range 1 to 4000, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`.

After executing the code, the variable `n` is assigned the value of the user's input converted to an integer. The variable `S` remains unchanged.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, n is an input integer.**
