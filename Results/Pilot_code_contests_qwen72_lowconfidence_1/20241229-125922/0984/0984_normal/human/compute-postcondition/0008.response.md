The code snippet `d[i] = []` reassigns the value of `d[i]` to an empty list. This means that the entry in the dictionary `d` corresponding to the key `i` (which is the next character in the string `s`) is now an empty list.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` set to an empty list, `i` is the next character in `s`**
