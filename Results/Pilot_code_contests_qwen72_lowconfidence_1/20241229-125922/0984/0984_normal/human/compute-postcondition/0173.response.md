The code snippet:
```python
isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])
```

Impact of the code:
- `isTrue` is updated to the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted in the sublist `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`j` is `j + 1`, `r` must have at least one more element to allow the loop to continue, `l` is `[min(q[i], r[j]), max(q[i], r[j])]`, `to` is the position in the list `p` where the value `l[1]` would fit to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]`, if `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z + p1 - to - 1`, otherwise, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`, if an exception occurs, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`**
