The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, and `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`.

However, since the provided function signature does not include any parameters (`def func():`), it suggests that the parameters are likely passed in some other way (e.g., through global variables or another method not shown in the signature). For the purpose of this description, I will assume the parameters are indeed `N` and `S` as described.

Given the constraints and the lack of specific output information, I'll assume the function processes the string `S` and returns a result based on the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`. The function returns a result based on the processing of the string `S`.** 

If more specific details about the output were provided, they would be included here. However, based on the given information, this is the most accurate description of the function's functionality.
