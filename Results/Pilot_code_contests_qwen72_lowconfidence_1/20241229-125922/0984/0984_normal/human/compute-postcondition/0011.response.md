The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `d` by appending the index `i` to the list associated with the key `s[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, the first character of `s` is used as the key.

Let's denote the first character of `s` as `char`. After executing the code, `d[char]` will contain `[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list, `i` is 0, `d[s[0]]` is [0]**
