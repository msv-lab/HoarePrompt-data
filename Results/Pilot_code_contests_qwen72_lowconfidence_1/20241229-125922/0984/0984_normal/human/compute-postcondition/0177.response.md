The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `p1` and `to`. Since the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown, the output state reflects the new value of `z` as the sum of its original value and the difference between `p1` and `to`.

Output State: **`z` is `z + (p1 - to)`, `p1` and `to` are unchanged**.
