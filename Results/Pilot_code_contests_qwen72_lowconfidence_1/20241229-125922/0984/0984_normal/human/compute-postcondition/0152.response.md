The code snippet uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `l[1]` in the list `p`. The value of `to` is set to this insertion point.

- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element.
- `l` is a list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` in sorted order.

Given these conditions:

1. `l[1]` is the second element in the sorted list `l`.
2. `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `p`.

Since the exact values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `to`. However, we know that `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would fit to keep `p` sorted.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `l` is a list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` in sorted order, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
