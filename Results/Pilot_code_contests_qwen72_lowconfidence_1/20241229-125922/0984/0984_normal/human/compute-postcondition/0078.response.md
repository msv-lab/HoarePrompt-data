The provided code snippet uses the `bisect.bisect_left` function to find the insertion point for `l[1]` in the list `r`, maintaining the sorted order of `r`. This impacts the variable `to`, which will be updated to the index in `r` where `r[to] >= l[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least two elements
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`
- `l` is the sorted list of `[p[1], q[2]]`

The code snippet:
```python
to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `l`**:
   - `l` is the sorted list of `[p[1], q[2]]`.
   - Since `p` and `q` are lists of indices, `p[1]` and `q[2]` are specific indices in `s`.
   - Let's denote `p[1]` as `p1_value` and `q[2]` as `q2_value`.
   - Therefore, `l` is the sorted list of `[p1_value, q2_value]`.

2. **Find the insertion point**:
   - `to` is updated to the index in `r` where `r[to] >= l[1]`.
   - `l[1]` is the second element of the sorted list `l`.
   - The `bisect.bisect_left` function returns the index where `l[1]` should be inserted in `r` to maintain the sorted order.

### Updated Variables:
- `to` is now the index in `r` where `r[to] >= l[1]`.

### Unchanged Variables:
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G', `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least two elements, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 1, `l` is the sorted list of `[p[1], q[2]]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `r[to] >= l[1]`, `isTrue` is the position in the list `r[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit while maintaining the order, `j` is 2, `z` is incremented as described in the original state**
