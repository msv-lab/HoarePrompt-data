To solve this, let's break down the execution of the provided Python code snippet:

- The initial state indicates that `l` is a list containing two elements: the minimum and maximum of `p[i]` and `q[j]`.
- `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` (which is `l[1]`) would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`.

The code snippet:
```python
isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])
```

This line of code uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the slice of `r` starting from index `to`. This effectively finds the position where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit into the sorted portion of `r` starting from `to`.

Given the operations:
- `2 * l[1] - l[0]` calculates a new value based on the elements of `l`.
- `r[to:]` slices the list `r` starting from the index `to`.

The `isTrue` variable is assigned the index found by `bisect_left`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order.**
