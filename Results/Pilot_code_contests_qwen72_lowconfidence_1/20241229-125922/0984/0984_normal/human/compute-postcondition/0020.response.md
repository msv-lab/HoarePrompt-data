The code snippet `p1 = len(p)` calculates the length of the list `p` and assigns this length to the variable `p1`.

- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in the string `s`.
- The length of `p` is determined by the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`.

Therefore, `p1` is now equal to the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`.

The rest of the variables (`N`, `S`, `n`, `s`, `d`, `q`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s`, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`.**
