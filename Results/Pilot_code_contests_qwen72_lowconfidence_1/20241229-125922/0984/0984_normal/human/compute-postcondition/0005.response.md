To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000.
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` set to an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed one character from `s`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The variable `i` will take the value of the next character in `s` for the next iteration.
- The length of `s` remains unchanged, but the position within `s` advances by one character.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to reflect that the loop has moved to the next character in `s`.

### Updated State:
- `N` remains the same (1 ≤ N ≤ 4000).
- `S` remains the same (a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B).
- `n` remains the same (an input integer).
- `s` remains the same (a non-empty input string).
- `d` remains the same (a dictionary with `d[i]` set to an empty list).
- The variable `i` is now the next character in `s`.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` set to an empty list, `i` is the next character in `s`**
