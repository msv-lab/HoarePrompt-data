To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`
- `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`
- `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order.
- If `r[to:][isTrue]` equals `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to - 1`.
- If an exception occurs (e.g., `isTrue` is out of bounds), or if `r[to:][isTrue]` does not equal `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(q)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `q`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(q)`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - **`l`**: Since `l` is computed based on the current values of `p[i]` and `q[j]`, it will be recalculated using the new value of `j`.
   - **`to`**: This will be recomputed based on the new value of `l` (which changes with `j`).
   - **`isTrue`**: This will also be recomputed based on the new value of `l` and `to`.
   - **`z`**: The value of `z` will be updated based on the conditions described in the problem statement, but it does not change the loop condition directly.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `l` is recomputed as `[min(p[i], q[j+1]), max(p[i], q[j+1])]`.
- `to` is recomputed based on the new value of `l`.
- `isTrue` is recomputed based on the new value of `l` and `to`.
- `z` may be incremented based on the conditions described, but this does not affect the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j+1]), max(p[i], q[j+1])]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j+1])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is updated based on the conditions described**.
