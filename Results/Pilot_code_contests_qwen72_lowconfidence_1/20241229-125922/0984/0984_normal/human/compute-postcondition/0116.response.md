Output State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]` for the last iteration, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r` for the last iteration, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order for the last iteration, `j` is `len(q) - 1`, `z` is the total count of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \). If the loop does not execute, `l` remains undefined, `to` remains undefined, `isTrue` remains undefined, `j` remains `len(q) - 1`, and `z` remains 0.**
