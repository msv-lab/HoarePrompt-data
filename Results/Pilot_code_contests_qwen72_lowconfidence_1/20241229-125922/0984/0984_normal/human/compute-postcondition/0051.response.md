Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G', `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least 3 elements, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of `[p[0], q[2]]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[0], q[2])` would be inserted, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(r[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`, `j` is 2. If `r[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `r1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `r1 - to`.***
