Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`. It then processes the string to count the number of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \) for all possible pairs `(R_j, G_i)` in `p` and `q`. The function prints the total count of such valid triplets. If the string `S` does not contain any of the characters `R`, `G`, or `B`, or if the conditions for forming valid triplets are not met, the function will print `0`. **

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the string `S` is empty or does not contain any of the characters `R`, `G`, or `B`, the function will print `0`.
- The function assumes that the input string `S` consists only of the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`. If the string contains any other characters, the function may behave unpredictably or raise an error.
- The function uses the `bisect` module for efficient searching, but if the `bisect` operations fail (e.g., due to unexpected input or edge cases), the function catches exceptions and continues counting, potentially leading to incorrect counts.
- The function does not handle cases where the input integer `N` is out of the specified range (1 ≤ N ≤ 4000). If `N` is outside this range, the behavior is undefined.
