To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations have completed, we need to analyze the changes that occur in the variables during each iteration and then generalize these changes for the entire loop.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is an empty list

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for i in range(len(s)):
    d[s[i]].append(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
   - For each iteration, the loop appends the current index `i` to the list corresponding to the character `s[i]` in the dictionary `d`.

2. **State After Each Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `d[s[0]]` becomes `[0]`.
   - After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `d[s[1]]` becomes `[1]`.
   - After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `d[s[2]]` becomes `[2]`.
   - This pattern continues until the loop finishes.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, the dictionary `d` will have lists where each list contains the indices of the corresponding character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `i` will be equal to `len(s) - 1` after the last iteration, but since the loop does not modify `i` outside the loop, `i` is not relevant to the final state.

### Final Output State:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`.

### Output State:
**`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`.**
