The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `p1` and `to` to its current value. Since the initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown, the new value of `z` can be expressed as `z + (p1 - to)`. The states of `p1` and `to` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is now `z + (p1 - to)`, `p1` and `to` remain unchanged**
