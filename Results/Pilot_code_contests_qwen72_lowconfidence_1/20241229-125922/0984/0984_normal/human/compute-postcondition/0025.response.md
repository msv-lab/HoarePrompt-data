To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(len(q)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will execute if `len(q)` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is not an empty list. Let's analyze the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted.

### Given State:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`
- `z` is 0
- `i` is 0

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `len(q) > 0`.
- For `len(q) > 0`, the list `q` must contain at least one element.
- The list `q` contains the indices of 'G' in `s`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `q` is not an empty list. This means that `s` must contain at least one 'G'.
- Since `q` is derived from `s`, `s` must contain at least one 'G' for `q` to have at least one element.

### Final State:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G'
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`
- `z` is 0
- `i` is 0
