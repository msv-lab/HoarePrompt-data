The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `q1` and `to` to its current value. The specific values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, but the new value of `z` can be expressed as `z + (q1 - to)`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`, the state of other variables remains unknown**.
