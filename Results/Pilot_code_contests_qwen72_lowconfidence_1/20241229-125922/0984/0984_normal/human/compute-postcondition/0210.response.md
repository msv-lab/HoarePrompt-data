Output State: **`j` is the length of the list `r`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `l` is the sorted list `[q[i + len(r) - 1], r[len(r) - 1]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `p1` remains the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `i` is `i + len(r)`, and `z` is the total count of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \) for all possible pairs `(R_j, G_i)` in `p` and `q`.**
