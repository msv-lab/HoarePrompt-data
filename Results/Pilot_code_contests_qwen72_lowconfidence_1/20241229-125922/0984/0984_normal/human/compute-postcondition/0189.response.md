Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `l` is the sorted list `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `p1` remains the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `p[to:][isTrue]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.***
