The value of `z` is updated by adding the result of `r1 - to` to its current value. Since the initial values of `z`, `r1`, and `to` are unknown, the exact new value of `z` cannot be determined. However, the output state reflects that `z` has been updated to `z + (r1 - to)`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (r1 - to)`**
