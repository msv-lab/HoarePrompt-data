The value of `z` is updated by adding `r1 - to - 1` to its current value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order. The value at index `isTrue` in the slice `r[to:]` is equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`. `z` is `z + r1 - to - 1`.**
