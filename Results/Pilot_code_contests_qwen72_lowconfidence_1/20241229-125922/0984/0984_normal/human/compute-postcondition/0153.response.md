The code snippet provided uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the sublist `p[to:]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element.
   - `l` is a list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` in sorted order.
   - `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `p`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`
     - This line calculates the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]`.
     - It then finds the insertion point for this value in the sublist `p[to:]` using `bisect_left`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `isTrue` is assigned the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - The values of `r`, `l`, and `to` remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `l` is a list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` in sorted order, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
