To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 1 element
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `l` is `[p[0], r[1]]` sorted
- `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`
- `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`
- If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated to `z + q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(len(r)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of `len(r)`.
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(r)`.

### Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:
- The variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The variable `l` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- `l` is now `[p[0], r[2]]` sorted.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `l` is `[p[0], r[2]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated to `z + q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`. If an exception occurs, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`.**
