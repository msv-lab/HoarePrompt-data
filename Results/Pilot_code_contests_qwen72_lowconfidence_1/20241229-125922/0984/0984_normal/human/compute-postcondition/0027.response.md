To solve this, let's go through the given code step by step:

- The code snippet is: `to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`
- This line uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the position in the list `r` where `l[1]` would fit to maintain sorted order. `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000.
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G'.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`.
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element.
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element.
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`.
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`.
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1.
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`.
- `z` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `l` is a sorted list of the first elements of `p` and `q`.

### Code Execution:
- `l` is a sorted list of the first elements of `p` and `q`. Since `p` and `q` are lists of indices, `l[1]` is the second smallest index from the combined and sorted indices of 'R' and 'G' in `s`.
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, which is also sorted (since indices are naturally ordered).
- `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])` finds the insertion point for `l[1]` in `r` to keep `r` sorted. This returns the index in `r` where `l[1]` would be inserted.

### Impact:
- The variable `to` is updated with the result of `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`.

### Output State:
- `to` is the index in `r` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G', `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of the first elements of `p` and `q`, `to` is the index in `r` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`.**
