The value of `z` is incremented by the result of `r1 - to`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G', `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least two elements, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 1, `l` is the sorted list of `[p[1], q[2]]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `r[to] >= l[1]`, `isTrue` is the position in the list `r[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit while maintaining the order, `j` is 2, `z` is `z + r1 - to`**
