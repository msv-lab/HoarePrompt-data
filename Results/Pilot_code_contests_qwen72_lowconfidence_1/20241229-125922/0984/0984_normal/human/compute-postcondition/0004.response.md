The code snippet `d[i] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, this operation will create a new key `i` in the dictionary `d` and set its value to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary with `d[i]` set to an empty list**.
