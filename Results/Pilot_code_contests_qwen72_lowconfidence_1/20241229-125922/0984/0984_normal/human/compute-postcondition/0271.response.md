The value of `z` is updated by adding the result of the expression `q1 - to`. The initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, but the operation modifies `z` by the difference between `q1` and `to`. The states of `q1` and `to` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`, `q1` and `to` remain unchanged**.
