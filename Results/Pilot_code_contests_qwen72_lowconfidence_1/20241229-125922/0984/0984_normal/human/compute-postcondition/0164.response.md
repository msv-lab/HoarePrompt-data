The code snippet `isTrue = bisect.bisect_left(p[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in the slice of the list `p` starting from index `to`. The result of this operation is stored in the variable `isTrue`.

- `isTrue` is assigned the result of the `bisect_left` function.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, `r` must have at least one more element to allow the loop to continue, `l` is `[min(q[i], r[j]), max(q[i], r[j])]`, `to` is the position in the list `p` where the value `l[1]` would fit to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]`**.
