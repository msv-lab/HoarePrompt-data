Initial State: 
- `isTrue` is updated to the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` should be inserted in the sublist `p[to:]` to maintain the sorted order.
- `z` is a variable that is updated by adding the difference between `p1` and `to`.

Code Snippet:
```python
z += p1 - to
```

Impact of the code:
- `z` is incremented by the value of `p1 - to`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`isTrue` is the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]`, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`**
