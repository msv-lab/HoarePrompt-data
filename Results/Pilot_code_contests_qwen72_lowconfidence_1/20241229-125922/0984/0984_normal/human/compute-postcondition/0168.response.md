The value of `z` is updated by adding the result of `p1 - to` to its current value. The initial values of `z`, `p1`, and `to` are unknown, so the exact new value of `z` cannot be determined. However, the updated value of `z` can be expressed as `z = z + (p1 - to)`.

Output State: **`z` is updated to `z + (p1 - to)`, the state of `p1` and `to` remains unchanged.**
