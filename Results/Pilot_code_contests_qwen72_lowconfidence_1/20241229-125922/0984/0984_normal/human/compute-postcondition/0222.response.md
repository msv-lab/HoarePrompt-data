The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `q1` and `to` to its current value. Since the initial values of `z`, `q1`, and `to` are unknown, the new value of `z` can only be expressed in terms of these variables. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is now `z + q1 - to`**
