The code snippet `l = sorted([p[i], r[j]])` creates a new list `l` that contains the elements `p[i]` and `r[j]`, and sorts this list in ascending order.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 1 element
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `len(r) - 1`
- `z` is the total count of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \) for all possible pairs `(R_j, G_i)` in `p` and `q`

After executing the code snippet:
- `l` is now a list containing the elements `p[2]` and `r[len(r) - 1]`, sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 1 element, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(r) - 1`, `z` is the total count of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \) for all possible pairs `(R_j, G_i)` in `p` and `q`, `l` is `[min(p[2], r[len(r) - 1]), max(p[2], r[len(r) - 1])]`**
