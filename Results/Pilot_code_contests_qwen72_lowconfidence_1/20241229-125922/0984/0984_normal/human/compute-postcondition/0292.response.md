Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 1 element, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 2, `j` is `len(r) - 2`, `l` is `[min(p[2], r[len(r) - 2]), max(p[2], r[len(r) - 2])]`, `to` is the index in `q` where `l[1]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` fits in the sorted list `q[to:]`. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z + (q1 - to - 1)`. Otherwise, `z` is `z + (q1 - to)`.***
