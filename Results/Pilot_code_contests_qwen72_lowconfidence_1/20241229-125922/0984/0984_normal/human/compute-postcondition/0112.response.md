The value of `z` is updated by adding the difference between `r1` and `to` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted in `r[to:]` to maintain its sorted order, `j` is `j + 1`, `z` is `z + (r1 - to)`**
