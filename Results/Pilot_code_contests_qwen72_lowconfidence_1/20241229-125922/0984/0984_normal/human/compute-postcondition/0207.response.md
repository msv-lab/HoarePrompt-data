Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` with at least 3 elements, `l` is the sorted list `[q[i], r[j]]`, `to` is the index in `p` where the value `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where the value `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z_initial + 2(p1 - to) - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`.***
