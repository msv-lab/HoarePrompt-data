The code snippet provided is:
```python
to = bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: The new value of `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`.
2. **Code Impact**: The `bisect.bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the index in the list `r` where `l[1]` would fit to maintain the list in sorted order. This index is assigned to the variable `to`.
3. **Variables Affected**:
   - `to` is assigned the result of `bisect.bisect_left(r, l[1])`.
   - The value of `l` remains `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`.
   - The lists `p`, `q`, and `r` are not modified by this code snippet.

### Calculation:
- `l[1]` is the second element of the list `l`, which is `max(p[i], q[j])`.
- `to` is the index in the list `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to keep `r` sorted.

### Output State:
The output state is:
- The new value of `l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j])]`.
- `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`.

Output State: **`l` is `[min(p[i], q[j]), max(p[i], q[j)]`, `to` is the index in `r` where `max(p[i], q[j])` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `r`.**
