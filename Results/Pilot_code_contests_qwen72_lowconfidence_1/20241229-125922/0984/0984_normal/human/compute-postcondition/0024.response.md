To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000.
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a non-empty input string.
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`.
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s`.
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`.
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`.
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`.
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`.
- `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`.
- `z` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(p)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `p`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(p)` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `p` must contain at least one element (i.e., there must be at least one occurrence of 'R' in `s`).
- `i` is initialized to 0.

### Final State:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `z` is 0, `i` is 0**
