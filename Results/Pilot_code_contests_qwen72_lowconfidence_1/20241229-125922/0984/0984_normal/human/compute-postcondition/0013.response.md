The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` adds the current index `i` (which is 1) to the list associated with the key `s[1]` in the dictionary `d`.

- `i` is initially 1.
- `s[1]` is the second character of the input string `s`.
- `d[s[0]]` is initially `[0]`, meaning the first character of `s` is already mapped to the list `[0]` in the dictionary `d`.

After executing the code, the list associated with `s[1]` in the dictionary `d` will include the index 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string of at least length 2, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list, `i` is 1, `d[s[0]]` is [0], `d[s[1]]` is [1]**
