Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s`, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is `len(p) - 1`, `j` is 1, `l` is `[min(q[len(p) - 1], r[1]), max(q[len(p) - 1], r[1])]`, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would fit to maintain the order, `isTrue` is the index where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would fit in the sorted list `p[to:]`. If `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is incremented by `p1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by `p1 - to`.***
