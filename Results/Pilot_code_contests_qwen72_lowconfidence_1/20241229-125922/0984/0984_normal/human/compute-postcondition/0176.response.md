Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `r` must have at least one more element to allow the loop to continue, `l` is `[min(q[i], r[j]), max(q[i], r[j])]`, `to` is the position in the list `p` where the value `l[1]` would fit to maintain sorted order, `isTrue` is the insertion point for `2 * l[1] - l[0]` in `p[to:]`. If `p[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is `z + (p1 - to - 1)`. Otherwise, `z` is `z + (p1 - to)`.***
