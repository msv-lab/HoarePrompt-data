The code snippet `r1 = len(r)` assigns the length of the list `r` to the variable `r1`. The list `r` contains the indices of 'B' in the string `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`
- `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s`
- `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`
- `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`
- `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`
- `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s'

After executing the code:
- `r1` is assigned the value `len(r)`, which is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s`, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`**.
