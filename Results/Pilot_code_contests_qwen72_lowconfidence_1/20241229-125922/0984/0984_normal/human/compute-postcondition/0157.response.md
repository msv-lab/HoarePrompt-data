The value of `z` is incremented by the result of `p1 - to`. Since the exact value of `z` was not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the change in terms of this operation.

Output State: **`r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` that must have at least 1 element, `l` is a list containing `q[i]` and `r[j]` in sorted order, `to` is the index in `p` where `l[1]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, `isTrue` is the index in `p[to:]` where `2 * l[1] - l[0]` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order, and `p[to:][isTrue]` is not equal to `2 * l[1] - l[0]`, `z` is increased by `p1 - to`**
