Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s`, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s` and must have at least 2 elements, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s`, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is `[p[0], r[1]]` sorted, `to` is `bisect.bisect_left(q, l[1])`, `isTrue` is `bisect.bisect_left(q[to:], 2 * l[1] - l[0])`. If `q[to:][isTrue] == 2 * l[1] - l[0]`, then `z` is updated to `z + q1 - to - 1`. Otherwise, `z` is updated to `z + (q1 - to)`.***
