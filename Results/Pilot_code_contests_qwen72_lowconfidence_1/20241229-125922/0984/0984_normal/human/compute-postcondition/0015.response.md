The code `d[s[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the list associated with the key `s[2]` in the dictionary `d`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000
- `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is a non-empty input string of at least length 2
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list
- `i` is 2
- `d[s[0]]` is [0]
- `d[s[1]]` is [1]

After executing the code:
- The value of `i` remains 2
- The list `d[s[2]]` now includes the value 2

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string of at least length 2, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list, `i` is 2, `d[s[0]]` is [0], `d[s[1]]` is [1], `d[s[2]]` is [2]**
