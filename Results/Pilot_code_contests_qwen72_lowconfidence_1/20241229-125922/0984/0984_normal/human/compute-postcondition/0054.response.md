Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters R, G, and B, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string that must contain at least one 'G', `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is a list containing the indices of the corresponding character in `s`, `p` is a list containing the indices of 'R' in `s` and must have at least one element, `q` is a list of indices of 'G' in `s` and must have at least one element, `r` is a list of indices of 'B' in `s`, `p1` is the number of occurrences of 'R' in `s`, `q1` is the number of occurrences of 'G' in `s` and must be at least 1, `r1` is the number of occurrences of 'B' in `s`, `z` is the count of valid triplets (R, G, B) where the condition \( 2 \times G_i - R_j = B_k \) holds for some \( k \geq \text{to} \), `i` is 0, `l` is not defined after the loop, `to` is not defined after the loop, `isTrue` is not defined after the loop, `j` is the last index of the loop which is `len(q) - 1`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., `q` is empty), `z` remains 0.**
