def func_1(d):

        return ordd - ord0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character `d`, which can be either a digit ('0'-'9') or an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z'). If `d` is a digit, the function returns an integer from 0 to 9, representing the numerical value of the digit. If `d` is an uppercase letter, the function returns an integer between 10 and 35, inclusive, corresponding to the position of the letter in the alphabet (with 'A' being 10, 'B' being 11, etc.). The function does not handle any other characters, and any input outside the specified range ('0'-'9' or 'A'-'Z') will result in undefined behavior.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ds` representing the hours or minutes part of the Martian time, consisting of numbers and/or uppercase Latin letters. It converts each character in `ds` using a function `conv` and filters out any resulting `False` values from the beginning of the list. The function returns either an empty list or a list where the first element is not `False`. If the `doprint` variable is set to `True`, the function prints the list during the filtering process. Potential edge cases include an empty input string, which would result in an empty list being returned, and the possibility of `conv` returning `False` for all characters, which would also result in an empty list.

The function returns `[lo, hi - 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `ds`, a list of integers representing the digits of a time component in the Martian numeral system, and `ub`, a non-negative integer representing the upper bound for the value of the time component. The function performs the following actions:

1. If the list `ds` is empty, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
2. It calculates `maxds`, the maximum value in `ds`. If `maxds` exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
3. If `ds` contains only one digit, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function converts the digits in `ds` into a single value using a base `lo` (where `lo` is `maxds + 1`). If this value (`summ`) exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
5. If `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, the function enters a loop where it increments `hi` starting from `lo` and recalculates `summ` using the new base `hi`. The loop continues until `summ` exceeds `ub`. The function then returns `[lo, hi - 1]`.

Edge Cases:
- If `ds` is an empty list, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
- If `ds` contains a single digit, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
- If the maximum digit in `ds` exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
- If the initial conversion of `ds` using base `lo` results in a value greater than `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.

Potential Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that `ds` is a list of integers and does not handle cases where `ds` contains non-integer values or is not a list.
- The function does not handle cases where `ub` is negative, although the annotations suggest it should be non-negative.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` processes a time string in the format "HH:MM" to determine valid radix values for the hour and minute components. It reads the input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into hour and minute parts, and processes these parts using the `processds` function. The processed values are then used to determine the valid radix ranges for hours and minutes using the `func_3` function. The function returns different values based on the results of `func_3`:

1. If either the hour or minute processing results in an invalid range (i.e., `hminmax[0] == 0` or `mminmax[0] == 0`), the function returns `[0]`.
2. If both the hour and minute processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1` and `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns `[-1]`.
3. If only the hour processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid minute radices from `mminmax[0]` to `mminmax[1] + 1`.
4. If only the minute processing results in an error (i.e., `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid hour radices from `hminmax[0]` to `hminmax[1] + 1`.
5. If the valid hour radix range is completely greater than the valid minute radix range (i.e., `hminmax[0] > mminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
6. If the valid minute radix range is completely greater than the valid hour radix range (i.e., `mminmax[0] > hminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
7. Otherwise, the function returns a range of valid radices from the maximum of `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` to the minimum of `hminmax[1]` and `mminmax[1]` inclusive.

Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format "HH:MM". If the input is not in this format, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where `doprint` is not defined or is set to a non-boolean value.
- The function does not validate the input values of `hs` and `ms` to ensure they are within the expected range (2 to 36). If `processds` returns values outside this range, the behavior of `func_3` and subsequently `func_4` is undefined.
