Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Character Conversion (`func_1`)**:
   - Converts characters to their numerical equivalents correctly, handling both digits and uppercase letters as specified in the problem description.

2. **Leading Zero Removal (`func_2`)**:
   - Removes leading zeros from the input strings, ensuring that the time components are processed correctly without affecting the result.

3. **Radix Range Calculation (`func_3`)**:
   - Determines the valid radix range for a given time component (hours or minutes) based on the constraints provided (hours ≤ 23, minutes ≤ 59).
   - Handles edge cases such as empty lists, single-digit inputs, and cases where the maximum digit exceeds the upper bound.

4. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - Processes the input time string, splitting it into hours and minutes.
   - Calls `func_3` to determine the valid radix ranges for both hours and minutes.
   - Combines the results to determine the final valid radix range, handling all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Verification of Examples:
- **Example 1: "11:20"**
  - The valid radixes are 3 through 22, which matches the output of the program.

- **Example 2: "2A:13"**
  - The time "2A:13" cannot be a valid time in any radix, so the program correctly outputs 0.

- **Example 3: "000B:00001"**
  - The time "000B:00001" can be a valid time in infinitely many radixes, so the program correctly outputs -1.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- **Empty Input**: The program correctly handles empty input by returning 0.
- **Single Digit Input**: The program correctly handles single-digit inputs by returning 0.
- **Invalid Time Components**: The program correctly handles cases where the time components exceed the allowed limits (hours > 23, minutes > 59) by returning 0.
- **Infinite Radixes**: The program correctly identifies when the time can be valid in infinitely many radixes and returns -1.

Given that the code handles all the edge cases and examples correctly, and follows the problem description for every potential case, the program is correct.
