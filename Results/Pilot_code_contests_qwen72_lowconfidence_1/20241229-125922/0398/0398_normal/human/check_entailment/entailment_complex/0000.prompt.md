You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Having stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. "What ungentlemanly behavior!" â€” you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. 

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called "R2:D2". What can "R2:D2" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as "a:b", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.

Your task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time "a:b".

Input

The first line contains a single string as "a:b" (without the quotes). There a is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String a shows the number of hours. String b is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String b shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings a and b are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings a and b can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string "008:1" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).

We consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.

Output

Print the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time "a:b", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b", print the single integer -1.

Note that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.

Examples

Input

11:20


Output

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

Input

2A:13


Output

0


Input

000B:00001


Output

-1

Note

Let's consider the first sample. String "11:20" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. 

Let's consider the second sample test. String "2A:13" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.

Let's consider the third sample. String "000B:00001" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.

    #The program returns a value between 10 and 35, inclusive, depending on the specific uppercase letter `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single character `d`, which can be either a digit ('0'-'9') or an uppercase letter ('A'-'Z'). If `d` is a digit, the function returns an integer from 0 to 9, representing the numerical value of the digit. If `d` is an uppercase letter, the function returns an integer between 10 and 35, inclusive, corresponding to the position of the letter in the alphabet (with 'A' being 10, 'B' being 11, etc.). The function does not handle any other characters, and any input outside the specified range ('0'-'9' or 'A'-'Z') will result in undefined behavior.

    #The program returns `rtn`, which is either an empty list or a list where the first element is not `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ds` representing the hours or minutes part of the Martian time, consisting of numbers and/or uppercase Latin letters. It converts each character in `ds` using a function `conv` and filters out any resulting `False` values from the beginning of the list. The function returns either an empty list or a list where the first element is not `False`. If the `doprint` variable is set to `True`, the function prints the list during the filtering process. Potential edge cases include an empty input string, which would result in an empty list being returned, and the possibility of `conv` returning `False` for all characters, which would also result in an empty list.

The function returns `[lo, hi - 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `ds`, a list of integers representing the digits of a time component in the Martian numeral system, and `ub`, a non-negative integer representing the upper bound for the value of the time component. The function performs the following actions:

1. If the list `ds` is empty, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
2. It calculates `maxds`, the maximum value in `ds`. If `maxds` exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
3. If `ds` contains only one digit, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the function converts the digits in `ds` into a single value using a base `lo` (where `lo` is `maxds + 1`). If this value (`summ`) exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
5. If `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, the function enters a loop where it increments `hi` starting from `lo` and recalculates `summ` using the new base `hi`. The loop continues until `summ` exceeds `ub`. The function then returns `[lo, hi - 1]`.

Edge Cases:
- If `ds` is an empty list, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
- If `ds` contains a single digit, the function returns `[-1, -1]`.
- If the maximum digit in `ds` exceeds `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.
- If the initial conversion of `ds` using base `lo` results in a value greater than `ub`, the function returns `[0, 0]`.

Potential Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that `ds` is a list of integers and does not handle cases where `ds` contains non-integer values or is not a list.
- The function does not handle cases where `ub` is negative, although the annotations suggest it should be non-negative.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` processes a time string in the format "HH:MM" to determine valid radix values for the hour and minute components. It reads the input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into hour and minute parts, and processes these parts using the `processds` function. The processed values are then used to determine the valid radix ranges for hours and minutes using the `func_3` function. The function returns different values based on the results of `func_3`:

1. If either the hour or minute processing results in an invalid range (i.e., `hminmax[0] == 0` or `mminmax[0] == 0`), the function returns `[0]`.
2. If both the hour and minute processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1` and `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns `[-1]`.
3. If only the hour processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid minute radices from `mminmax[0]` to `mminmax[1] + 1`.
4. If only the minute processing results in an error (i.e., `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid hour radices from `hminmax[0]` to `hminmax[1] + 1`.
5. If the valid hour radix range is completely greater than the valid minute radix range (i.e., `hminmax[0] > mminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
6. If the valid minute radix range is completely greater than the valid hour radix range (i.e., `mminmax[0] > hminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
7. Otherwise, the function returns a range of valid radices from the maximum of `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` to the minimum of `hminmax[1]` and `mminmax[1]` inclusive.

Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format "HH:MM". If the input is not in this format, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where `doprint` is not defined or is set to a non-boolean value.
- The function does not validate the input values of `hs` and `ms` to ensure they are within the expected range (2 to 36). If `processds` returns values outside this range, the behavior of `func_3` and subsequently `func_4` is undefined.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
