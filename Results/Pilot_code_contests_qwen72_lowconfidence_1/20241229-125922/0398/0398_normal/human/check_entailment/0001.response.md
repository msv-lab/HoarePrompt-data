Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of characters to their numerical values correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` uses variables `ord9`, `ord0`, and `ordA` which are not defined in the code. This will cause the program to raise a `NameError` when it tries to execute these lines. As a result, the program will fail to run for any input, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
