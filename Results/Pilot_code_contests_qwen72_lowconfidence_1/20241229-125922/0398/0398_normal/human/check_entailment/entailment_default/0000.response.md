Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_4` assumes that the input is always in the correct format "HH:MM" and does not handle cases where the input is not in this format. Additionally, the function `func_3` does not handle cases where the input list `ds` contains non-integer values or is not a list, and it does not handle cases where `ub` is negative, although the annotations suggest it should be non-negative. These issues can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the specification for every potential case.
