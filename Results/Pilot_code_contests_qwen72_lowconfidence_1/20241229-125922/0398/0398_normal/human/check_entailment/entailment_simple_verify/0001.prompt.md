You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Having stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. "What ungentlemanly behavior!" â€” you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. 

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called "R2:D2". What can "R2:D2" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as "a:b", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.

Your task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time "a:b".

Input

The first line contains a single string as "a:b" (without the quotes). There a is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String a shows the number of hours. String b is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String b shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings a and b are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings a and b can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string "008:1" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).

We consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.

Output

Print the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time "a:b", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b", print the single integer -1.

Note that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.

Examples

Input

11:20


Output

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

Input

2A:13


Output

0


Input

000B:00001


Output

-1

Note

Let's consider the first sample. String "11:20" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. 

Let's consider the second sample test. String "2A:13" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.

Let's consider the third sample. String "000B:00001" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of characters to their numerical values correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` uses variables `ord9`, `ord0`, and `ordA` which are not defined in the code. This will cause the program to raise a `NameError` when it tries to execute these lines. As a result, the program will fail to run for any input, making it incorrect according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
