Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program was incorrect due to the undefined variables `ord9`, `ord0`, and `ordA` in the `func_1` function. However, the annotated version of the code includes the definitions for these variables at the beginning of the script:

```python
ord9 = ord('9')
ord0 = ord('0')
ordA = ord('A')
```

With these definitions, the program should now correctly convert characters to their numerical values. The rest of the functions and logic in the program seem to align with the problem description, as the annotations detail the expected behavior and state transitions at various points in the program.

The annotations confirm that:
1. `func_1` correctly converts characters to their numerical values.
2. `func_2` processes the input strings correctly by removing leading zeros and converting characters to integers.
3. `func_3` determines the valid range of radixes for a given time component (hours or minutes).
4. `func_4` integrates the above functions to process the input, validate the time components, and return the appropriate range of radixes.

Given that the program now includes the necessary variable definitions and the annotated version confirms the correct behavior at each step, the program appears to meet the problem description and should be considered correct. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is correct.
