You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Having stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. "What ungentlemanly behavior!" â€” you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. 

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called "R2:D2". What can "R2:D2" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as "a:b", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.

Your task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time "a:b".

Input

The first line contains a single string as "a:b" (without the quotes). There a is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String a shows the number of hours. String b is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String b shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings a and b are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings a and b can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string "008:1" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).

We consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.

Output

Print the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time "a:b", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b", print the single integer -1.

Note that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.

Examples

Input

11:20


Output

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

Input

2A:13


Output

0


Input

000B:00001


Output

-1

Note

Let's consider the first sample. String "11:20" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. 

Let's consider the second sample test. String "2A:13" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.

Let's consider the third sample. String "000B:00001" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has several issues that prevent it from fully adhering to the problem description:

1. **Undefined Variables**: The variables `ord9`, `ord0`, `ordA`, and `doprint` are used but not defined anywhere in the code. This will cause runtime errors.

2. **Incorrect Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to convert a character to its numerical value, but it uses undefined variables (`ord9`, `ord0`, `ordA`).
   - `func_2` is supposed to process a list of characters, but it calls an undefined function `conv`.
   - `func_3` processes a list of digits and an upper bound, but it uses undefined variables (`doprint`) and has logical issues.
   - `func_4` reads input and processes it, but it relies on undefined functions and variables.

3. **Logical Issues**:
   - The function `func_4` does not handle the conversion of the input strings to their numerical values correctly.
   - The logic for determining the valid radixes is flawed, especially in how it handles the upper bounds for hours and minutes.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as leading zeros correctly.
   - It does not handle cases where the input is invalid or does not represent a valid time in any numeral system.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` processes a time string in the format "HH:MM" to determine valid radix values for the hour and minute components. It reads the input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into hour and minute parts, and processes these parts using the `processds` function. The processed values are then used to determine the valid radix ranges for hours and minutes using the `func_3` function. The function returns different values based on the results of `func_3`:

1. If either the hour or minute processing results in an invalid range (i.e., `hminmax[0] == 0` or `mminmax[0] == 0`), the function returns `[0]`.
2. If both the hour and minute processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1` and `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns `[-1]`.
3. If only the hour processing results in an error (i.e., `hminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid minute radices from `mminmax[0]` to `mminmax[1] + 1`.
4. If only the minute processing results in an error (i.e., `mminmax[0] == -1`), the function returns a range of valid hour radices from `hminmax[0]` to `hminmax[1] + 1`.
5. If the valid hour radix range is completely greater than the valid minute radix range (i.e., `hminmax[0] > mminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
6. If the valid minute radix range is completely greater than the valid hour radix range (i.e., `mminmax[0] > hminmax[1]`), the function returns `[0]`.
7. Otherwise, the function returns a range of valid radices from the maximum of `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` to the minimum of `hminmax[1]` and `mminmax[1]` inclusive.

Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The function assumes that the input is always in the correct format "HH:MM". If the input is not in this format, the behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where `doprint` is not defined or is set to a non-boolean value.
- The function does not validate the input values of `hs` and `ms` to ensure they are within the expected range (2 to 36). If `processds` returns values outside this range, the behavior of `func_3` and subsequently `func_4` is undefined.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
