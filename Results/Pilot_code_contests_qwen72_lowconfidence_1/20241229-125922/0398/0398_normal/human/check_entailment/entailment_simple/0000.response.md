Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly follows the problem description by performing the following steps:

1. **Character Conversion (`func_1`)**: This function converts each character in the input strings (hours and minutes) into their corresponding numerical values. Digits '0'-'9' are converted to their integer values, and uppercase letters 'A'-'Z' are converted to 10-35. This step ensures that the input is interpreted correctly according to the problem's rules.

2. **Leading Zero Removal (`func_2`)**: This function removes leading zeros from the input strings. This is important because leading zeros do not affect the value of the time but can influence the interpretation of the numeral system. The function also converts the string into a list of integers, which is used in the next steps.

3. **Range Calculation (`func_3`)**: This function determines the possible radixes for a given time component (hours or minutes). It checks if the time component can be represented within the bounds of 23 for hours and 59 for minutes. If the time component cannot be represented within these bounds in any radix, it returns [0, 0]. If the time component can be represented in infinitely many radices, it returns [-1, -1]. Otherwise, it returns the range of valid radices.

4. **Combining Results (`func_4`)**: This function processes the input time string, splits it into hours and minutes, and applies `func_3` to both components. It then combines the results to determine the valid radices for the entire time. The function handles cases where one or both components can be represented in infinitely many radices, or where there are no valid radices.

The program correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description:
- **No valid radix**: If neither the hours nor the minutes can be represented in any radix, the program returns [0].
- **Infinitely many valid radices**: If both the hours and minutes can be represented in infinitely many radices, the program returns [-1].
- **Valid radices**: The program correctly calculates and returns the range of valid radices for the time.

Given the problem constraints and the program's logic, the program meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
