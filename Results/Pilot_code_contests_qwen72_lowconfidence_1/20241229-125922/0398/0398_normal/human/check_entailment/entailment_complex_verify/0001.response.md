Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect due to the undefined variables `ord9`, `ord0`, and `ordA` in the `func_1` function. However, the annotated version of the code includes the definitions of these variables at the beginning of the script:

```python
ord9 = ord('9')
ord0 = ord('0')
ordA = ord('A')
```

This means that the variables are indeed defined before they are used in `func_1`, and the program will not raise a `NameError` when executing these lines.

Given this, the program now appears to handle the conversion of characters to their numerical values correctly. The rest of the program logic, as described in the annotations, aligns with the problem description and handles the various edge cases appropriately. The functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are designed to process the input, determine the valid radix ranges for hours and minutes, and return the appropriate results based on the problem requirements.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the program is correct, and the original assessment is not accurate.
