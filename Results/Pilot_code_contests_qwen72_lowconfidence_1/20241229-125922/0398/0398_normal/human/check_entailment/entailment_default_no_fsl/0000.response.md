Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code provided does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, there is an issue with the handling of the `processds` function, which is not defined in the provided code. This function is crucial for converting the hour and minute parts of the input into a list of integers that can be processed by `func_3`. Without a proper definition of `processds`, the behavior of the program is undefined and it will likely fail to produce the correct output for many inputs.

Additionally, the function `func_2` uses a `conv` function, which is also not defined in the provided code. This means that the conversion of characters to their numerical values is not properly handled, leading to potential issues in the subsequent steps of the program.

Here is a specific example where the program will fail due to the missing `processds` and `conv` functions:

### Example Input:
```
11:20
```

### Expected Output:
```
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22
```

### Actual Behavior:
Since `processds` and `conv` are not defined, the program will raise an exception when it tries to call these functions, leading to an incorrect or incomplete output.

To be considered correct, the program needs to define the `processds` and `conv` functions and ensure that they handle the conversion of characters to numerical values correctly. Once these functions are properly defined, the program should be re-evaluated to ensure it meets all the requirements of the problem description.
