Postcondition: ***`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`. If `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `False`) has been printed.***
