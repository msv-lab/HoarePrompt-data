The code assigns the result of `func_3(ms, 59)` to the variable `mminmax`. Since the function `func_3` is applied to `ms` with the parameter `59`, this operation does not affect the values of `hs`, `ms`, or `hminmax`. The only change is the assignment of the result of `func_3(ms, 59)` to `mminmax`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`hs` and `ms` are tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36. `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)`. `mminmax` is the result of `func_3(ms, 59)`. If `doprint` is True, the values of `hs` and `ms` remain unchanged. `hminmax[0]` is not equal to 0.**
