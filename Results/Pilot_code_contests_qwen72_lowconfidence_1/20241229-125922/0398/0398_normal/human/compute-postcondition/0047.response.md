The code snippet sets `summ` to 0. This changes the value of `summ` from its previous value (which was the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi - 1`) to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, `summ` is 0, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.**
