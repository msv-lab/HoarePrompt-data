`summ` is updated to the value of `summ * hi + d`. Given that `summ` was initially the first element of `ds`, and `d` is the second element of `ds`, and `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the new value of `summ` is `(first element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (second element of ds)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed, `summ` is `(first element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (second element of ds)`, if `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, `d` is the second element of `ds`**
