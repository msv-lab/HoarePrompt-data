Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi` (i.e., `summ = d_0 * hi^(n-1) + d_1 * hi^(n-2) + ... + d_(n-2) * hi^1 + d_(n-1)` where `d_i` are the elements of `ds` and `n` is the length of `ds`). If `ds` is an empty list, `summ` remains 0.**
