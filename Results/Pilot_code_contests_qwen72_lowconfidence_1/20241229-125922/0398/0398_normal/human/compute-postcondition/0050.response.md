To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- The tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed.
- `summ` is `d`.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for d in ds:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `ds`**: The loop iterates over each element `d` in the list `ds`. After the previous iteration, the next element in `ds` will be the new value of `d`.
2. **Variable `summ`**: `summ` is set to the current value of `d` in each iteration. Since `d` changes to the next element in `ds`, `summ` will also change accordingly.
3. **Other Variables**: The variables `ub`, `doprint`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, and the printed tuple remain unchanged between iterations.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- The next element in `ds` will be assigned to `d`.
- `summ` will be updated to the new value of `d`.
- The other variables (`ub`, `doprint`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, and the printed tuple) remain the same.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- The tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed.
- `d` is the next element in `ds`.
- `summ` is the next element in `ds`.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `d` is the next element in `ds`, `summ` is the next element in `ds`, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**
