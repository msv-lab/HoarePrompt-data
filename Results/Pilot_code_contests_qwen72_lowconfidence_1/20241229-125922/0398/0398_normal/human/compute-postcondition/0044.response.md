Postcondition: ***`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi`. If `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed. Additionally, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.***
