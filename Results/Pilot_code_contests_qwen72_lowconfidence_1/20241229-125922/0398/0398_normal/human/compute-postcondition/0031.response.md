The code snippet sets the variable `summ` to 0. This changes the value of `summ` from its previous value (which was the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `lo`) to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `d` is the last element in `ds`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, if `doprint` is true, the tuple ('A', `lo`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed, and `summ` is 0**.
