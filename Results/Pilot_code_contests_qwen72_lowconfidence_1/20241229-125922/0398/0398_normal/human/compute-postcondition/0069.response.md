The value of `summ` is updated by multiplying its current value by `hi` and adding the value of `d`. Given that `hi` is `maxds + 4` and `d` is the third element of `ds`, the new value of `summ` is `(first element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (second element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (third element of ds)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed, `summ` is `(first element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (second element of ds) * (maxds + 4) + (third element of ds)`, if `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed, `d` is the third element of `ds`**
