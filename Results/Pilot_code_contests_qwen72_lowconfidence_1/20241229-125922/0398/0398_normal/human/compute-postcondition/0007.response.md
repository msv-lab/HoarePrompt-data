Postcondition: ***`hs` and `ms` are tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36. `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)`. If `doprint` is True, the values of `hs` and `ms` remain unchanged. Additionally, `hminmax[0]` is not equal to 0.***
