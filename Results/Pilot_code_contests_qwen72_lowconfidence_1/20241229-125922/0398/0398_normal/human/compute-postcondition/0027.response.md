Output State: **The program returns a range from the maximum of `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` to the minimum of `hminmax[1]` and `mminmax[1]` inclusive, where `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)` and `mminmax` is the result of `func_3(ms, 59)`. Both `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` are not equal to 0 or -1, and `hminmax[0]` is less than or equal to `mminmax[1]`, and `mminmax[0]` is less than or equal to `hminmax[1]`.**
