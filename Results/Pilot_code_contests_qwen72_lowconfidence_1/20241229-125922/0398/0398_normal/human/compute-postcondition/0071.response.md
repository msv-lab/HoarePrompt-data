Postcondition: ***`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed, `summ` is the sum of each element of `ds` multiplied by `hi` raised to the power of its index in reverse order, if `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`. Additionally, `doprint` is true, and the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed.***
