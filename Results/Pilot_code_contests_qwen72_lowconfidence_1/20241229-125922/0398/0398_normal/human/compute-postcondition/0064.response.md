To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for d in ds:` will execute if `ds` is a non-empty list.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `ub` is a non-negative integer.
   - `doprint` is true.
   - `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
   - `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
   - `hi` is `maxds + 4`.
   - The tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed.
   - `summ` is 0.
   - If `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed.
   - `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

Given these conditions, the loop will execute if `ds` has at least one element. Since `ds` is already stated to have at least 2 elements, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute based on the length of `ds`.

However, we need to ensure that the initial state reflects the correct values and conditions for the first iteration of the loop. Specifically, we need to set the initial value of `d` to the first element of `ds`.

### Adjusted State:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 4`.
- The tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed.
- `summ` is 0.
- If `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.
- `d` is the first element of `ds`.

### Final State:
State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed, `summ` is 0, if `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, `d` is the first element of `ds`**.
