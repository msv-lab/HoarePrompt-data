The code snippet `summ = summ * hi + d` modifies the value of `summ`. Given that `summ` was initially 0, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, and `d` is an element from the list `ds`, the new value of `summ` will be `0 * (maxds + 3) + d`, which simplifies to `d`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `ub` is a non-negative integer
- `doprint` is true
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`
- The tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed
- `summ` is now `d`
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is `d`, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**
