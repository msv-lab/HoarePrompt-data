Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is the smallest integer such that the sum of each element of `ds` multiplied by `hi` raised to the power of its index in reverse order is greater than `ub`, `summ` is this sum, and the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, `previous_summ`, `ub`, `False`) has been printed for each iteration until `hi` reaches its final value. The function returns `[lo, hi - 1]`.**
