Postcondition: ***`hs` and `ms` are tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36. `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)`. `mminmax` is the result of `func_3(ms, 59)`. If `doprint` is True, the values of `hs` and `ms` remain unchanged. `hminmax[0]` is not equal to 0. `mminmax[0]` is not equal to 0. `hminmax[0]` is not equal to -1 or `mminmax[0]` is not equal to -1. `hminmax[0]` is not equal to -1. `mminmax[0]` is not equal to -1. Additionally, `hminmax[0]` is greater than `mminmax[1]`.***
