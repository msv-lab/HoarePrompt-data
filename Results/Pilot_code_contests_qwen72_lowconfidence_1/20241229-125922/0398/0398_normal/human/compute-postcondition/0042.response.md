Postcondition: ***`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi`. The tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `true`) has been printed, and `summ` is greater than `ub`.***
