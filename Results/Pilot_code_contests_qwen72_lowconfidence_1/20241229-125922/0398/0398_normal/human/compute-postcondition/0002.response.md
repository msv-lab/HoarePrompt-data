The code prints the tuples `hs` and `ms`. Since the `print` function does not modify any variables, the values of `hs`, `ms`, and `doprint` remain unchanged. The output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`hs` and `ms` are tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36, and `doprint` is True**
