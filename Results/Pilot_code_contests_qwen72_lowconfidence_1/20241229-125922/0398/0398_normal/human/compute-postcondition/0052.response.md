To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the current state and the conditions required for the loop to continue:

1. **`ds`**: The list `ds` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `ds` must have at least 3 elements.
2. **`d`**: `d` is the next element in `ds`. After the previous iteration, `d` was the second element in `ds`. For the next iteration, `d` will be the third element in `ds`.
3. **`summ`**: `summ` is calculated as `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`. Since `d` is now the third element in `ds`, `summ` will be updated using this new value of `d`.
4. **`ub`**: `ub` remains a non-negative integer and does not change.
5. **`maxds`**: `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds` and does not change unless a new element in `ds` is larger than the current `maxds`.
6. **`lo` and `hi`**: These values are derived from `maxds` and do not change unless `maxds` changes.
7. **`doprint`**: This boolean flag remains `true`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following adjustments:

- `ds` must have at least 3 elements.
- `d` is the third element in `ds`.
- `summ` is updated to `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`, where `d` is the third element in `ds`.
- All other variables (`ub`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, `doprint`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `d` is the third element in `ds`, `summ` is `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**
