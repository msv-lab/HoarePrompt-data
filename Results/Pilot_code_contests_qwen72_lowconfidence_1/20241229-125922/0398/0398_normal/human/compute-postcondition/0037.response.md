The value of `summ` is updated to `summ * hi + d`. Given the initial conditions:

- `summ` was previously calculated as `summ * (maxds + 2) + d`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 2`.
- `d` is the third element in `ds`.

Thus, the new value of `summ` is `summ * (maxds + 2) + d`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `d` is the third element in `ds`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is `summ * (maxds + 2) + d`**
