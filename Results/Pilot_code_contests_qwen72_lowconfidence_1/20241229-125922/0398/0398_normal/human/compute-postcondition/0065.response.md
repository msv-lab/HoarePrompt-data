The code `summ = summ * hi + d` modifies the value of `summ`. To determine the new value of `summ`, we need to consider its initial value, the value of `hi`, and the value of `d`.

- `summ` starts as 0.
- `hi` is `maxds + 4`.
- `d` is the first element of `ds`.

The new value of `summ` is calculated as follows:
- `summ = 0 * (maxds + 4) + d = d`.

Since `d` is the first element of `ds`, the new value of `summ` is the first element of `ds`.

All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple `('B', hi - 2, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has been printed, `summ` is the first element of `ds`, if `doprint` is true, the tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, False)` has been printed, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, `d` is the first element of `ds`**
