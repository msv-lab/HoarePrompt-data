The provided Python code snippet performs a print operation with several variables and expressions. Here's the breakdown:

- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 2`.
- `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi`.

The code snippet prints a tuple containing:
- The string 'B'
- The value of `hi`
- The value of `summ`
- The value of `ub`
- The result of the comparison `summ > ub` (which will be either `True` or `False`)

Since the `print` function does not modify any variables, the values of `ds`, `ub`, `doprint`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, and `summ` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi`, and the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed.**
