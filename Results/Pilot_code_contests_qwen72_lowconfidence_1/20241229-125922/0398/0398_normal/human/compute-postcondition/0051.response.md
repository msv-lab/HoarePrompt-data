The code `summ = summ * hi + d` updates the value of `summ`. We know from the initial state that:

- `hi` is `maxds + 3`
- `d` is the next element in `ds`
- `summ` is the next element in `ds` and is less than or equal to `ub`

Therefore, the new value of `summ` is calculated as `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`.

All other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `d` is the next element in `ds`, `summ` is `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**
