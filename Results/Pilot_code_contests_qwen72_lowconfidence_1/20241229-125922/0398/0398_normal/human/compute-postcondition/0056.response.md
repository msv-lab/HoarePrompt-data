The given code snippet prints a tuple with the following elements: `'B'`, `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, and the result of the comparison `summ > ub`.

Given the initial state:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- The tuple `('B', hi - 1, 0, ub, 0 > ub)` has already been printed.
- `summ` is calculated as `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.
- `doprint` is currently true.

The code snippet:
```python
print(('B', hi, summ, ub, summ > ub))
```

The output state remains the same for all variables except that the tuple `('B', hi, summ, ub, summ > ub)` is printed. Since `summ <= ub`, the last element of the tuple will be `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`. Additionally, the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `False`) has been printed.**
