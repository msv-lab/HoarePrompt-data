Since the `while` loop condition is `True`, the loop will always execute another iteration unless there is an explicit break or return statement within the loop body. Given the information provided, no specific conditions are mentioned that would prevent the loop from executing again. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`. If `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `False`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.**
