You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: hs and ms are tuples containing the minimum and maximum possible radix values for the hour and minute strings respectively, such that hminmax and mminmax are tuples of integers with the format (min_radix, max_radix) where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36.
```
def func_4():
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns a list containing a single element, which is 0.

Case_2: The program returns a list containing the integer 0.

Case_3: The program returns the list `[-1]`.

Case_4: The program returns a range from `mminmax[0]` to `mminmax[1] + 1`, where `mminmax` is the result of `func_3(ms, 59)`, and `mminmax[0]` is not equal to 0, and `mminmax[0]` is not equal to -1.

Case_5: The program returns a range from `hminmax[0]` (which is not equal to 0 or -1) to `hminmax[1] + 1`, where `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)`.

Case_6: The program returns a list containing the integer 0.

Case_7: The program returns a list containing the integer 0.

Case_8: The program returns a range from the maximum of `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` to the minimum of `hminmax[1]` and `mminmax[1]` inclusive, where `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)` and `mminmax` is the result of `func_3(ms, 59)`. Both `hminmax[0]` and `mminmax[0]` are not equal to 0 or -1, and `hminmax[0]` is less than or equal to `mminmax[1]`, and `mminmax[0]` is less than or equal to `hminmax[1]`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
