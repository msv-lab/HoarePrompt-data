To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- `summ` is 0.
- The tuple (`'B'`, `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for d in ds:
    summ = summ * hi + d
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `summ` starts at 0.
   - `hi` is `maxds + 3`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `d` in `ds`, `summ` is updated as `summ = summ * hi + d`.
   - This means `summ` is being transformed into a polynomial form where each element of `ds` is weighted by powers of `hi`.

3. **After All Iterations**:
   - Let `ds` be `[d1, d2, ..., dn]`.
   - After the first iteration: `summ = d1`.
   - After the second iteration: `summ = (d1 * hi) + d2`.
   - After the third iteration: `summ = ((d1 * hi + d2) * hi) + d3`.
   - And so on, until the last iteration: `summ = (((...((d1 * hi + d2) * hi + d3) * hi + ...) * hi) + dn`.

4. **Final Value of `summ`**:
   - The final value of `summ` will be a polynomial expression in terms of `hi` and the elements of `ds`.
   - Specifically, `summ` will be `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`.

5. **Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute for each element in `ds`, so `ds` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ub` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `summ` must be less than or equal to `ub` after all iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- The tuple (`'B'`, `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed.
- `summ` is `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is `d1 * hi^(n-1) + d2 * hi^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * hi + dn`, where `hi = maxds + 3`, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.**
