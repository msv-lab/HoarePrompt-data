To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

Given State:
- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 3`.
- `summ` is 0.
- The tuple (`'B'`, `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed.
- `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.

For Loop Statement:
```
for d in ds:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **List `ds`**: The loop will iterate over the elements in `ds`. For the loop to execute, `ds` must have at least one element. Since it is given that `ds` has at least 2 elements, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Variable `d`**: This variable will be set to each element of `ds` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`ub`, `doprint`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, `summ`) are used within the context of the loop but do not directly affect whether the loop can start executing. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `ds` must have at least one element. Given that `ds` already has at least 2 elements, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, `summ` is 0, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**.
