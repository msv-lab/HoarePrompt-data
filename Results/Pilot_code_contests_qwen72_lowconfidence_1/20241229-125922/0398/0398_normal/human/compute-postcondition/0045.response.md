Given the `while True` loop, the loop condition will always evaluate to `True`, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is an explicit break condition within the loop body (which is not shown here). Since the loop condition does not depend on any of the provided variables (`ds`, `ub`, `doprint`, `maxds`, `lo`, `hi`, `summ`), no adjustments to these variables are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `hi`. If `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed. Additionally, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.**
