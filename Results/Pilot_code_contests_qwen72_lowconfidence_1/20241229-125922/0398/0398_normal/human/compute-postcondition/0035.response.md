The code snippet updates the value of `summ` by multiplying its current value by `hi` and then adding `d`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `summ` was initially the sum of the first element in `ds`.
- `hi` is defined as `maxds + 2`.
- `d` is the second element in `ds`.

Thus, the new value of `summ` is calculated as:
\[ \text{summ} = \text{summ} \times (\text{maxds} + 2) + \text{d} \]

The updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
- `ub` is a non-negative integer.
- `doprint` is true.
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
- `d` is the second element in `ds`.
- `hi` is `maxds + 2`.
- `summ` is now \(\text{summ} \times (\text{maxds} + 2) + \text{d}\).

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `d` is the second element in `ds`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is \(\text{summ} \times (\text{maxds} + 2) + \text{d}\)**.
