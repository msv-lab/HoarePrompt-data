The code snippet `summ = 0` reassigns the variable `summ` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `summ`, which was calculated as `d1 * (maxds + 3)^(n-1) + d2 * (maxds + 3)^(n-2) + ... + dn-1 * (maxds + 3) + dn` and was less than or equal to `ub`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `ub` is a non-negative integer
- `doprint` is true
- `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`
- `lo` is `maxds + 1`
- `hi` is `maxds + 4`
- The tuple ('B', `hi - 2`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed
- `summ` is now 0
- If `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, `summ`, `ub`, `False`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 4`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 2`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `summ` is 0, if `doprint` is true, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, `False`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`.**
