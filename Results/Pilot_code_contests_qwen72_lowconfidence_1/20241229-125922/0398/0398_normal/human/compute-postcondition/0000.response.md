The code reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace and newline characters, splits the line by a colon (`:`), and then applies the function `processds` to each part of the split string, assigning the results to `hs` and `ms`.

Given the initial state, `hs` and `ms` are tuples containing the minimum and maximum possible radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively. The function `processds` is applied to these strings, which likely processes them into the format expected (tuples of integers with the format `(min_radix, max_radix)`).

Since the exact implementation of `processds` is not provided, we can only infer that `hs` and `ms` will be updated to the results of applying `processds` to the input parts.

Output State: **`hs` and `ms` are now tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36.**
