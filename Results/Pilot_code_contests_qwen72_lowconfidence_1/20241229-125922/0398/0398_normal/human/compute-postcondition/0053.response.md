The code snippet `summ = summ * hi + d` updates the value of `summ`. To determine the new value of `summ`, we need to consider the following:

- `summ` was previously updated to `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`.
- `hi` is defined as `maxds + 3`.
- `d` is the third element in `ds`.

Given the initial state, the new value of `summ` is calculated as follows:
- The current value of `summ` is `summ * (maxds + 3) + d`.
- The new value of `summ` is `(summ * (maxds + 3) + d) * (maxds + 3) + d`.

Therefore, the updated value of `summ` is `((summ * (maxds + 3) + d) * (maxds + 3)) + d`.

All other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `hi` is `maxds + 3`, the tuple ('B', `hi - 1`, 0, `ub`, 0 > `ub`) has been printed, `d` is the third element in `ds`, `summ` is `((summ * (maxds + 3) + d) * (maxds + 3)) + d`, `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**
