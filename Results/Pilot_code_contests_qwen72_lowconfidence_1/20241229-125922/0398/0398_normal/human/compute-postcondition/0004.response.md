The function `func_3` is called with `hs` and `23` as arguments, and the result is assigned to `hminmax`. Since the specifics of `func_3` are not provided, we assume that it processes the tuple `hs` in some way, possibly related to the value 23. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_3`, we cannot determine the exact value of `hminmax`. The values of `hs` and `ms` remain unchanged if `doprint` is True.

Output State: **`hs` and `ms` are tuples of integers representing the processed minimum and maximum radix values for the hour and minute strings, respectively, where 2 <= min_radix <= max_radix <= 36. `hminmax` is the result of `func_3(hs, 23)`. If `doprint` is True, the values of `hs` and `ms` remain unchanged.**
