The code snippet `summ = summ * hi + d` impacts the value of `summ`. Let's evaluate the changes step by step:

1. **Initial State Recap:**
   - `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `ub` is a non-negative integer.
   - `doprint` is true.
   - `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
   - `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
   - `d` is the first element in `ds`.
   - `hi` is `maxds + 2`.
   - If `doprint` is true, the tuple (`'A'`, `lo`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed.
   - `summ` is 0.

2. **Code Execution Impact:**
   - `summ` is updated to `summ * hi + d`.
   - Since `summ` was initially 0, the calculation simplifies to `0 * hi + d`, which results in `d`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `summ` is now equal to `d`.

4. **Unchanged Variables:**
   - `ds` remains a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `ub` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `doprint` remains true.
   - `maxds` remains the maximum value in `ds`.
   - `lo` remains `maxds + 1`.
   - `d` remains the first element in `ds`.
   - `hi` remains `maxds + 2`.

5. **Output State:**
   - `ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `ub` is a non-negative integer.
   - `doprint` is true.
   - `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`.
   - `lo` is `maxds + 1`.
   - `d` is the first element in `ds`.
   - `hi` is `maxds + 2`.
   - `summ` is `d`.

Output State: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `d` is the first element in `ds`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, `summ` is `d`**.
