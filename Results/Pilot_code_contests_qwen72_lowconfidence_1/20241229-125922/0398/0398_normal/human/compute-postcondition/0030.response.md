The code snippet increments the value of `hi` by 1. The value of `hi` was initially `maxds + 1`. After incrementing, `hi` becomes `maxds + 2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `if doprint is true` has already been met, and the tuple `('A', lo, summ, ub, summ > ub)` has been printed. Since `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`, this condition remains true.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`ds` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ub` is a non-negative integer, `doprint` is true, `maxds` is the maximum value in `ds`, `lo` is `maxds + 1`, `summ` is the result of converting the digits in `ds` into a single value using base `lo`, `d` is the last element in `ds`, `hi` is `maxds + 2`, if `doprint` is true, the tuple ('A', `lo`, `summ`, `ub`, `summ > ub`) has been printed, and `summ` is less than or equal to `ub`**.
