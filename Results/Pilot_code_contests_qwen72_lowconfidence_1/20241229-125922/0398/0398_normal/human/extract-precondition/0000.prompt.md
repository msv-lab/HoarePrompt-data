You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Having stayed home alone, Petya decided to watch forbidden films on the Net in secret. "What ungentlemanly behavior!" â€” you can say that, of course, but don't be too harsh on the kid. In his country films about the Martians and other extraterrestrial civilizations are forbidden. It was very unfair to Petya as he adored adventure stories that featured lasers and robots. 

Today Petya is watching a shocking blockbuster about the Martians called "R2:D2". What can "R2:D2" possibly mean? It might be the Martian time represented in the Martian numeral system. Petya knows that time on Mars is counted just like on the Earth (that is, there are 24 hours and each hour has 60 minutes). The time is written as "a:b", where the string a stands for the number of hours (from 0 to 23 inclusive), and string b stands for the number of minutes (from 0 to 59 inclusive). The only thing Petya doesn't know is in what numeral system the Martian time is written.

Your task is to print the radixes of all numeral system which can contain the time "a:b".

Input

The first line contains a single string as "a:b" (without the quotes). There a is a non-empty string, consisting of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String a shows the number of hours. String b is a non-empty string that consists of numbers and uppercase Latin letters. String b shows the number of minutes. The lengths of strings a and b are from 1 to 5 characters, inclusive. Please note that strings a and b can have leading zeroes that do not influence the result in any way (for example, string "008:1" in decimal notation denotes correctly written time).

We consider characters 0, 1, ..., 9 as denoting the corresponding digits of the number's representation in some numeral system, and characters A, B, ..., Z correspond to numbers 10, 11, ..., 35.

Output

Print the radixes of the numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b" in the increasing order. Separate the numbers with spaces or line breaks. If there is no numeral system that can represent time "a:b", print the single integer 0. If there are infinitely many numeral systems that can represent the time "a:b", print the single integer -1.

Note that on Mars any positional numeral systems with positive radix strictly larger than one are possible.

Examples

Input

11:20


Output

3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

Input

2A:13


Output

0


Input

000B:00001


Output

-1

Note

Let's consider the first sample. String "11:20" can be perceived, for example, as time 4:6, represented in the ternary numeral system or as time 17:32 in hexadecimal system. 

Let's consider the second sample test. String "2A:13" can't be perceived as correct time in any notation. For example, let's take the base-11 numeral notation. There the given string represents time 32:14 that isn't a correct time.

Let's consider the third sample. String "000B:00001" can be perceived as a correct time in the infinite number of numeral systems. If you need an example, you can take any numeral system with radix no less than 12.
Program:
```
def func_4():
    (hs, ms) = map(processds, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split(':'))
    if doprint:
        print((hs, ms))
    hminmax = func_3(hs, 23)
    if hminmax[0] == 0:
        return [0]
    mminmax = func_3(ms, 59)
    if mminmax[0] == 0:
        return [0]
    if hminmax[0] == -1 and mminmax[0] == -1:
        return [-1]
    if hminmax[0] == -1:
        return range(mminmax[0], mminmax[1] + 1)
    if mminmax[0] == -1:
        return range(hminmax[0], hminmax[1] + 1)
    if hminmax[0] > mminmax[1]:
        return [0]
    if mminmax[0] > hminmax[1]:
        return [0]
    return range(max([hminmax[0], mminmax[0]]), min([hminmax[1], mminmax[1]]) + 1)
```
