The code snippet updates the values of `Ll`, `L`, and `Lr` based on the elements of the list `a` at the indices `l - 1`, `l`, and `l + 1` respectively. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
- `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input
- `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\)
- `i` is 0
- `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output
- `q` is greater than 0
- `ans` is a list of `q` zeros
- `l` is `l_1`
- `r` is `r_1`
- `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`
- `L` is `a[l_1]`
- `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`
- `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`
- `R` is `a[r_1]`
- `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`
- `a[l]` is `R`
- `a[r]` is `L`

After executing the code snippet:
- `Ll` is updated to `a[l - 1]`
- `L` is updated to `a[l]`
- `Lr` is updated to `a[l + 1]`

The values of `Ll`, `L`, and `Lr` are now:
- `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`
- `L` is `a[l]`
- `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`

Since `a[l]` was previously set to `R` and `a[r]` was set to `L`, the new values are:
- `Ll` is `a[l - 1]` (unchanged)
- `L` is `R` (since `a[l]` was set to `R`)
- `Lr` is `a[l + 1]` (unchanged)

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `R`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`, `a[l]` is `R`, `a[r]` is `L`**
