You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: The code snippet `ans[i] = d` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `d`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` is 0, meaning this operation affects the first element of the list `ans`.
- `d` is a value that was previously calculated or defined in the context before this line of code. Since the exact value of `d` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value here. However, it is clear that `d` is the result of some prior computation.

The initial state also includes several other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `Ll`, `L`, `Lr`, `Rl`, `R`, `Rr`) which remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `a[r_1]`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`, `a[l]` is `R`, `a[r]` is `L`, `ans[0]` is `d`. If `r < n`, then: If `a[r + 2] < Rr > R`, then `d` is updated to `d + Rr`. If `a[r + 2] > Rr < R`, then `d` is updated to `d - Rr`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. If `r >= n`, `d` remains unchanged.**
```
for (i, x) in enumerate(b):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
