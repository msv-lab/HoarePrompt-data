The code snippet `b = [map(int, stdin.readline().split(), (10, 10)) for _ in xrange(q)]` reads `q` lines from the standard input, each line is split into parts, converted to integers, and mapped to a tuple `(10, 10)`. However, this usage of `map` with the third argument is not typical and might not work as intended. Assuming the intention is to map the input to integers and store them in a list of tuples, each containing two integers, the actual behavior will be different due to the misuse of the `map` function.

Given the typical usage, the correct interpretation would be that each line should contain exactly two integers, and these integers are read and stored in the list `b` as tuples. Since the initial state specifies that `q` is the number of operations, and each operation is a pair `(l_i, r_i)`, the list `b` will contain `q` tuples, each representing one of the operations.

Therefore, the updated state after executing the code is:

- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5
- `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5
- The list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are the integers read from the input
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5
- The sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5
- `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations `(l_i, r_i)`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are the integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs `(l_i, r_i)` where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations `(l_i, r_i)`**
