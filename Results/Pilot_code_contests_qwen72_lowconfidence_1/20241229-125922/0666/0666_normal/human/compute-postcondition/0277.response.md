Functionality: ** The function reads input data for a series of test cases, each involving a list of Pokémon strengths and a set of swap operations. It calculates the sum of the differences between local maxima and minima in the Pokémon strength list before and after applying the swap operations. The function then prints the initial sum and the updated sums after each operation. The function does not return any value. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of Pokémon (`n`) and the number of operations (`q`). It also reads the list of Pokémon strengths (`a`) and the list of operation pairs (`b`).

2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: It calculates an initial sum (`s`) based on the differences between local maxima and minima in the Pokémon strength list `a`.

3. **Operation Processing**: For each operation in the list `b`, it swaps the Pokémon strengths at the specified indices and updates the sum (`d`) by recalculating the differences between local maxima and minima around the swapped indices.

4. **Output**: The function prints the initial sum `s` and the updated sums after each operation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `q` is 0, the function prints the initial sum `s` and returns immediately without processing any operations.
   - If the swap indices are the same (`l == r`), the function sets the corresponding entry in the `ans` list to the current value of `d` and continues to the next operation.
   - The function handles the boundaries of the list `a` by checking if the indices are within valid ranges before performing comparisons and updates.

6. **Missing Functionality**:
   - The function does not handle invalid input, such as out-of-range indices or non-integer values.
   - The function assumes that the input is always well-formed and does not include validation checks.
   - The function does not handle cases where the input list `a` might contain duplicate values, which could affect the calculation of local maxima and minima.**

After the function executes, the state of the program is as follows:
- The initial sum `s` has been calculated and printed.
- The list `a` has been modified according to the swap operations.
- The list `ans` contains the updated sums after each operation.
- The final sums after each operation have been printed. **
