The code snippet `s += a[i]` adds the value of `a[i]` to `s`. To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial conditions and how this operation affects the variables.

Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5
- `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5
- The list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input
- The list of operations is represented by `q` pairs `(l_i, r_i)` where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5
- The sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5
- `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations `(l_i, r_i)`
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2
- If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` < `a[i + 1]`, then `s` is set to `-a[1]`. Otherwise, `s` remains 0

Step-by-step Impact:
1. The value of `s` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it.
2. The value of `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
3. The value of `a[2]` is added to `s`.

Since `s` was initially set to `-a[1]` if the condition `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` < `a[i + 1]` was met, otherwise it was 0, the new value of `s` will be:

- If `a[1]` > `a[2]` < `a[3]`, then `s` was `-a[1]` and now becomes `-a[1] + a[2]`.
- Otherwise, `s` was 0 and now becomes `a[2]`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs `(l_i, r_i)` where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations `(l_i, r_i)`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is `-a[1] + a[2]` if `a[1]` > `a[2]` < `a[3]` otherwise `s` is `a[2]`.**
