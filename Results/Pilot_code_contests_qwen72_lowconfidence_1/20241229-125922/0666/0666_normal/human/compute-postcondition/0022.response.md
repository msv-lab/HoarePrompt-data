The code snippet `stdout.write('%d\n' % s)` writes the value of `s` to the standard output, followed by a newline. This operation does not alter the values of any variables in the program's state; it only affects the output.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output. Here's the detailed output state:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 \leq q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output.**
