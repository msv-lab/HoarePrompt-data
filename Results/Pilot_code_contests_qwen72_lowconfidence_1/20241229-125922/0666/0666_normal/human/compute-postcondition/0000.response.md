The provided Python code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The values of `t`, the list `a`, and the list of operations remain unchanged, but now `n` and `q` have specific values read from the input.

Output State: **t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, the list `a` contains n distinct positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the list of operations is represented by q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
