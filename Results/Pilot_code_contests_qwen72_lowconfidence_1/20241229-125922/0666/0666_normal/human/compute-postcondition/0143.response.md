The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. This does not change any variable values but affects the flow control. Since no variables are updated by this statement, the state of the variables remains the same as before.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 1, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_i`, `r` is `r_i`, `Ll` is `a[l_2 - 1]`, `L` is `a[r_2]`, `Lr` is `a[l_2 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_2 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_2]`, `Rr` is `a[r_2 + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `R`, `a[r_2]` is `L`, `ans[1]` is `d`. If `r < n`, then: If `a[r + 2] < Rr > R`, then `d` is updated to `d + Rr`. If `a[r + 2] > Rr < R`, then `d` is updated to `d - Rr`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. If `r >= n`, `d` remains unchanged.**
