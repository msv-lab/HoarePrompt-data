The code snippet `d += Rr` increments the value of `d` by the value of `Rr`. Given the initial state, let's evaluate the impact:

- `d` is updated to `d + Rr`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `Ll`, `L`, `Lr`, `Rl`, `R`, `Rr`, `a[l_2]`, `a[r_2]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 1, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_i`, `r` is `r_i`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `R`, `a[r_2]` is `L`, `d` is `d + Rr`, `ans[1]` remains unchanged.**
