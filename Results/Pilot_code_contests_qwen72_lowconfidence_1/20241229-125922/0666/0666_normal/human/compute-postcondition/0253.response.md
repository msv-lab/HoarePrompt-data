Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 2, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `b[0][0]`, `r` is `b[0][1]`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `a[r]` (before the swap), `a[r_2]` is `a[l]` (before the swap). If `Ll < L > Lr`, then `d` is updated to `d + a[l]`. Otherwise, if `Ll > L < Lr`, then `d` is updated to `d - L`. Additionally, if `l > 1`: If `a[l - 2] < Ll > L`, then `d` is incremented by `Ll`. If `a[l - 2] > Ll < L`, then `d` is decremented by `Ll`. If `r < n`: If `a[r + 2] < Rr > R`, then `d` is decremented by `Rr`. If `a[r + 2] > Rr < R`, then `d` is incremented by `Rr`. If `r >= n` or `l <= 1`, `d` remains unchanged. If `Ll <= L` or `Lr <= L`, `d` remains unchanged.***
