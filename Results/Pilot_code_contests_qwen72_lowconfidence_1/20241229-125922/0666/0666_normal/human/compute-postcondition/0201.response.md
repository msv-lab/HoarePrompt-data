The code snippet `d += Rr` updates the value of `d` by adding the value of `Rr` to it. Here's the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input.
   - `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list of `q` zeros.
   - `l` is `l_i`.
   - `r` is `r_i`.
   - `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`.
   - `L` is `a[l]`.
   - `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`.
   - `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`.
   - `R` is `a[r]`.
   - `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`.
   - `a[l_2]` is `a[r]`.
   - `a[r_2]` is `a[l]`.
   - If `Rl < R > Rr`, `d` is updated to `d + R`.
   - If `Rl > R < Rr`, `d` is updated to `d - R`.
   - Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `d += Rr` adds the value of `Rr` to `d`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `d` is updated to `d + Rr`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - The new value of `d` is `d + Rr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 1, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_i`, `r` is `r_i`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `a[r]`, `a[r_2]` is `a[l]`, `d` is `d + Rr`.**
