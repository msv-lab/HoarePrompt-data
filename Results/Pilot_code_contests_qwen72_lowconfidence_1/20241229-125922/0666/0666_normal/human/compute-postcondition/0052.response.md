Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `a[l_1]`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`. If `Ll` is less than `L` and `L` is greater than `Lr`, `d` is updated to `d - L`. If `Ll` is greater than `L` and `L` is less than `Lr`, `d` is increased by the value of `a[l_1]`. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged. Additionally, the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1.***
