The code snippet `d -= R` impacts the variable `d` by subtracting the value of `R` from it. Given that `R` is greater than both `Rl` and `Rr`, `R` is a local maximum in the list `a`.

Here's the updated state:

- `d` is now `d - R`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\), `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `a[l_1]`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is less than `R` and `R` is greater than `Rr`, `d` is `d - R`.**
