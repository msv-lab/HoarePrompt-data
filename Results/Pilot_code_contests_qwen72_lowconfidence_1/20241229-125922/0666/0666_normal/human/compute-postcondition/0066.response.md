The code snippet `d += Rl` increments the value of `d` by the value of `Rl`. Given that `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, this means `d` is updated by adding the value of `a[r_1 - 1]` to its current value.

Here's the updated state:

- `t` remains a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` remains an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `q` remains an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- The list `a` remains a list of `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input.
- The list of operations remains represented by `q` pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).
- `b` remains a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\).
- `i` remains 0.
- `s` remains the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output.
- `q` remains greater than 0.
- `ans` remains a list of `q` zeros.
- `l` remains `l_1`.
- `r` remains `r_1`.
- `Ll` remains `a[l_1 - 1]`.
- `L` remains `a[l_1]`.
- `Lr` remains `a[l_1 + 1]`.
- `Rl` remains `a[r_1 - 1]`.
- `R` remains `a[r_1]`.
- `Rr` remains `a[r_1 + 1]`.
- `d` is now `d + Rl`.

Given the initial conditions, the only change is in the value of `d`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `a[l_1]`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`, `d` is `d + Rl`**.
