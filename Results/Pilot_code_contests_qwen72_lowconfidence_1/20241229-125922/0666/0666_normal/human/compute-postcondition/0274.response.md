Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` integers where each `ans[i]` is the value of `d` after processing the `i`-th operation, `d` is the final value of the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum after all operations have been applied, `i` is `q - 1`, `l` is `b[q-1][0]`, `r` is `b[q-1][1]`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a` has been modified such that for each operation \((l_i, r_i)\), the elements `a[l_i]` and `a[r_i]` have been swapped.**
