The code snippet `d -= Lr` updates the value of `d` by subtracting the value of `Lr` from it. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step impact on the program:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `d`: This variable holds a value that has been previously calculated or updated.
   - `Lr`: This variable holds the value of `a[l + 1]`.

2. **Update the Value of `d`:**
   - The value of `d` is decreased by the value of `Lr`.

3. **Check the Precondition:**
   - `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input.
   - `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output.
   - `q` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a list of `q` zeros.
   - `l` is `l_i`.
   - `r` is `r_i`.
   - `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`.
   - `L` is `a[l]`.
   - `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`.
   - `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`.
   - `R` is `a[r]`.
   - `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`.
   - `a[l_2]` is `a[r]`.
   - `a[r_2]` is `a[l]`.
   - If `Ll < L > Lr`, `d` is `d + a[l]`.
   - If `Ll > L < Lr`, `d` is `d - a[l]`.
   - Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The value of `d` is updated to `d - Lr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 1, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_i`, `r` is `r_i`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `a[r]`, `a[r_2]` is `a[l]`, `d` is `d - Lr`.**
