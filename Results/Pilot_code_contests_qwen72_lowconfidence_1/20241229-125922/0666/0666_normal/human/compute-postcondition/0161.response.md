The code snippet `d -= Rl` modifies the value of `d` by subtracting the value of `Rl` from it. Hereâ€™s the updated state:

- `d` is now `d - Rl`
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 1, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_i`, `r` is `r_i`, `Ll` is `a[l - 1]`, `L` is `a[l]`, `Lr` is `a[l + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r - 1]`, `R` is `a[r]`, `Rr` is `a[r + 1]`, `a[l_2]` is `R`, `a[r_2]` is `L`. If `r - l > 1`, and `a[l + 2] < Lr > L`, then `d` is `d - a[l + 1]`. If `a[l + 2] > Lr < L`, then `d` is `d + a[l + 1]`. In both cases, `ans[1]` is `d` if `l > 1` and either `a[l - 2] < Ll > L` or `a[l - 2] > Ll < L`; otherwise, `d` and `ans[1]` remain unchanged. If `r - l <= 1`, `d` and `ans[1]` remain unchanged. `d` is now `d - Rl`.**
