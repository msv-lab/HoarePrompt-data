The function `func_1` appears to be incomplete as provided, but based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it seems the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function should accept:
  - `n` and `q`: Two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, representing the number of pokémon and the number of operations, respectively.
  - `a`: A list of n distinct positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the strengths of the pokémon.
  - `operations`: A list of q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, indicating the indices of pokémon to be swapped.

However, since the function `func_1` as defined does not actually take any parameters and does not return anything, the provided function signature does not match the described functionality.

Given the context, the correct functionality should be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept parameters for multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of pokémon (`n`), the number of operations (`q`), a list of pokémon strengths (`a`), and a list of operation pairs (`operations`). However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
