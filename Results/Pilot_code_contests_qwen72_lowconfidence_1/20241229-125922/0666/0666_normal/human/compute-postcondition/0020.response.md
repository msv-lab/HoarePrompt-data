Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 \leq q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs \((l_i, r_i)\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\), the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\), `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[2] > a[3] < a[4]`, then `s` is \(-a[2] + 2 * a[3]\). Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
