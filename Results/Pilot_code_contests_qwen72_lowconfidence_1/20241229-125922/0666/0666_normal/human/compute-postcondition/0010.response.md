Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer read from input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `q` is an integer read from input where 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, the list `a` contains `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, the list of operations is represented by `q` pairs `(l_i, r_i)` where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations `(l_i, r_i)`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1]` > `a[i]` < `a[i + 1]`, then `s` is set to `-a[1]`. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
