The code snippet `d += Rl` modifies the variable `d` by adding the value of `Rl` to it. Given the initial state, `Rl` is defined as `a[r_1 - 1]`. Since `r_1` is `r` and `Rl` is already calculated, the only change is in `d`.

Therefore, the updated state includes:
- `d` is now `d + Rl`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer read from input where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `q` is an integer read from input where \(0 < q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list containing `n + 2` elements where the first and last elements are `0` and the middle `n` elements are integers read from the input, `b` is a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers read from the input, representing the operations \((l_i, r_i)\), `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` where `a[i]` is a local maximum and the negative of the differences where `a[i]` is a local minimum, and the value of `s` has been printed to the standard output, `q` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list of `q` zeros, `l` is `l_1`, `r` is `r_1`, `Ll` is `a[l_1 - 1]`, `L` is `a[r_1]`, `Lr` is `a[l_1 + 1]`, `Rl` is `a[r_1 - 1]`, `R` is `a[r_1]`, `Rr` is `a[r_1 + 1]`, `a[l]` is `R`, `a[r]` is `L`, `d` is `d + Rl`. The difference `r - l` is greater than 2, and the condition `a[r - 2] < Rl > R` holds.**
