t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n and q as integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, representing the number of pokémon and the number of operations, respectively. a is a list of n distinct positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the strengths of the pokémon. Each of the following q lines contains two integers l_i and r_i where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, representing the indices of pokémon to be swapped. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
