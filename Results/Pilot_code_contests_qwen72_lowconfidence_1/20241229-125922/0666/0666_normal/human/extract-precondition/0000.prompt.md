You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pokémon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pokémon! Pokémon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pokémon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pokémon — there were exactly n pikachu. The strength of the i-th pokémon is equal to a_i, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array b from k indices such that 1 ≤ b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_k ≤ n, and his army will consist of pokémons with forces a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, ..., a_{b_k}.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + ....

Andrew is experimenting with pokémon order. He performs q operations. In i-th operation Andrew swaps l_i-th and r_i-th pokémon.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pokémon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pokémon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) denoting the number of pokémon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains n distinct positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) denoting the strengths of the pokémon.

i-th of the last q lines contains two positive integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) denoting the indices of pokémon that were swapped in the i-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

For each test case, print q+1 integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.

Note

Let's look at the third test case:

Initially we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be 5-3+7=9.

After first operation we can build an army in such way: [2 1 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be 2-1+5-3+7=10.

After second operation we can build an army in such way: [2 1 5 4 3 7 6], its strength will be 2-1+5-3+7=10.

After third operation we can build an army in such way: [2 1 4 5 3 7 6], its strength will be 2-1+5-3+7=10.

After forth operation we can build an army in such way: [1 2 4 5 3 7 6], its strength will be 5-3+7=9.

After all operations we can build an army in such way: [1 4 2 5 3 7 6], its strength will be 4-2+5-3+7=11.
