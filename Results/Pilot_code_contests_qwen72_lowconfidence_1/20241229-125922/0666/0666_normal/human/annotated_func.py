#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ q ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, representing the number of pokémon and the number of operations, respectively. The list a contains n distinct positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the strengths of the pokémon. The list of operations is represented by q pairs (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, indicating the indices of pokémon to be swapped. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data for a series of test cases, each involving a list of Pokémon strengths and a set of swap operations. It calculates the sum of the differences between local maxima and minima in the Pokémon strength list before and after applying the swap operations. The function then prints the initial sum and the updated sums after each operation. The function does not return any value. Here are the key points:
