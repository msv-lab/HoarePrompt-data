The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, specifically two integers `n` and `k` followed by `n-1` lines each containing a tuple `(a, b)`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters. The function does not return any value directly. Instead, the effect of the function is to process the input data and potentially produce some output or side effects through the `func_1` function. The function assumes that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6`, and `edges` is a list of tuples `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n` and `a ≠ b`. Edge cases such as invalid input formats or values outside the specified range are not handled within `func_2`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes depends on the behavior of `func_1`.
