n is an integer representing the number of districts, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. The list edges contains exactly n-1 tuples, and it is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.
