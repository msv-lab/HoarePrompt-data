#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of districts), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing roads connecting districts). It constructs a data structure to represent the graph of districts and their connections, then processes the graph to mark certain nodes based on the value of `k`. Finally, it prints a list of district indices that have not been marked. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Here are the key points and potential edge cases:

1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and edges is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, representing the roads connecting the districts.
def func_2():
    sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    edges = [map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()) for _ in xrange(n - 1)]
    func_1(n, k, edges)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, specifically two integers `n` and `k` followed by `n-1` lines each containing a tuple `(a, b)`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters. The function does not return any value directly. Instead, the effect of the function is to process the input data and potentially produce some output or side effects through the `func_1` function. The function assumes that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6`, and `edges` is a list of tuples `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n` and `a ≠ b`. Edge cases such as invalid input formats or values outside the specified range are not handled within `func_2`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes depends on the behavior of `func_1`.
