Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the algorithm used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the remaining districts are connected after removing `k` contestants. The problem description requires that "all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another," but the current implementation does not enforce this connectivity constraint.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

### Example Input:
```
6 3
2 1
2 6
4 2
5 6
2 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
1 3 4
```

### Actual Output:
The current implementation may output a different set of districts that are not necessarily connected, such as:
```
1 3 5
```

In this case, removing districts 1, 3, and 5 would leave districts 2, 4, and 6, which are not all reachable from one another. This violates the requirement that all remaining districts must be connected.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component.
