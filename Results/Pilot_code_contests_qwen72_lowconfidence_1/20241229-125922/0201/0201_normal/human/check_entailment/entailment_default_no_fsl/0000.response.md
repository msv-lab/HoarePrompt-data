Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Graph Construction**: The `func_1` function constructs a graph using an adjacency list representation stored in the `storage` array. This is done efficiently using a custom data structure to manage the edges and their connections.

2. **Tree Traversal**: The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and mark the nodes. This ensures that all nodes are processed in a way that respects the tree structure.

3. **Node Marking**: The program marks nodes based on the value of `k` and the requirement to maximize the total number of fans. It ensures that the remaining nodes are connected and the total number of fans is maximized.

4. **Output Generation**: After processing, the program generates the list of districts to remove and prints them in increasing order.

### Verification of Key Points and Potential Edge Cases:

- **Input Handling**: The `func_2` function reads input from standard input and passes it to `func_1`. It correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.
- **Graph Representation**: The `storage` and `lookup` arrays are used to efficiently store and access the graph edges, ensuring that the graph is constructed correctly.
- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS traversal ensures that all nodes are visited and processed correctly, maintaining the tree structure.
- **Node Marking Logic**: The logic for marking nodes and determining which nodes to remove is implemented to ensure that the remaining nodes are connected and the total number of fans is maximized.
- **Output Format**: The output is generated in the correct format, printing the district numbers in increasing order.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `6 3\n2 1\n2 6\n4 2\n5 6\n2 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 3 4`
  - The program correctly identifies that removing districts 1, 3, and 4 maximizes the total number of fans while keeping the remaining districts connected.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `8 4\n2 6\n2 7\n7 8\n1 2\n3 1\n2 4\n7 5`
  - Expected Output: `1 3 4 5`
  - The program correctly identifies that removing districts 1, 3, 4, and 5 maximizes the total number of fans while keeping the remaining districts connected.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
