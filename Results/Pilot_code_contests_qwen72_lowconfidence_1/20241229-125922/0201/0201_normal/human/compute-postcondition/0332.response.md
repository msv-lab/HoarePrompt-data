The value of `nodes[p + 1]` is set to 1. The initial state specifies that `nodes[p + 1]` is already 1, so this assignment does not change the value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[p + 1] = 1`, `new_nodes` is a non-empty list, `p` is the second element in `new_nodes`, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - 2 * len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`, and `c` is greater than or equal to 0.**
