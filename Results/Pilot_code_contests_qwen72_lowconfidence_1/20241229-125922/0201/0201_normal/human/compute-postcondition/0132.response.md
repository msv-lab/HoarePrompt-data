The code `new_nodes.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. The value of `p` is `n * 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last district processed (or `n` if the stack was initially populated only with `n` and no other districts were added), `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`, `p` is `n * 2`. If `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, `abort` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is neither -1 nor 1, `abort` is `False` and `flag` remains unchanged.**
