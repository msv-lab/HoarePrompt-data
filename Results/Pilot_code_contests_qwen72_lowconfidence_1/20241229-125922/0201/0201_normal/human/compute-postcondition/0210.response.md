The code snippet `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value of `nodes[p]` to the variable `index`. Given that `p` is `2 * (n - 1)`, this means `index` will now hold the value stored in `nodes[2 * (n - 1)]`.

Let's list the impact of this code on the program:

- `index` is updated to the value of `nodes[2 * (n - 1)]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `index` is `nodes[2 * (n - 1)]`, `p` is `2 * (n - 1)`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` is `[2 * (n - 1)]`, `flag` is `nodes[2 * (n - 1) + 1]`, if `flag` is `-1`, `abort` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, if `flag` is `1`, `abort` is `False`, if `c` ≥ 0, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, if `c` < 0, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for all `j` from 0 to `-c - 1`.**
