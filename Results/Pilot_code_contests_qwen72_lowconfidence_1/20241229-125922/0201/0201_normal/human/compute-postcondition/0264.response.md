To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the condition that allows the loop to run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, `-c` must be greater than 0. This means that `c` must be less than 0. Let's break down the given state and identify what needs to be adjusted:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`
- `abort` is a boolean
- If `abort` is `True`:
  - For each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `-1`
  - `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal
  - `p` is the last element in `new_nodes`
  - `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
  - `t` is -1
  - `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
  - `count` is `n - k`
  - `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
  - `new_nodes` contains all the indices traversed in the loop
  - `flag` is `-1`
  - The loop terminates if `index` is less than or equal to 0
- If `abort` is `False`:
  - The state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition
- Additionally, `c` is less than 0

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `-c` is greater than 0, which means `c` must be less than 0.
- From the given state, `c` is defined as `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`.
- To ensure `c` is less than 0, we need:
  - `(n - k) - len(new_nodes) < 0`
  - This simplifies to `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`

### Adjustments Needed:
- `len(new_nodes)` must be greater than `n - k`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 0**
