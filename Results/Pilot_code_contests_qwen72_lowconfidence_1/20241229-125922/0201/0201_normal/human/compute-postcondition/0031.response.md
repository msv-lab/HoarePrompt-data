The code snippet initializes a new list `nodes` with zeros, and its length is twice the value of `n + 1`.

- `nodes` is initialized as `[0] * (2 * (n + 1))`, which means `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros.

All other variables (`n`, `k`, `edges`, `storage`, `storage_index`, `lookup`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1. If `edges` is empty, `storage` remains all -1s, `storage_index` is 0, and `lookup` remains all -1s, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros.**
