The code `lookup[u] = storage_index` updates the value of `lookup[u]` to the current value of `storage_index`, which is 8.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, `storage[9]` set to `v`, and the rest of the elements set to -1
- `storage_index` is 8
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 8 and `lookup[v]` which is 6
- `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, `storage[9]` set to `v`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 8, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 8 and `lookup[v]` which is 6, `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`**
