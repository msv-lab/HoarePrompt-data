The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is assumed that this `continue` statement is part of an outer loop that is not shown here.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement:

- The values of `n`, `k`, `edges`, `storage`, `storage_index`, `lookup`, `nodes`, `stack`, `stack_pop`, `stack_append`, `index`, `parent_index`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged.
- The `continue` statement does not alter any variables but instead indicates that the current iteration of the loop should be skipped.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the fact that the current iteration of the loop is skipped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros except `nodes[v * 2]` which is `n`, `stack` is `[v]`, `stack_pop` is the method `pop` from the list `stack`, `stack_append` is the method `append` from the list `stack`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is 0, `t` is `storage[storage[t + 1]]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
