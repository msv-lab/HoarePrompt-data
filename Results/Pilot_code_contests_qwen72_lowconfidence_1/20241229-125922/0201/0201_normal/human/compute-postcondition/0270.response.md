To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the changes to the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n.
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges).
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1.
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`.
- `abort` is a boolean.
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`.
- `c` is less than 0.
- `index`, `p`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, `count` are defined as per the initial state.
- `flag` is -1.
- The loop terminates if `index` is less than or equal to 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates `-c` times.
- For each iteration `j`, the element `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to `-1`.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n.
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges).
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1.
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, and for each `j` in the range `0` to `-c - 1`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
- `abort` is a boolean.
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`.
- `c` is less than 0.
- `index`, `p`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, `count` are defined as per the initial state.
- `flag` is -1.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for all `j` in the range `0` to `-c - 1`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `index`, `p`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, `count` are defined as per the initial state, `flag` is -1.**
