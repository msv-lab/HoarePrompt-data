The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This does not alter the values of the variables directly, but it affects the flow of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all values non-negative, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop except the last two, `index` is the second-to-last value in `stack` before the loop ends, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is `storage[lookup[index]]`, `v` is `storage[lookup[index] + 1]`, and `v` is equal to `parent_index`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
