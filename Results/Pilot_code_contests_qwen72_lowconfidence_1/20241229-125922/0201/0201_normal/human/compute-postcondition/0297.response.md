Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[(n - 2) * 2]`, `index` is `nodes[(n - 2) * 2]`, `p` is `2 * nodes[(n - 2) * 2]`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1 and `count` is 0, then `c` is 0 and the loop or conditional structure is terminated. If `c` < 0, for each `j` in the range `0` to `-c - 1`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1, and `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`. If `index` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
