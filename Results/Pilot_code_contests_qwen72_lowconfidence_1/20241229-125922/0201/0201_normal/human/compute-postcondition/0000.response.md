The code snippet `sys.setcheckinterval(2147483647)` sets the interval for checking for signals and performing periodic tasks in the Python interpreter. This function call does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `edges`. The variables `n` and `k` remain positive integers with the same constraints, and `edges` remains a list of tuples representing the roads connecting the districts.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, representing the roads connecting the districts. The check interval for the Python interpreter is set to 2147483647.**
