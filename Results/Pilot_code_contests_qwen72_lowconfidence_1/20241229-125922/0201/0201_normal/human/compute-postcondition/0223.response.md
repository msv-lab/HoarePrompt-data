The line of code `index = nodes[p]` assigns the value at the position `p` in the `nodes` list to the variable `index`.

Given the initial state:
- `p` is `nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2`
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`

Let's determine the new value of `index`:

1. `p` is calculated as `nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2`.
2. `index` is then set to `nodes[p]`.

Therefore, the new value of `index` is `nodes[nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `index` is `nodes[nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` is `[2 * (n - 1), nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2 + 1]`. If `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and `abort` remains `False`.**
