The code snippet `nodes[v * 2] = index` updates the value of `nodes[v * 2]` to `index`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads between districts.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1.
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges).
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1.
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `index`.
- `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value.
- `index` is the last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n).
- `parent_index` is `index`.
- `t` is `storage[t]`.
- `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.

If `v` equals `parent_index`, no changes occur in the state of the program.

However, since the code snippet `nodes[v * 2] = index` is executed, the value of `nodes[v * 2]` is updated to `index`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads between districts, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `index`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value, `index` is the last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n), `parent_index` is `index`, `t` is `storage[t]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.**
