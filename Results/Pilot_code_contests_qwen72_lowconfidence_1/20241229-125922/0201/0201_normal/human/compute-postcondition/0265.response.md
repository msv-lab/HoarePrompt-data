The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`.

- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`.
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`.
- `j` is 0, so `new_nodes[j]` is `new_nodes[0]`.
- The index `new_nodes[0] + 1` in the `nodes` list is updated to `-1`.

The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 0**
