The `continue` statement in Python causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. However, since this is part of a loop, the next iteration will start, potentially changing the values of variables involved in the loop's logic.

Given the initial state and the presence of the `continue` statement, the output state will reflect that no direct changes occur to the variables, but the loop will proceed to the next iteration. Since the exact loop context is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the loop variables like `index`, `v`, `t`, etc., but we know that the loop will continue to run with the next set of values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all values non-negative, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `nodes[v * 2]` is `index`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop except the last two, plus `v` and the new `v` value, `index` is the second-to-last value in `stack` before the loop ends, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, `t` is `storage[t]`. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
