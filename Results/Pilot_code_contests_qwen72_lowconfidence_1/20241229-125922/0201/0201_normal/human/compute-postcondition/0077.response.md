The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the loop body and move directly to the next iteration of the loop. This means that no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the loop body after encountering the `continue` statement. All preconditions remain valid, and the state of the program does not change in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads between districts, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is set to `index`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value, `index` is the last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n), `parent_index` is `index`, `t` is `storage[t]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.**
