Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`. If `c` ≥ 0 and `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = 1` for all `p` in `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` is a non-empty list, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is 0, `c` is 0, `flag` is -1, and `abort` is `True`. If `count` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `c` < 0 and `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` contains the indices traversed by the loop, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the final index calculated as `2 * nodes[index]`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - 2 * len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`, `j` is `-c - 1`, and for each `j` in the range `0` to `-c - 1`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is `-1`. If `abort` is `False`, the state of the program remains unchanged from the precondition.***
