The code `storage[storage_index + 1] = u` updates the `storage` list by setting the element at index `storage_index + 1` to the value of `u`. Given that `storage_index` is 10, the element at index 11 (which is `storage_index + 1`) will be set to `u`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with:
  - `storage[0]` set to -1
  - `storage[1]` set to `v`
  - `storage[2]` set to -1
  - `storage[3]` set to `u`
  - `storage[4]` set to 0
  - `storage[5]` set to `v`
  - `storage[6]` set to 2
  - `storage[7]` set to `u`
  - `storage[8]` set to 4
  - `storage[9]` set to `v`
  - `storage[10]` set to 6
  - `storage[11]` set to `u` (updated by the code)
  - The rest of the elements set to -1
- `storage_index` is 10.
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except:
  - `lookup[u]` which is 8
  - `lookup[v]` which is 6
- `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, `storage[9]` set to `v`, `storage[10]` set to 6, `storage[11]` set to `u`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 10, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 8 and `lookup[v]` which is 6, `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`.**
