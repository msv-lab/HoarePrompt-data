The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end and jumps to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the control flow, which moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` contains the indices traversed by the loop, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the final index calculated as `2 * nodes[index]`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`.**
