The code snippet `new_nodes.append(p)` adds the value of `p` to the list `new_nodes`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`
- `stack` is empty
- `index` is `nodes[n * 2]`
- `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`
- If `index` is less than or equal to 0, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `n - k`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2]`
- `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`
- If `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- If `flag` is 1, `abort` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- If `flag` is neither -1 nor 1, `abort` is `False` and `flag` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

The value of `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`. After executing `new_nodes.append(p)`, the new value of `new_nodes` will be `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `stack` is empty, `index` is `nodes[n * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[n * 2] * 2`, if `index` is less than or equal to 0, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`. If `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is 1, `abort` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `flag` is neither -1 nor 1, `abort` is `False` and `flag` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
