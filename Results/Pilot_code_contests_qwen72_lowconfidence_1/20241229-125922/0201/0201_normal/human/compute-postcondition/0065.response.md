The value of `t` is updated to the value found in the `lookup` list at the position `index`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` for each unique `v` encountered in the loop is set to `index`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop except the last one, `index` is the last value in `stack` before popping, `parent_index` is `index`, `t` is `lookup[index]`, and `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop.**
