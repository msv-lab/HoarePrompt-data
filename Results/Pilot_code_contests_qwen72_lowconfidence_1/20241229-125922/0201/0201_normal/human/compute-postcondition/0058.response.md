Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros except `nodes[v * 2]` which is `n`, `stack` is `[v, v]`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is 0, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, `nodes[v * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `storage[storage[storage[t + 1]]]`. If `v` equals `parent_index` (which is 0), no changes are made to any of these variables.***
