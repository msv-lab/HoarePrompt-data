The code snippet `nodes[p + 1] = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the element at the index `p + 1` in the list `nodes`. Since `nodes[p + 1]` was already set to `-1` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `nodes[p + 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with no changes to any of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[p + 1] = -1`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a non-empty list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`**
