The code snippet updates the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. Let's break down the impact:

- `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` means that the element at the position `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the `nodes` list is set to `-1`.
- The value of `j` is not specified, so we cannot determine which specific index in `nodes` is being updated. However, we know that `new_nodes` contains indices of nodes traversed in the loop, and each element in `new_nodes` is an index into the `nodes` list.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `nodes`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` is less than 0**
