The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was 10, so the new value of `storage_index` is 12. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, `storage[9]` set to `v`, `storage[10]` set to 6, `storage[11]` set to `u`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 12, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 8 and `lookup[v]` which is 10, `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`.**
