To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1`
- `abort` is a boolean
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `-c`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` must be incremented from 0 to 1.

### Final State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1`
- `abort` is a boolean
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 1

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 1**
