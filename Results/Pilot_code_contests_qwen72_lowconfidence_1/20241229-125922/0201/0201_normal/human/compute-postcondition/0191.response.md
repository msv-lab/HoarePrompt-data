To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for `j = 0`
- `abort` is `True`
- `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`
- `stack` is empty
- `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal
- `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2
- `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `n - k`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks
- `abort` is `True`
- `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `xrange(-c)`.
2. **Value of `c`**: Given `c` is less than 0, `-c` is a positive integer. This means the loop will iterate `-c` times.
3. **Initial Value of `j`**: `j` starts at 0.
4. **Increment of `j`**: In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State:
- **`j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
- **`c`**: The value of `c` remains the same because it is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `new_nodes`, which do not change during the loop.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop condition itself.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for `j = 0`, `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 1**
