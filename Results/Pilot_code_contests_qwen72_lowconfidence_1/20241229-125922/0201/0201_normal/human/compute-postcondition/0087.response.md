The provided code snippet `stack_append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the `stack`. Here’s the step-by-step impact on the program:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n`: An integer representing the number of districts.
   - `k`: An integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
   - `edges`: A list of tuples representing roads between districts.
   - `storage`: A list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1.
   - `storage_index`: 4 * len(edges).
   - `lookup`: A list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1.
   - `nodes`: A list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `index`.
   - `stack`: Contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value.
   - `index`: The last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n).
   - `parent_index`: `index`.
   - `t`: `storage[t]`.
   - `v`: `storage[t + 1]`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `v` is appended to the `stack`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `stack` now includes the value `v` as its last element.

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads between districts.
   - `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1.
   - `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges).
   - `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1.
   - `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `index`.
   - `stack` now contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value, with the last element being `v`.
   - `index` is the last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n).
   - `parent_index` is `index`.
   - `t` is `storage[t]`.
   - `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples representing roads between districts, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[v * 2]` is now set to `index`, `stack` now contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop including the current `v` value, with the last element being `v`, `index` is the last value in `stack` before the current append operation and must be a valid district (1 ≤ index ≤ n), `parent_index` is `index`, `t` is `storage[t]`, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`.**
