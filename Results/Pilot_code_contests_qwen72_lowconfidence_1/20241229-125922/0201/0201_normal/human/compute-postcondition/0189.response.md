To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`
- `stack` is empty
- `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal
- `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2
- `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `n - k`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks
- `abort` is `True`
- `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
- `c` is less than 0

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `-c - 1`.
2. **Value of `c`**: Given that `c` is less than 0, `-c` is a positive integer. This means the loop will execute `-c` times.
3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `c` is less than 0, `-c` is a positive integer, and the loop will execute `-c` times.
   - The loop variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` needs to be set to 0 for the loop to start.
- The loop will execute `-c` times, so the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `j` should be less than `-c`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 0**
