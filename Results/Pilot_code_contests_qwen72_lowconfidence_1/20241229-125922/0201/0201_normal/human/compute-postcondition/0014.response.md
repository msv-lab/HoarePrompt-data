The code snippet `storage[storage_index + 1] = v` modifies the `storage` list by setting the element at index `storage_index + 1` to the value of `v`.

- `storage_index` is initially 4.
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` translates to `storage[5]`.
- The value of `v` is stored at `storage[1]` and is part of the initial state.

Therefore, the element at index 5 of the `storage` list is updated to the value of `v`.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a road connecting two districts a and b, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, and `edges` must have at least two tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, and the rest of the elements set to -1.
- `storage_index` is 4.
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 0 and `lookup[v]` which is 2.
- `(u, v)` is the second tuple in `edges`.

After executing the code:
- `storage[5]` is set to `v`.
- All other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a road connecting two districts a and b, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, and `edges` must have at least two tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 0 and `lookup[v]` which is 2, `(u, v)` is the second tuple in `edges`.**
