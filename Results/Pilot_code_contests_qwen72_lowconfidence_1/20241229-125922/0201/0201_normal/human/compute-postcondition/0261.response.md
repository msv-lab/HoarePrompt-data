The `break` statement causes the immediate termination of the loop or conditional structure it is contained within. Since the initial state indicates that the loop or condition terminates under certain conditions, the `break` statement effectively enforces this termination immediately.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `new_nodes` contains all the indices traversed in the loop, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is 0, `c` is 0, `flag` is -1, the loop or conditional structure is terminated, and `c` is greater than or equal to 0.**
