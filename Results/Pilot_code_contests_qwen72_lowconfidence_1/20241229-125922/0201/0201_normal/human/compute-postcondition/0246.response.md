The code snippet `nodes[p + 1] = -1` sets the element at index `p + 1` in the list `nodes` to `-1`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[p + 1]` set to `-1`, `index` is greater than 0, `p` is the next element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` contains at least one more element, `flag` is `-1`, `abort` is `True` because `flag` is `-1`.**
