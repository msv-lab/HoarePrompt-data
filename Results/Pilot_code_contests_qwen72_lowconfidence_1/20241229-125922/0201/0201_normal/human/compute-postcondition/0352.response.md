The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`.

- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts `a` and `b`, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b. The list `edges` contains exactly n-1 tuples, and it is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.

The function returns a value based on the given parameters, but the specific output criteria are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, I cannot specify the exact return value without additional context. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, the output could be related to some form of graph analysis or pathfinding involving the districts and roads.

Since the output criteria are not specified, I will describe the functionality in a general form:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of districts), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing roads connecting districts). It processes these inputs to return a result based on the given constraints and relationships.**
