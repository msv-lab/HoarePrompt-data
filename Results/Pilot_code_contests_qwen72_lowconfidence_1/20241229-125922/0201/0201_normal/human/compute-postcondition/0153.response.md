Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `stack` is empty, `index` is `nodes[nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `p` is `index * 2`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing `[n * 2, nodes[n * 2] * 2]`, `flag` is `nodes[index * 2 + 1]`, `abort` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
