The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the `nodes` list by setting the element at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1`
- `abort` is a boolean
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 1

The code modifies the `nodes` list by setting the element at the index `new_nodes[1] + 1` to `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1] = -1`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 1**
