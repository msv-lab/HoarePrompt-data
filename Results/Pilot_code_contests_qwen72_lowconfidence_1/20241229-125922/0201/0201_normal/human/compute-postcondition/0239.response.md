Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is `2 * index`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` contains all the indices traversed in the loop, `flag` is `nodes[p + 1]`. If `flag` is `-1`, `abort` is `True`, otherwise `abort` is `False`. If `index` is less than or equal to 0, the loop terminates.**
