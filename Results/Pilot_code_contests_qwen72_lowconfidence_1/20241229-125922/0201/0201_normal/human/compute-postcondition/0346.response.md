The code snippet `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` in the list `nodes` to `-1`. Given that `j` is 2, this means `nodes[new_nodes[2] + 1]` is set to `-1`.

Therefore, the updated value in `nodes` is at the index `new_nodes[2] + 1`, and it is set to `-1`. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` contains the indices traversed by the loop, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the final index calculated as `2 * nodes[index]`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - 2 * len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`, `j` is 2, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is `-1`, `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1]` is `-1`, `nodes[new_nodes[2] + 1]` is `-1`**
