The value of `storage_index` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `storage_index` was 4, so the new value is 6. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, with each tuple representing a road connecting two districts a and b, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, and `edges` must have at least two tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 6, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 4 and `lookup[v]` which is 2, `(u, v)` is the second tuple in `edges`.**
