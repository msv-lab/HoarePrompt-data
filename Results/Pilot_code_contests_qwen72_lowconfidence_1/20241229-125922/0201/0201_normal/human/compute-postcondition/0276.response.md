For the given `while True:` loop, the loop condition is always true and does not depend on any specific variable values to allow the first iteration to proceed. Therefore, no modifications to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, if `c` ≥ 0, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is `(n - 2) * 2`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `flag` is -1, the loop terminates if `index` is less than or equal to 0, and if `count` is 0, then `c` is 0 and the loop or conditional structure is terminated. If `c` < 0, for each `j` in the range `0` to `-c - 1`, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1]` is -1, `abort` is `False`, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `index`, `p`, `parent_index`, `t`, `v`, `count` are defined as per the initial state, and `flag` is -1.**
