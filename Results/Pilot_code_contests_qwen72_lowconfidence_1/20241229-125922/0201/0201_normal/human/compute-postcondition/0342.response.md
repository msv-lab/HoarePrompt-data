The code snippet `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` updates the value of the element in the `nodes` list at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`
- If `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`
- `new_nodes` contains the indices traversed by the loop
- `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal
- `p` is the final index calculated as `2 * nodes[index]`
- `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
- `c` is `(n - k) - 2 * len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0
- `flag` is -1
- `abort` is `True`
- `j` is 0

After executing the code:
- The value of `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is set to `-1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `new_nodes` contains the indices traversed by the loop, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the final index calculated as `2 * nodes[index]`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `c` is `(n - k) - 2 * len(new_nodes)` and must be less than 0, `flag` is -1, `abort` is `True`, `j` is 0, `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1]` is `-1`.**
