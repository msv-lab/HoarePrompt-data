The `break` statement causes the program to exit from the innermost loop or conditional block in which it is contained. This does not alter the values of the variables but changes the flow control.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `p` is `nodes[nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2] * 2`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` is `[2 * (n - 1), nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2, p]`, `flag` is `nodes[nodes[nodes[2 * (n - 1)] * 2] * 2 + 1]`, if `flag` is -1, `abort` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, if `flag` is 1, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
