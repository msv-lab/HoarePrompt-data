The code `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` sets the value of `nodes` at the index `new_nodes[j] + 1` to `-1`. Given that `j` is 1, this means `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1]` is set to `-1`.

Since the initial state specifies that `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for `j = 0`, and now `j` is 1, the value at `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1]` is also set to `-1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for `j = 0` and `j = 1`
- `abort` is `True`
- `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`
- `stack` is empty
- `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal
- `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2
- `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `n - k`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks
- `abort` is `True`
- `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 1
