To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1] = -1`
- `abort` is a boolean
- `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`
- `c` is less than 0
- `j` is 1

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `-c - 1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `j` is within this range.

### Current State:
- `j` is 1
- `c` is less than 0, so `-c` is a positive integer.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `-c`.

### New State:
- `j` will be incremented to 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[new_nodes[0] + 1] = -1` and `nodes[new_nodes[1] + 1] = -1`, `abort` is a boolean, `new_nodes` is a list such that `len(new_nodes) > (n - k)`, `c` is less than 0, `j` is 2**
