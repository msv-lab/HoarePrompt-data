To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n
- `edges` is a list of tuples
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n
- `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges)
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`
- If `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`
- `stack` is empty
- `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal
- `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2
- `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed
- `t` is -1
- `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop
- `count` is `n - k`
- `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop
- `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks
- `abort` is `True`
- `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`
- `c` is less than 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in xrange(-c):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `-c` is greater than 0.
2. **Value of `c`**: `c` is defined as `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`.
3. **Given `c` is less than 0**: This means `(n - k) - len(new_nodes) < 0`.

### Simplifying the Condition:
- `(n - k) - len(new_nodes) < 0` implies `n - k < len(new_nodes)`.
- Since `n - k` is the number of nodes left to process, and `len(new_nodes)` is the number of nodes already processed, this condition indicates that more nodes have been processed than there are left to process.

### Adjusting the State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state so that `-c` is greater than 0. This means `c` must be less than 0, which is already given. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start and run at least once.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `c` is negative, which is already true.
- Ensure `j` can take at least one value in the range `xrange(-c)`. This means `-c` must be a positive integer.

Given that `c` is already less than 0, `-c` will be a positive integer. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, if `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, and `c` is less than 0**.
