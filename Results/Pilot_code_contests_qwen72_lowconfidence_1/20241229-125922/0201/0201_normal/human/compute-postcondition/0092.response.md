The code snippet `t = lookup[index]` assigns the value of `lookup[index]` to the variable `t`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `t` is updated to the value of `lookup[index]`.
- The value of `index` is the second-to-last value in `stack` before the loop ends.
- The value of `lookup[index]` is the index in `storage` where the edge information starts for the district represented by `index`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop except the last two, `index` is the second-to-last value in `stack` before the loop ends, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is `lookup[index]`, and `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop.**
