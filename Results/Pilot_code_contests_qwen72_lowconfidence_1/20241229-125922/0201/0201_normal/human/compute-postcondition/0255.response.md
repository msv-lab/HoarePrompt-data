The code snippet `nodes[p + 1] = 1` updates the value of the element in the `nodes` list at the index `p + 1` to 1. Given the initial state, we know that `p` is the second-to-last element in `new_nodes`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` where `nodes[p + 1]` is 1, `new_nodes` must have at least two elements, `p` is the second-to-last element in `new_nodes`, if `abort` is `True` then for each `p` in `new_nodes` up to the second-to-last element, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `-1` and the last `p` is set to `1`, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the second-to-last element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes) + 1`, `new_nodes` contains all the indices traversed in the loop, `flag` is `-1`, the loop terminates if `index` is less than or equal to 0, and `c` is greater than or equal to 0, if `abort` is `False` then the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition and `c` is greater than or equal to 0**
