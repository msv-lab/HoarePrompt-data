The code snippet reads `n-1` lines from the standard input, each line is split into two parts which are converted to integers and stored as tuples in the list `edges`. This means that `edges` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing a road connecting two districts.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, representing the roads connecting the districts, and the check interval for the Python interpreter is set to 2147483647.**
