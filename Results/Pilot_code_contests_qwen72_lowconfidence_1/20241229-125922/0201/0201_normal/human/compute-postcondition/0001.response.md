The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overridden by these new values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers read from the standard input such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, representing the roads connecting the districts. The check interval for the Python interpreter is set to 2147483647.**
