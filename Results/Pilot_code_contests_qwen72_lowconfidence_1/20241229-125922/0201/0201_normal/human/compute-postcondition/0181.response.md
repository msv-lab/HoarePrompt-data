Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` with `nodes[p + 1]` set to `1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `abort` is `True`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is a list containing the indices of the nodes traversed in the loop and must contain at least one element, `flag` is `1`, `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)` is greater than or equal to 0**
