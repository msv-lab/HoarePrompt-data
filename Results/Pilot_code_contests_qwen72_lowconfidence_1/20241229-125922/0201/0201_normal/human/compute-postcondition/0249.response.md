Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`. If `abort` is `True`, for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `-1`, `index` is the final valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`, `new_nodes` contains all the indices traversed in the loop, `flag` is `-1`, and the loop terminates if `index` is less than or equal to 0. If `abort` is `False`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.***
