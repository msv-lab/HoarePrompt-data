The function `func_2` accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`. Here, `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraint that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6. The parameter `edges` is a list of tuples `(a, b)` where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. However, based on typical problem descriptions involving graphs and edges, it can be inferred that the function likely performs some graph-related computation or decision-making process.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers with 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, and `edges` is a list of tuples `(a, b)` representing roads connecting districts. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided.**
