The code snippet provided initializes `new_nodes` as an empty list. This impacts the state of the `new_nodes` variable but does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`. If `c` ≥ 0, `nodes[p + 1]` is set to `1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `abort` is `True`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes`, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `c`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `flag` is `1`. If `count` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` < 0, `nodes[new_nodes[j] + 1] = -1` for all `j` from 0 to `-c - 1`, `abort` is `True`, `nodes[p + 1] = -1` for each `p` in `new_nodes`, `stack` is empty, `index` is the last valid index found in the traversal, `p` is the last element in `new_nodes` * 2, `parent_index` is the parent of the last district processed, `t` is -1, `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop, `count` is `n - k`, `new_nodes` is an empty list, `flag` is the value of `nodes[p + 1]` at the point where the loop breaks, `abort` is `True`, `c` is `(n - k) - len(new_nodes)`**
