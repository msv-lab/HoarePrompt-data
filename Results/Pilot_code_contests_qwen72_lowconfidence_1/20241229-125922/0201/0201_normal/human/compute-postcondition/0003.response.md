The given code snippet calls a function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`. Since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the state within this function. However, we can assume that the function may modify the variables `n`, `k`, or `edges`, or it might return a value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6.
- `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
- The check interval for the Python interpreter is set to 2147483647.

The function call `func_1(n, k, edges)` could potentially:
- Modify the values of `n`, `k`, or `edges`.
- Return a value, which would need to be captured in the output state.

Since the function's behavior is unknown, we cannot specify exactly what changes occur. However, we can state that the function has been called and that the variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` might have been modified, and a value might have been returned.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^6, `edges` is a list of `n-1` tuples (a, b) where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, the check interval for the Python interpreter is set to 2147483647, `func_1` has been called with arguments `n`, `k`, and `edges`, and the result of `func_1` is unknown.**
