Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all values non-negative, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)`, `nodes[v * 2]` is set for all unique `v` values encountered during the loop except the last two, `stack` contains all unique `v` values encountered in the loop except the last two, `index` is the second-to-last value in `stack` before the loop ends, `parent_index` is `nodes[index * 2]`, `t` is -1 (indicating the loop has terminated), `v` is undefined or the last value processed by the loop.**
