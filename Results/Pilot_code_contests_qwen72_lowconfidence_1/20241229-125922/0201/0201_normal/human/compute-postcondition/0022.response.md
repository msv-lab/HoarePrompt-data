The code snippet `storage[storage_index] = lookup[u]` updates the `storage` list at the index `storage_index` with the value of `lookup[u]`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with specific initial values:
  - `storage[0]` is -1.
  - `storage[1]` is `v`.
  - `storage[2]` is -1.
  - `storage[3]` is `u`.
  - `storage[4]` is 0.
  - `storage[5]` is `v`.
  - `storage[6]` is 2.
  - `storage[7]` is `u`.
  - The rest of the elements are set to -1.
- `storage_index` is 8.
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 4 and `lookup[v]` which is 6.
- `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`.

Given this information, the value of `lookup[u]` is 4. The `storage_index` is 8, so the code updates `storage[8]` to 4.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of districts.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples.
- `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with specific initial values:
  - `storage[0]` is -1.
  - `storage[1]` is `v`.
  - `storage[2]` is -1.
  - `storage[3]` is `u`.
  - `storage[4]` is 0.
  - `storage[5]` is `v`.
  - `storage[6]` is 2.
  - `storage[7]` is `u`.
  - `storage[8]` is 4.
  - The rest of the elements are set to -1.
- `storage_index` is 8.
- `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 4 and `lookup[v]` which is 6.
- `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 8, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 4 and `lookup[v]` which is 6, `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`**.
