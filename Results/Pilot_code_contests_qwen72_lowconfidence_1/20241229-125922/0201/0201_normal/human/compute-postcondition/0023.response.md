The code `storage[storage_index + 1] = v` updates the `storage` list at the index `storage_index + 1` with the value of `v`. Given the initial state:

- `storage_index` is 8.
- `storage[storage_index + 1]` is `storage[9]`.
- The value of `v` is already stored in `storage[1]` and `storage[5]`.

After executing the code, `storage[9]` is set to `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with `storage[0]` set to -1, `storage[1]` set to `v`, `storage[2]` set to -1, `storage[3]` set to `u`, `storage[4]` set to 0, `storage[5]` set to `v`, `storage[6]` set to 2, `storage[7]` set to `u`, `storage[8]` set to 4, `storage[9]` set to `v`, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 8, `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with all elements set to -1 except `lookup[u]` which is 4 and `lookup[v]` which is 6, `(u, v)` is the third tuple in `edges`**.
