Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of districts), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing roads connecting districts). It constructs a data structure to represent the graph of districts and their connections, then processes the graph to mark certain nodes based on the value of `k`. Finally, it prints a list of district indices that have not been marked. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Here are the key points and potential edge cases:

1. **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input is valid, meaning `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a unique road between two districts. The list `edges` contains exactly `n-1` tuples, ensuring a connected graph without cycles.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - A list `storage` of length `4 * n` is used to store the adjacency information of the graph.
   - A list `lookup` of length `n + 1` is used to map each district to its starting index in the `storage` list.
   - The function populates `storage` and `lookup` based on the `edges` list, ensuring that each district's connections are stored.

3. **Tree Traversal**:
   - A list `nodes` of length `2 * (n + 1)` is used to store the parent of each district and a flag indicating whether the district has been processed.
   - The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from district `n` to build a traversal tree and populate the `nodes` list with parent information.

4. **Marking Nodes**:
   - The function initializes a counter `count` to `n - k`.
   - It iterates over the districts in reverse order, marking nodes based on the value of `count` and the structure of the traversal tree.
   - If a node can be marked, the function updates the `nodes` list and decrements `count`.
   - If `count` reaches zero, the function breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - The function constructs a list of district indices that have not been marked (i.e., `nodes[i * 2 + 1] != 1`) and prints this list.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, the function will mark almost all nodes, leaving only one unmarked node.
   - If `k` is 1, the function will mark only a few nodes, potentially leaving many unmarked.
   - If `edges` is empty (which should not happen due to the problem constraints), the function will not perform any meaningful operations and will print an empty list.

7. **Missing Functionality**:
   - The function does not handle invalid input gracefully. For example, if `edges` does not contain exactly `n-1` tuples or if the graph is not connected, the function may produce incorrect results or fail to terminate correctly.
   - The function does not provide any error messages or validation checks for the input parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not meet the expected constraints. **
