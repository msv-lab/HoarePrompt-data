The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since this statement is not inside a loop in the provided context, it would cause a syntax error if executed in this form. However, assuming this is part of a larger context where a loop exists, the `continue` statement would simply move to the next iteration of the loop without changing any variables.

Given that no variables are altered by the `continue` statement itself, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of districts, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a road connecting two districts a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `storage` is a list of length 4 * n with the first 4 * len(edges) elements set to specific values based on the tuples in `edges` and the rest of the elements set to -1, `storage_index` is 4 * len(edges), `lookup` is a list of length n + 1 with each element corresponding to a district u or v from the tuples in `edges` set to the index in `storage` where the edge information starts, and the rest of the elements set to -1, `nodes` is a list of length `2 * (n + 1)` filled with zeros except `nodes[v * 2]` which is `n`, `stack` is `[v, v]`, `index` is `n`, `parent_index` is 0, `v` is `storage[t + 1]`, `nodes[v * 2]` is `n`, `t` is `storage[storage[storage[t + 1]]]`**
