The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of districts), `k` (an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing roads connecting districts). It constructs a data structure to represent the graph of districts and their connections, then processes the graph to mark certain nodes based on the value of `k`. Finally, it prints a list of district indices that have not been marked. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. Here are the key points and potential edge cases:
