The code snippet reads the first `2 * n` characters from the standard input and maps them to integers, storing the result in `s`. 

- `n` remains the first integer read from input.
- `ticket` is a string of `2 * n` digits and remains unchanged.
- `s` now holds a map object containing the integers from the first `2 * n` characters of the input.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input.**
