The code snippet `sb.sort()` sorts the list `sb` in ascending order. This impacts only the `sb` list, while all other variables and their properties remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is a sorted list of the first n integers from `s`, `se` is a list of the integers from `s` starting from index `n` to the end.**
