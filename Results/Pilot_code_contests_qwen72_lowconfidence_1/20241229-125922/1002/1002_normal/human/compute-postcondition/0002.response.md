The code snippet `sb = s[:n]` creates a new variable `sb` which is a slice of the map object `s` containing the first `n` elements.

- `n` remains the first integer read from input.
- `ticket` is a string of `2 * n` digits and remains unchanged.
- `s` is a map object of integers from the first `2 * n` characters of the input.
- `sb` is now a list (or similar iterable) containing the first `n` integers from the map object `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is a list of the first n integers from `s`.**
