The line of code `n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split())[0]` reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace (including newlines), splits the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts the first element of this list to an integer, and assigns this integer to `n`.

Given the initial state where `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, the code snippet updates the value of `n` to the first integer read from the input. The `ticket` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits**
