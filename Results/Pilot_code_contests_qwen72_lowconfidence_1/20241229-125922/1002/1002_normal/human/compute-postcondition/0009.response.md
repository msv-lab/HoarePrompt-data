The code `b = sb.pop()` removes the last element from the list `sb` and assigns it to the variable `b`. The list `sb` is now one element shorter.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is a sorted list of the first n-1 integers from `s`, `se` is a sorted list of the integers from `s` starting from index `n` to the end, `lucky` is 0, `unlucky` is 0, `b` is the last element of the original `sb`**
