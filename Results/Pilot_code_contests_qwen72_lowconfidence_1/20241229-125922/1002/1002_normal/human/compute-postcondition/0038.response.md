Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two lines from the standard input. The first line is expected to contain a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line is expected to contain a string `ticket` consisting of 2n digits. The function then splits the digits into two lists `sb` and `se`, each containing n digits. These lists are sorted, and the function compares corresponding elements from `sb` and `se`. If one list consistently has elements greater than the other (either all elements in `sb` are greater than those in `se` or vice versa), the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., incorrect number of digits, non-digit characters, or out-of-range values for `n`). **
