The value of `lucky` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `lucky` is either 0 or 2, after the increment, `lucky` will be 1 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is a sorted list of the first n-3 integers from `s` and must contain at least one element, `se` is a sorted list of the integers from `s` starting from index `n` to the end (with the last two elements removed) and now has one less element, `b` is the last element of the original `sb`, `e` is the last element of the original `se` before popping, `lucky` is 1 or 3, `unlucky` is 0, 1, or 2 based on the initial conditions.**
