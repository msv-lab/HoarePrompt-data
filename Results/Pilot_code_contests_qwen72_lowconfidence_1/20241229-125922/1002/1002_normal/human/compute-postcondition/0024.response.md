Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is a sorted list of the first n-2 integers from `s` and must contain at least one element, `se` is a sorted list of the integers from `s` starting from index `n` to the end (with the last two elements removed), `b` is the second last element of the original `sb`, `e` is the last element of the original `se`. If `b` > `e`, `lucky` is 2 and `unlucky` is 0. If `b` <= `e`, `lucky` is 0 and `unlucky` is 1 if `b` < `e`, otherwise `unlucky` remains 0. If `b` < `e`, `unlucky` is incremented by 1, making it 1 if `b` <= `e` and 2 if `b` < `e`.***
