You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.

But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.

For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion. 

You have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2n digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string that consists of 2n digits and defines your ticket.

Output

In the first line print "YES" if the ticket meets the unluckiness criterion. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

Examples

Input

Program:
```
import sys
import traceback

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split())[0]
    s = map(int, list(sys.stdin.readline()[:2 * n]))
    sb = s[:n]
    se = s[n:]
    sb.sort()
    se.sort()
    lucky = 0
    unlucky = 0
    while sb:
        b = sb.pop()
        e = se.pop()
        if b > e:
            lucky += 1
        elif b < e:
            unlucky += 1
    if lucky == n or unlucky == n:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the ticket number has leading zeros correctly. For example, if the input is:

```
2
0011
```

The expected output is "NO" because the ticket does not meet the unluckiness criterion. However, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it treats the leading zeros as significant digits and performs the comparison incorrectly.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input string length is not exactly 2n. For example, if the input is:

```
2
12345
```

The program will still attempt to process the input, which violates the problem description that states the input string should contain exactly 2n digits. This can lead to incorrect behavior or unexpected results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` reads two lines from the standard input. The first line is expected to contain a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line is expected to contain a string `ticket` consisting of 2n digits. The function then splits the digits into two lists `sb` and `se`, each containing n digits. These lists are sorted, and the function compares corresponding elements from `sb` and `se`. If one list consistently has elements greater than the other (either all elements in `sb` are greater than those in `se` or vice versa), the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., incorrect number of digits, non-digit characters, or out-of-range values for `n`).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
