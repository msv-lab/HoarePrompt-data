You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Each of you probably has your personal experience of riding public transportation and buying tickets. After a person buys a ticket (which traditionally has an even number of digits), he usually checks whether the ticket is lucky. Let us remind you that a ticket is lucky if the sum of digits in its first half matches the sum of digits in its second half.

But of course, not every ticket can be lucky. Far from it! Moreover, sometimes one look at a ticket can be enough to say right away that the ticket is not lucky. So, let's consider the following unluckiness criterion that can definitely determine an unlucky ticket. We'll say that a ticket is definitely unlucky if each digit from the first half corresponds to some digit from the second half so that each digit from the first half is strictly less than the corresponding digit from the second one or each digit from the first half is strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second one. Each digit should be used exactly once in the comparisons. In other words, there is such bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and the second half of the ticket, that either each digit of the first half turns out strictly less than the corresponding digit of the second half or each digit of the first half turns out strictly more than the corresponding digit from the second half.

For example, ticket 2421 meets the following unluckiness criterion and will not be considered lucky (the sought correspondence is 2 > 1 and 4 > 2), ticket 0135 also meets the criterion (the sought correspondence is 0 < 3 and 1 < 5), and ticket 3754 does not meet the criterion. 

You have a ticket in your hands, it contains 2n digits. Your task is to check whether it meets the unluckiness criterion.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains a string that consists of 2n digits and defines your ticket.

Output

In the first line print "YES" if the ticket meets the unluckiness criterion. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import traceback

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually take two parameters: an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a string `ticket` consisting of 2n digits.
def func_1():
    n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip('\n\r ').split())[0]
    s = map(int, list(sys.stdin.readline()[:2 * n]))
    sb = s[:n]
    se = s[n:]
    sb.sort()
    se.sort()
    lucky = 0
    unlucky = 0
    while sb:
        b = sb.pop()
        
        e = se.pop()
        
        if b > e:
            lucky += 1
        elif b < e:
            unlucky += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is an empty list, `se` is an empty list, `lucky` is the number of times an element from the original `sb` was greater than the corresponding element from the original `se`, `unlucky` is the number of times an element from the original `sb` was less than the corresponding element from the original `se`.
    if (lucky == n or unlucky == n) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is the first integer read from input, `ticket` is a string of 2n digits, `s` is a map object of integers from the first 2n characters of the input, `sb` is an empty list, `se` is an empty list, `lucky` is the number of times an element from the original `sb` was greater than the corresponding element from the original `se`, `unlucky` is the number of times an element from the original `sb` was less than the corresponding element from the original `se`. `lucky` is not equal to `n` and `unlucky` is not equal to `n`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two lines from the standard input. The first line is expected to contain a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line is expected to contain a string `ticket` consisting of 2n digits. The function then splits the digits into two lists `sb` and `se`, each containing n digits. These lists are sorted, and the function compares corresponding elements from `sb` and `se`. If one list consistently has elements greater than the other (either all elements in `sb` are greater than those in `se` or vice versa), the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., incorrect number of digits, non-digit characters, or out-of-range values for `n`).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
