Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1` reads input directly from `sys.stdin` without taking parameters. According to the problem description, the function should take two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `ticket`. The current implementation reads input from standard input, which is not in line with the problem description.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for determining if the ticket is unlucky is flawed. The program checks if each digit in the first half is strictly greater or strictly less than the corresponding digit in the second half. However, the problem description requires a bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and second halves, meaning that each digit from the first half must be compared with a unique digit from the second half, and the comparison must hold for all pairs.

   - For example, the ticket "2421" is correctly identified as unlucky because 2 > 1 and 4 > 2.
   - However, the ticket "3754" is incorrectly identified as not unlucky by the program. According to the problem description, "3754" should be considered unlucky because there is a bijective correspondence (3 < 5 and 7 > 4) where one digit from the first half is strictly less and the other is strictly greater.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to take parameters and correctly implement the bijective correspondence logic. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_unlucky(n, ticket):
    # Convert the ticket string to a list of integers
    digits = [int(digit) for digit in ticket]
    
    # Split the digits into two halves
    first_half = digits[:n]
    second_half = digits[n:]
    
    # Sort both halves
    first_half.sort()
    second_half.sort()
    
    # Check for bijective correspondence
    all_less = all(f < s for f, s in zip(first_half, second_half))
    all_greater = all(f > s for f, s in zip(first_half, second_half))
    
    # Return 'YES' if either condition is met, otherwise 'NO'
    if all_less or all_greater:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'

# Example usage
n = 2
ticket = "2421"
print(is_unlucky(n, ticket))  # Output: YES

n = 2
ticket = "0135"
print(is_unlucky(n, ticket))  # Output: YES

n = 2
ticket = "3754"
print(is_unlucky(n, ticket))  # Output: NO
```

This corrected function takes the required parameters and correctly implements the bijective correspondence logic to determine if the ticket is unlucky.
