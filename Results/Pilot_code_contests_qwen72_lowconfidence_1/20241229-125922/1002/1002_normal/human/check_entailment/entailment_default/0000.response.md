Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle the problem as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires checking if there exists a bijective correspondence between the digits of the first and second halves of the ticket such that each digit from the first half is either strictly less than or strictly greater than the corresponding digit from the second half. The current implementation sorts both halves of the ticket and then compares corresponding elements, which is incorrect because sorting changes the original order of the digits, and thus the bijective correspondence is lost.

For example, consider the ticket `1324`. According to the problem description, this ticket should be considered "NO" because there is no bijective correspondence where each digit from the first half is strictly less than or greater than the corresponding digit from the second half. However, the current implementation will sort the halves to `12` and `34`, and then compare them, leading to a false positive "YES" result.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should compare the digits without sorting them, ensuring that the original order is maintained and the bijective correspondence is respected.
