Precondition: **The function should actually take two parameters: an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a string `ticket` consisting of 2n digits.** However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
```

Given this, the precondition based on the corrected function definition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and ticket is a string of length 2n consisting of digits.**
