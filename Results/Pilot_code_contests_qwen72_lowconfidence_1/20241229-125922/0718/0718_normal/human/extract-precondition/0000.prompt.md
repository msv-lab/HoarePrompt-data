You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: A sweet little monster Om Nom loves candies very much. One day he found himself in a rather tricky situation that required him to think a bit in order to enjoy candies the most. Would you succeed with the same task if you were on his place?

<image>

One day, when he came to his friend Evan, Om Nom didn't find him at home but he found two bags with candies. The first was full of blue candies and the second bag was full of red candies. Om Nom knows that each red candy weighs Wr grams and each blue candy weighs Wb grams. Eating a single red candy gives Om Nom Hr joy units and eating a single blue candy gives Om Nom Hb joy units.

Candies are the most important thing in the world, but on the other hand overeating is not good. Om Nom knows if he eats more than C grams of candies, he will get sick. Om Nom thinks that it isn't proper to leave candy leftovers, so he can only eat a whole candy. Om Nom is a great mathematician and he quickly determined how many candies of what type he should eat in order to get the maximum number of joy units. Can you repeat his achievement? You can assume that each bag contains more candies that Om Nom can eat.

Input

The single line contains five integers C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb (1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109).

Output

Print a single integer — the maximum number of joy units that Om Nom can get.

Examples

Input

10 3 5 2 3


Output

16

Note

In the sample test Om Nom can eat two candies of each type and thus get 16 joy units.
