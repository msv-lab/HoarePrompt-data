**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Integer Division Issue**:
   - The program uses the `/` operator for division, which performs floating-point division in Python 3. However, the problem requires integer division (`//`) because the number of candies Om Nom can eat must be an integer. For example, the line `c /= g` should be `c //= g` to ensure `c` remains an integer.

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the range for the loops using `range(c / w1 + 1)` and `range(c / w2 + 1)`. These should use integer division as well, e.g., `range(c // w1 + 1)` and `range(c // w2 + 1)`.

3. **Swapping Condition**:
   - The condition `if (h1 * w2 < h2 * w1):` swaps `h1` and `h2`, as well as `w1` and `w2`. This is done to ensure that the loop iterates over the smaller weight first, which is a valid optimization. However, the final result should account for the fact that the variables might have been swapped. The program does not explicitly reverse the swap before printing the result, which could lead to incorrect output in some cases.

4. **Handling Large Inputs**:
   - The program uses a fixed limit of `10 ** 5` for the range of the loop when `c` is large. While this is a heuristic to optimize performance, it might not always yield the correct result. The problem description does not impose a limit on the number of iterations, and the program should iterate over all possible values of `i` up to `c // w1` or `c // w2` to ensure the correct maximum joy is found.

### Corrected Version:

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    c, h1, h2, w1, w2 = (int(t) for t in sys.stdin.readline().split())
    g = gcd(w1, w2)
    c //= g
    w1 //= g
    w2 //= g
    res = 0
    
    if c <= 10 ** 5 * w1:
        for i in range(c // w1 + 1):
            if res < i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2:
                res = i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2
    else:
        if c <= 10 ** 5 * w2:
            for i in range(c // w2 + 1):
                if res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) // w1 * h1:
                    res = i * h2 + (c - i * w2) // w1 * h1
        else:
            if h1 * w2 < h2 * w1:
                h1, h2 = h2, h1
                w1, w2 = w2, w1
            for i in range(c // w2 + 1):
                if res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) // w1 * h1:
                    res = i * h2 + (c - i * w2) // w1 * h1
            if h1 * w2 < h2 * w1:
                h1, h2 = h2, h1
                w1, w2 = w2, w1
    
    print(res)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly handle integer division and the range calculations, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected version ensures that all divisions are integer divisions and that the range calculations are correct, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
