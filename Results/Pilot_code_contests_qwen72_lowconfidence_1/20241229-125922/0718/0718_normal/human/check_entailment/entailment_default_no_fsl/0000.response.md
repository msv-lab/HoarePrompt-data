Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Integer Division Truncation**: The program uses integer division (`//`) implicitly through the `/` operator in Python 2, which can lead to truncation errors. For example, if `c - i * w1` is not perfectly divisible by `w2`, the result of `(c - i * w1) / w2` will be truncated, potentially leading to an incorrect calculation of the joy units.

2. **Handling Large Values**: The program attempts to handle large values of `c` by limiting the range of the loop to `10 ** 5`. However, this approach may not always find the optimal solution. For instance, if `c` is very large and the weights `w1` and `w2` are small, the optimal solution might require more than `10 ** 5` iterations, which the program will not consider.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle certain edge cases well. For example, if `w1` or `w2` is 1, the program's logic might not correctly compute the maximum joy units. Additionally, if `c` is very small, the program might not explore all possible combinations of red and blue candies.

4. **Incorrect Use of GCD**: The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the problem size. While this can simplify the problem, it does not guarantee that the optimal solution will be found, especially if the reduction is not handled correctly.

To ensure the program is correct for every potential case, it should:
- Use integer division explicitly (`//`).
- Consider all possible combinations of red and blue candies without arbitrary limits.
- Handle edge cases where `w1` or `w2` are 1 or `c` is very small.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for every potential case.
