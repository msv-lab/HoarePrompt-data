Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program has a limitation in its approach to solving the problem, which can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Here's a case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
10 3 5 2 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
16
```

### Actual Output:
The program outputs `16`, which is correct for this specific input. However, let's consider another input:

### Input:
```
1000000000 1 1 1 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
1000000000
```

### Actual Output:
The program outputs a smaller value because it limits the range of the loop to `10 ** 5` in some cases, which is not sufficient to cover the entire range of possible values for `c`.

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
for i in range(10 ** 5):
    if res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1:
        res = i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1
```

This loop only iterates up to `10 ** 5`, which is not enough to cover all possible values of `c` (up to `10 ** 9`). This means that for large values of `c`, the program may not find the optimal solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
