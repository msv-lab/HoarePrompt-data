Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the total capacity `c` is very large, specifically when `c > 10^5 * max(w1, w2)`. In this scenario, the program uses a fixed loop limit of `10^5`, which may not explore all possible combinations of red and blue candies that could yield the maximum joy. For example, consider the following input:

```
1000000000 1 1 1 1
```

Here, the total capacity `c` is 1,000,000,000 grams, and both types of candies weigh 1 gram each. The optimal solution would be to eat all 1,000,000,000 candies, resulting in 1,000,000,000 joy units. However, the program's loop only iterates up to `10^5`, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
