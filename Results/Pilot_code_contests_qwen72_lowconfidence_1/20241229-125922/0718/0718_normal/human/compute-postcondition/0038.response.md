The code assigns a new value to `res` using the expression `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies as follows:

- `i * h2` becomes `0 * h2` which is 0.
- `(c - i * w2)` becomes `c - 0 * w2` which simplifies to `c`.
- `c / w1 * h1` remains as `c / w1 * h1`.

Therefore, `res` is assigned the value of `c / w1 * h1`. The condition that `res` was less than `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1` is no longer valid since `res` now equals this expression.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `res` is `c / w1 * h1`**
