To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9.
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
- `res` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`.

### Loop Condition:
```
for i in range(c / w1 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop will execute if `range(c / w1 + 1)` is not empty. This means `c / w1 + 1` must be greater than 0.
2. **Condition for Non-Empty Range**: For `c / w1 + 1` to be greater than 0, `c / w1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is always true because `c` and `w1` are positive integers.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts from 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute as long as `c` and `w1` are positive integers, which they are according to the given constraints.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0.

### Final State:
- `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9.
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
- `res` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`.
- `i` is 0.

State: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is 0, the current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`, `i` is 0**
