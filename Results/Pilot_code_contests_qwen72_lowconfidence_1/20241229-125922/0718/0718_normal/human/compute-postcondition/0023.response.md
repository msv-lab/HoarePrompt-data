Postcondition: ***`C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\), `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\), `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\), `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\), `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\), `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `i` is 0. If `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is updated to \((c / w1) * h1\). Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
