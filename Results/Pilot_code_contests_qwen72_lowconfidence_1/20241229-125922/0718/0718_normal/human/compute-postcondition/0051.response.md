Functionality: ** The function `func` implicitly accepts five integer parameters `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, and `Wb`, each within the range 1 to 10^9, from standard input. It calculates the greatest possible value of a linear combination of two terms, where the coefficients and constants are derived from the input parameters. Specifically, it computes the maximum value of the expression \(i \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - i \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2\) or \(i \cdot h2 + \left( \frac{c - i \cdot w2}{w1} \right) \cdot h1\), depending on the conditions. The function prints this maximum value and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the following: `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, and `Wb` remain unchanged; `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, and `w2` are modified during computation but do not affect the global state outside the function; and the maximum value is printed to the console. Potential edge cases include when `c` is very large or when the division results in non-integer values, which could lead to truncation errors. **
