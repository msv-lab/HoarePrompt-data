To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, `g`, and `i` remain unchanged.
  - If `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is updated to `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.
- **For loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(c // w2 + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `c // w2` (inclusive).
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `c // w2`.

2. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, `g`) remain unchanged.
   - The value of `res` may change based on the condition inside the loop, but we are only concerned with the state before the loop body is executed.

### Adjusted State:
- **`i`** is incremented by 1.
- **`res`** remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless the condition inside the loop body changes it, but for the purpose of determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume it remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `C` remains unchanged.
- `Hr` remains unchanged.
- `Hb` remains unchanged.
- `Wr` remains unchanged.
- `Wb` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `h1` remains unchanged.
- `h2` remains unchanged.
- `w1` remains unchanged.
- `w2` remains unchanged.
- `g` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `res` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, `g` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**
