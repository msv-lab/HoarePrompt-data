The provided code snippet updates the value of `res` based on the current values of `i`, `h2`, `c`, `w2`, `w1`, and `h1`. Let's analyze the impact:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\).
   - `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\).
   - `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\).
   - `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\).
   - `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\).
   - `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\).
   - `h1` is an input integer.
   - `h2` is an input integer.
   - `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `g` is gcd(w1, w2).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `res` is 0 if the condition `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1` is not met.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet `res = i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1` calculates the new value of `res`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - `i * h2` is simply `h2` because `i` is 1.
   - `(c - i * w2) / w1` simplifies to `(c - w2) / w1`.
   - The final expression for `res` becomes `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

4. **Update `res`:**
   - `res` is updated to `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

5. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged.
   - `res` is now `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

Output State: **`C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\), `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\), `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\), `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\), `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\), `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `i` is 1, `res` is `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.**
