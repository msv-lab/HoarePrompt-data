The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature, but based on the given parameter constraints, it implicitly accepts five integer parameters: `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, and `Wb`, where each parameter is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so I cannot accurately describe the return value without additional information. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function computes some value or performs some operation using these parameters and returns a result.

Since the specific output is not provided, the most accurate description of the function's functionality is:

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts five integer parameters `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, and `Wb`, each within the range 1 to 10^9. The function's return value is not specified.**
