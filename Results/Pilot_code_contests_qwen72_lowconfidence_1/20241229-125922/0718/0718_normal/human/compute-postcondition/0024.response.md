To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\)
- `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\)
- `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\)
- `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\)
- `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\)
- `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\)
- `h1` is an input integer
- `h2` is an input integer
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`
- `g` is gcd(w1, w2)
- `i` is 0
- If `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is updated to \((c / w1) * h1\). Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(c / w2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `c / w2`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than or equal to `c / w2`.

### Updated State:
State: **`C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\), `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\), `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\), `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\), `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\), `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `i` is 1. If `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is updated to \((c / w1) * h1\). Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
