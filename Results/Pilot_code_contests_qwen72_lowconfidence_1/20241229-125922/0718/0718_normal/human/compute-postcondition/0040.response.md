According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `i < 10 ** 5`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `res` does not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`i` is 1, if `res` is less than `c / w1 * h1`, then `res` is set to `c / w1 * h1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
