The code snippet updates the value of `res`. Here’s the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9.
   - `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `h1` is an input integer.
   - `h2` is an input integer.
   - `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
   - `res` is either 0 or updated to `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`.
   - The current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The value of `res` is updated to `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - The expression `i * h1` simplifies to `h1`.
   - The expression `(c - i * w1)` simplifies to `c - w1`.
   - The expression `(c - w1) / w2` is the result of dividing `c - w1` by `w2`.
   - The final expression `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2` is calculated.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `res` is now `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` remain unchanged.
   - `c` remains an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `h1` remains an input integer.
   - `h2` remains an input integer.
   - `w1` remains an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `w2` remains an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `g` remains gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
   - `res` is now `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2`.
   - The current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`.
   - `i` is 1.

Output State: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2`, the current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`, `i` is 1**.
