The value of `res` is updated according to the expression `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `res` is calculated as follows:

- `i * h2` becomes `1 * h2`, which simplifies to `h2`.
- `(c - i * w2)` becomes `(c - 1 * w2)`, which simplifies to `(c - w2)`.
- `(c - w2) / w1` simplifies to `(c - w2) / w1`.
- Finally, `(c - w2) / w1 * h1` simplifies to `((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

Combining these, the new value of `res` is `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

However, the initial state specifies that if `res` is less than `c / w1 * h1`, then `res` is set to `c / w1 * h1`. This condition needs to be checked against the newly computed value of `res`.

If `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1` is less than `c / w1 * h1`, then `res` is set to `c / w1 * h1`. Otherwise, `res` remains as `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `res` is the maximum of `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1` and `c / w1 * h1`.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `res` is the maximum of `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1` and `c / w1 * h1`**.
