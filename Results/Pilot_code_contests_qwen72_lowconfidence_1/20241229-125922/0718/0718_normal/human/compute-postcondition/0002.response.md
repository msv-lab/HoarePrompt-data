The value of `c` is divided by `g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `w1` and `w2`. The other variables (`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer, `w2` is an input integer, `g` is gcd(w1, w2).

Output State: **C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer, `w2` is an input integer, `g` is gcd(w1, w2)**
