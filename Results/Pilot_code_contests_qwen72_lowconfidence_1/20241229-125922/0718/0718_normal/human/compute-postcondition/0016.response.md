Postcondition: ***`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\). `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`). `res` is either 0 or updated to \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \) if `res` is less than \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \). The current value of `c` is less than or equal to \( 10^5 \times w1 \), and `i` is 2. If `res` is less than \( 2 \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - 2 \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2 \), then `res` is updated to \( 2 \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - 2 \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2 \). Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
