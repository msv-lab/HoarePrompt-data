Postcondition: **C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\). `c` is an input integer divided by `g`. `h1` is an input integer. `h2` is an input integer. `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`. `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`. `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`). `res` is 0 initially. If `c` is less than or equal to \(10^5 \times w1\), `res` is the maximum value of the expression \(i \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - i \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2\) for \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w1} \right\rfloor\). If `c` is greater than \(10^5 \times w1\), and if \( c \leq 10^5 \times w2 \), then `res` is the maximum value of \( i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1 \) for all \( i \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w2} \right\rfloor \). Otherwise, if \( c > 10^5 \times w2 \), `res` is the maximum value of \( i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1 \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \(10^5 - 1\).**
