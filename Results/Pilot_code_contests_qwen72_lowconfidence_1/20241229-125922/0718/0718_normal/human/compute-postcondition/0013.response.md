Postcondition: ***`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is either 0 or updated to `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2` if `res` is less than `h1 + (c - w1) / w2 * h2`, the current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`, and `i` is 1.***
