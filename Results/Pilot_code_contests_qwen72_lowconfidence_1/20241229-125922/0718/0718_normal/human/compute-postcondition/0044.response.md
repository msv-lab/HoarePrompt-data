The code snippet assigns a new value to `res` based on the current value of `i` and other variables `h2`, `c`, `w2`, and `w1`. Given that `i` is 2, the new value of `res` will be calculated as follows:

- `res` = `i` * `h2` + (`c` - `i` * `w2`) / `w1` * `h1`
- Substituting `i` = 2, we get: `res` = 2 * `h2` + (`c` - 2 * `w2`) / `w1` * `h1`

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `res` = 2 * `h2` + (`c` - 2 * `w2`) / `w1` * `h1`.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `res` = 2 * `h2` + (`c` - 2 * `w2`) / `w1` * `h1`**
