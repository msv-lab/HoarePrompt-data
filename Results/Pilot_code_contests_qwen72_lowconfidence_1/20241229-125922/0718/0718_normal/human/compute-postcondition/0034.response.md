The code snippet `w1, w2 = w2, w1` swaps the values of `w1` and `w2`. Here’s the detailed impact:

- `w1` was originally an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` was originally another input integer divided by `g`.
- After the swap, `w1` now holds the value that `w2` had, and `w2` now holds the value that `w1` had.

The rest of the variables (`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `g`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is the original `h2`, `h2` is the original `h1`, `w1` is the original `w2` (input integer divided by `g`), `w2` is the original `w1` (input integer divided by `g`), `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `res` is 0, `c` is greater than 10, and `h2 * w2` is less than `h1 * w1`**.
