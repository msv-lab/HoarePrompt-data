To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step and understand how the variables change over time.

### Initial State:
- `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
- `res` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is less than or equal to \(10^5 \times w1\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(c // w1 + 1):
    if res < i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2:
        res = i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = c // w1`.
   - For each `i`, the expression `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2` is evaluated.
   - If this expression is greater than the current value of `res`, `res` is updated to this new value.

2. **Final Value of `res`**:
   - After the loop finishes, `res` will hold the maximum value of the expression `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) // w2 * h2` for all `i` in the range `[0, c // w1]`.

3. **Variables**:
   - `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, and `g` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - `res` will be updated to the maximum value of the expression mentioned above.

### Output State:
- `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
- `res` is the maximum value of the expression \(i \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - i \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2\) for \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w1} \right\rfloor\).
- The current value of `c` is less than or equal to \(10^5 \times w1\).

Output State: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\). `c` is an input integer divided by `g`. `h1` is an input integer. `h2` is an input integer. `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`. `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`. `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`). `res` is the maximum value of the expression \(i \cdot h1 + \left( \frac{c - i \cdot w1}{w2} \right) \cdot h2\) for \(0 \leq i \leq \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w1} \right\rfloor\). The current value of `c` is less than or equal to \(10^5 \times w1\).**
