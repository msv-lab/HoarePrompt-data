The value of `res` is updated to the result of the expression `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`. Given the initial conditions, this means:

- `res` is now equal to `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`.
- All other variables (`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, `g`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`, the current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `res` is less than `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2` (note that this condition no longer holds as `res` is now equal to this value).**
