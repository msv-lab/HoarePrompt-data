Postcondition: ***C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c\), `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `res` is 0, and `c` is greater than 10. If \( c \leq 10^5 \times w2 \), then `i` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w2} \right\rfloor + 1 \) and `res` is the maximum value of \( i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1 \) for all \( i \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( \left\lfloor \frac{c}{w2} \right\rfloor \). Otherwise, `i` is \(10^5 - 1\) and `res` is the maximum value of \( i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1 \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \(10^5 - 1\), where `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, and `w2` are the original values, and `w1` and `w2` may have been swapped based on the initial condition.***
