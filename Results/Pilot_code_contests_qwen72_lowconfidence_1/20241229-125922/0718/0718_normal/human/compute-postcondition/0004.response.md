The code snippet `w2 /= g` updates the value of `w2` by dividing it by `g`. The other variables (`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `g`) remain unchanged.

- `w2` was initially an input integer, and now it is updated to `w2 / g`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2)**.

Output State: **C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2)**.
