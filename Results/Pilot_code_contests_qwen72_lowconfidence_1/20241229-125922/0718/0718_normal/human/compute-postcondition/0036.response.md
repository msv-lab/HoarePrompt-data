To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(10 ** 5):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This loop will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to \(10^5 - 1\). This means the loop will always execute at least once because the range function will generate a sequence of 100,000 numbers starting from 0.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initialization of the loop variable `i`. The other variables (`C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb, c, h1, h2, w1, w2, g, res`) do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Loop Variable Initialization**: The loop variable `i` must be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb, c, h1, h2, w1, w2, g, res`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They are part of the program state but do not influence the loop's ability to run.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:

State: **`i` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The other variables remain as they are described in the initial state.
