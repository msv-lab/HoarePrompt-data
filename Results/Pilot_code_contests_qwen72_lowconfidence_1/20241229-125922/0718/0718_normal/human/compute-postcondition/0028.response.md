The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The new value of `res` is calculated as `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`. The values of `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, and `g` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, `g` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`**.
