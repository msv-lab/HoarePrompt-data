To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(c // w2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Range of the Loop**:
   - The loop will execute if the range is non-empty.
   - The range is defined as `range(c // w2 + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `c // w2 + 1` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition for Non-Empty Range**:
   - `c // w2 + 1 > 0`
   - Simplifying this, we get `c // w2 >= 0`.
   - Since `c` and `w2` are both positive integers (as per the constraints), `c // w2` will always be a non-negative integer.
   - Therefore, `c // w2 + 1` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute at least once.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from 0.
   - We need to ensure that `c` and `w2` are such that the loop condition holds true.

Given the initial state:
- `C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(w1, w2).
- `res` is 0.
- `c` is greater than 10 and less than or equal to \(10^5 \times w2\).

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute at least once because `c // w2 + 1` will always be greater than 0.
- We need to ensure that `i` starts from 0.
- The value of `c` must be within the specified range to ensure the loop condition holds.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`C` is an integer such that \(1 \leq C \leq 10^9\), `Hr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hr \leq 10^9\), `Hb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Hb \leq 10^9\), `Wr` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wr \leq 10^9\), `Wb` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an integer such that \(10 < c \leq 10^5 \times w2\), `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `res` is 0, `i` is 0**.
