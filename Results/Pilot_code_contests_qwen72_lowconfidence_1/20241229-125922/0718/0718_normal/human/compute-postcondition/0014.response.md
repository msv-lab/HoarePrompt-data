To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\).
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
- `res` is either 0 or updated to \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \) if `res` is less than \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \).
- The current value of `c` is less than or equal to \( 10^5 \times w1 \).
- `i` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(c // w1 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `c // w1 + 1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- Ensure that the new value of `i` is still less than `c // w1 + 1`.

### Calculation:
- Current value of `i` is 1.
- Next value of `i` will be 2.
- The loop will continue to execute if \( 2 < c // w1 + 1 \).

### Final State:
- `i` is 2.
- The condition \( 2 < c // w1 + 1 \) must hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

### State:
**`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that \(1 \leq C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb \leq 10^9\), `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is either 0 or updated to \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \) if `res` is less than \( h1 + \left( \frac{c - w1}{w2} \right) \times h2 \), the current value of `c` is less than or equal to \( 10^5 \times w1 \), and `i` is 2.**
