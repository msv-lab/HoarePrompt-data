The code snippet swaps the values of `h1` and `h2`. Given the initial state:

- `h1` is an input integer.
- `h2` is an input integer.
- `h1 * w2` is less than `h2 * w1`.

After the swap, the new values of `h1` and `h2` are:

- `h1` now holds the value of `h2`.
- `h2` now holds the value of `h1`.

Therefore, the condition `h1 * w2` is less than `h2 * w1` will no longer be valid in terms of the original values of `h1` and `h2`, but will be valid with the new values.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged:

- `C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109.
- `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
- `g` is gcd(w1, w2).
- `res` is 0.
- `c` is greater than 10.
- The new condition is that `h2 * w2` is less than `h1 * w1`.

Output State: **`C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is the original `h2`, `h2` is the original `h1`, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `res` is 0, `c` is greater than 10, and `h2 * w2` is less than `h1 * w1`**.
