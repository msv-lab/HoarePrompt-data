The value of `g` is assigned the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `w1` and `w2`. The values of `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, and `w2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer, `w2` is an input integer, `g` is gcd(w1, w2)**
