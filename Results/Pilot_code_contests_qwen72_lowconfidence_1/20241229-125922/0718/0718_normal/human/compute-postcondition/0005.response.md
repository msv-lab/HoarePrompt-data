The variable `res` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the values of `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, or `g`. Therefore, the Output State is:

**C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 ≤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb ≤ 109, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(w1, w2), `res` is 0.**
