Postcondition: ***`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb`, `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, and `g` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1. If `res < i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is updated to `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`. Otherwise, `res` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.***
