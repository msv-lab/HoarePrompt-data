To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(c / w1 + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `c / w1 + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9.
   - `c` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `h1` is an input integer.
   - `h2` is an input integer.
   - `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`.
   - `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`).
   - `res` is either 0 or updated to `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`.
   - The current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `c / w1 + 1`.

Given that `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `c / w1 + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 1.
- All other variables remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` are integers such that 1 ≤ `C`, `Hr`, `Hb`, `Wr`, `Wb` ≤ 10^9, `c` is an input integer divided by `g`, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer divided by `g`, `w2` is an input integer divided by `g`, `g` is gcd(`w1`, `w2`), `res` is either 0 or updated to `i * h1 + (c - i * w1) / w2 * h2`, the current value of `c` is less than or equal to 10^5 * `w1`, and `i` is 1**.
