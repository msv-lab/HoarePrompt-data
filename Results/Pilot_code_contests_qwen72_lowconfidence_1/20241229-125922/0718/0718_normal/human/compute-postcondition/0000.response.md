The provided Python code reads a line from standard input and splits it into five parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `c`, `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, and `w2`.

Output State: **C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb are integers such that 1 â‰¤ C, Hr, Hb, Wr, Wb â‰¤ 109, `c` is an input integer, `h1` is an input integer, `h2` is an input integer, `w1` is an input integer, `w2` is an input integer**
