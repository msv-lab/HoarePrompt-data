To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `i` is 1.
- The condition for adjusting `res` is: if `res` is less than `i * h2 + (c - i * w2) / w1 * h1`, then `res` is set to the maximum of `h2 + ((c - w2) / w1) * h1` and `c / w1 * h1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(10 ** 5):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `10 ** 5`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
4. **Condition Check**: The condition for adjusting `res` will be re-evaluated with the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 2.
- The condition for adjusting `res` will be re-evaluated using `i = 2`.

Since the exact values of `h1`, `h2`, `w1`, `w2`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` at this point. However, the condition for adjusting `res` will be checked again with the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, and the condition for adjusting `res` will be re-evaluated with the new value of `i`**.
