Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input number `n` consists entirely of zeros. According to the problem description, the number `n` should not have leading zeros, but if `n` is "0", the program should still correctly handle this edge case. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example:

- Input:
  ```
  0
  0
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  OK
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  WRONG_ANSWER
  ```

This is because the program attempts to swap the first non-zero digit with the first digit, but since there are no non-zero digits, it incorrectly compares the lists and concludes that the answer is wrong. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific edge case.
