You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One cold winter evening Alice and her older brother Bob was sitting at home near the fireplace and giving each other interesting problems to solve. When it was Alice's turn, she told the number n to Bob and said:

—Shuffle the digits in this number in order to obtain the smallest possible number without leading zeroes.

—No problem! — said Bob and immediately gave her an answer.

Alice said a random number, so she doesn't know whether Bob's answer is correct. Help her to find this out, because impatient brother is waiting for the verdict.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) without leading zeroes. The second lines contains one integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ 109) — Bob's answer, possibly with leading zeroes.

Output

Print OK if Bob's answer is correct and WRONG_ANSWER otherwise.

Program:
```
def func():
    I = raw_input
    n = I()
    m = I()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
    if n[i] != '0':
        (n[0], n[i]) = (n[i], n[0])
    print['OK', 'WRONG_ANSWER'][n != list(m)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input`**: In Python 3, `raw_input` has been replaced by `input`. Using `raw_input` will cause a `NameError` in Python 3 environments.

2. **Handling of Leading Zeroes**: The program attempts to move the first non-zero digit to the front to avoid leading zeroes. However, the logic is flawed. For example, if the input number `n` is `100`, the program will incorrectly move the first non-zero digit to the front, resulting in `0100` instead of `100`.

3. **List Comparison**: The comparison `n != list(m)` is used to check if the shuffled number matches Bob's answer. This comparison is incorrect because `n` is a list of characters, and `m` is a string. The correct comparison should be between two strings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = input().strip()
    m = input().strip()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    
    # Move the first non-zero digit to the front
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
    n[0], n[i] = n[i], n[0]
    
    # Join the list back into a string
    n = ''.join(n)
    
    print('OK' if n == m else 'WRONG_ANSWER')
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two inputs implicitly or through global variables: `n` and `m`. `n` is an integer where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 without leading zeroes, and `m` is an integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 which may include leading zeroes.
def func():
    I = raw_input
    n = I()
    m = I()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, `i` is the index of the first character in `n` that is not '0'. If all characters in `n` are '0', `i` is `len(n)`.
    if (n[i] != '0') :
        n[0], n[i] = n[i], n[0]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, and `i` is the index of the first character in `n` that is not '0'. If all characters in `n` are '0', `i` is `len(n)`. If `n[i]` is not '0', `n[0]` is the character at index `i` before the swap, and `n[i]` is the character that was originally at `n[0]`. Otherwise, the list `n` remains unchanged.
    print['OK', 'WRONG_ANSWER'][n != list(m)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two lines of input, where the first line represents an integer `n` (without leading zeroes) and the second line represents an integer `m` (which may have leading zeroes). It then processes `n` by converting it into a list of characters, sorting this list, and swapping the first non-zero character with the first character of the list if it is not already the first character. After processing, it compares the modified list of characters of `n` with the list of characters of `m`. If the lists match, it prints "OK"; otherwise, it prints "WRONG_ANSWER". The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` consists entirely of zeros, in which case no swap occurs, and when `n` and `m` are identical strings, leading to "OK" being printed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
