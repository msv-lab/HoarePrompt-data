Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The logic to move the first non-zero digit to the front of the number is flawed. Specifically, the line `(n[0], n[i]) = (n[i], n[0])` swaps the first character with the first non-zero character, but it does not handle cases where the first non-zero digit is already at the beginning.

2. **Comparison with Bob's Answer**: The comparison `n != list(m)` is incorrect because it compares lists directly, which may not account for the fact that Bob's answer might have leading zeros.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

- Input:
  ```
  100
  001
  ```
  Expected Output:
  ```
  OK
  ```
  Actual Output:
  ```
  WRONG_ANSWER
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly identifies Bob's answer as wrong because it does not properly handle leading zeros in Bob's answer.
