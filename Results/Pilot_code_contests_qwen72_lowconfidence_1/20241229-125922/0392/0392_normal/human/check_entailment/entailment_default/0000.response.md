Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the code fails to handle the case where the number `n` consists entirely of zeros. In such a case, the code will incorrectly swap the first zero with itself, leading to an incorrect comparison with `m`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
0000
0000
```
The correct answer should be "OK" because the smallest possible number without leading zeroes is "0", and Bob's answer "0000" (which is effectively "0") is correct. However, the provided code will not swap any digits and will compare `n` (which remains as a list of zeros) with `m` (also a list of zeros), leading to a correct comparison. This specific case might seem to work, but the logic of the code is flawed because it does not handle the edge case where `n` consists entirely of zeros.

Additionally, the code uses `raw_input`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, you should use `input` instead. This is not a correctness issue but a compatibility issue that should be noted.

Therefore, the code is incorrect due to the edge case where `n` consists entirely of zeros.
