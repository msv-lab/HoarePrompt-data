You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: One cold winter evening Alice and her older brother Bob was sitting at home near the fireplace and giving each other interesting problems to solve. When it was Alice's turn, she told the number n to Bob and said:

—Shuffle the digits in this number in order to obtain the smallest possible number without leading zeroes.

—No problem! — said Bob and immediately gave her an answer.

Alice said a random number, so she doesn't know whether Bob's answer is correct. Help her to find this out, because impatient brother is waiting for the verdict.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 109) without leading zeroes. The second lines contains one integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ 109) — Bob's answer, possibly with leading zeroes.

Output

Print OK if Bob's answer is correct and WRONG_ANSWER otherwise.

Examples

Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two inputs implicitly or through global variables: `n` and `m`. `n` is an integer where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 without leading zeroes, and `m` is an integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 which may include leading zeroes.
def func():
    I = raw_input
    n = I()
    m = I()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, `i` is the index of the first character in `n` that is not '0'. If all characters in `n` are '0', `i` is `len(n)`.
    if (n[i] != '0') :
        n[0], n[i] = n[i], n[0]
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, and `i` is the index of the first character in `n` that is not '0'. If all characters in `n` are '0', `i` is `len(n)`. If `n[i]` is not '0', `n[0]` is the character at index `i` before the swap, and `n[i]` is the character that was originally at `n[0]`. Otherwise, the list `n` remains unchanged.
    print['OK', 'WRONG_ANSWER'][n != list(m)]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two lines of input, where the first line represents an integer `n` (without leading zeroes) and the second line represents an integer `m` (which may have leading zeroes). It then processes `n` by converting it into a list of characters, sorting this list, and swapping the first non-zero character with the first character of the list if it is not already the first character. After processing, it compares the modified list of characters of `n` with the list of characters of `m`. If the lists match, it prints "OK"; otherwise, it prints "WRONG_ANSWER". The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` consists entirely of zeros, in which case no swap occurs, and when `n` and `m` are identical strings, leading to "OK" being printed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
