Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly follows the problem description and performs the required tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads two inputs, `n` and `m`, using `raw_input` (which should be `input` in Python 3, but we assume the environment is Python 2 for this analysis).

2. **Processing `n`**:
   - The program converts `n` to a list of characters and sorts it.
   - It then finds the first non-zero digit in the sorted list and swaps it with the first element of the list to ensure there are no leading zeros in the resulting number.
   - If all digits in `n` are zeros, no swap is performed, which is correct because the smallest number with all zeros is "0".

3. **Comparison with `m`**:
   - The program converts `m` to a list of characters.
   - It then compares the modified list of characters of `n` with the list of characters of `m`.
   - If the lists match, it prints "OK"; otherwise, it prints "WRONG_ANSWER".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All Zeros**: If `n` consists entirely of zeros, the program correctly handles this case by not performing any swap and comparing the list of zeros with `m`.
   - **Identical Strings**: If `n` and `m` are identical strings, the program correctly prints "OK".
   - **Valid Input**: The program assumes valid input and does not handle invalid cases (e.g., non-integer inputs), which is consistent with the problem description's assumption of valid input.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
