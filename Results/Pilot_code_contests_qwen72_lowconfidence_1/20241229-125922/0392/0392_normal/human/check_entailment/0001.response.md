Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that make it incorrect for certain cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input`**: In Python 3, `raw_input` has been replaced by `input`. Using `raw_input` will cause a `NameError` in Python 3 environments.

2. **Handling of Leading Zeroes**: The program attempts to move the first non-zero digit to the front to avoid leading zeroes. However, the logic is flawed. For example, if the input number `n` is `100`, the program will incorrectly move the first non-zero digit to the front, resulting in `0100` instead of `100`.

3. **List Comparison**: The comparison `n != list(m)` is used to check if the shuffled number matches Bob's answer. This comparison is incorrect because `n` is a list of characters, and `m` is a string. The correct comparison should be between two strings.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = input().strip()
    m = input().strip()
    n = sorted(list(n))
    
    # Move the first non-zero digit to the front
    for i in range(len(n)):
        if n[i] != '0':
            break
    n[0], n[i] = n[i], n[0]
    
    # Join the list back into a string
    n = ''.join(n)
    
    print('OK' if n == m else 'WRONG_ANSWER')
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly for all valid inputs.
