Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not fully meet the requirements as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input`**: The function uses `raw_input`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input` should be used instead. This can cause compatibility issues depending on the environment in which the code is run.

2. **Handling of Leading Zeroes**: The logic for handling leading zeroes is flawed. The program correctly identifies the first non-zero digit and swaps it with the first digit. However, after the swap, it does not properly form the smallest possible number without leading zeroes. For example, if the input is `3010`, the program will output `1003`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1003`.

3. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison logic at the end of the program is incorrect. It compares the list `n` directly with the list `m`. This will not work as expected because `n` is a list of characters, and `m` is a string. The correct approach would be to join the list `n` into a string and then compare it with `m`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
def func():
    n = input().strip()
    m = input().strip()
    
    # Convert n to a list of characters and sort it
    n_list = sorted(list(n))
    
    # Move the first non-zero digit to the front
    for i in range(len(n_list)):
        if n_list[i] != '0':
            n_list[0], n_list[i] = n_list[i], n_list[0]
            break
    
    # Join the list back into a string
    n_sorted = ''.join(n_list)
    
    # Compare the sorted number with Bob's answer
    if n_sorted == m:
        print('OK')
    else:
        print('WRONG_ANSWER')

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `input()` and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
2. **Sorting and Swapping**: It converts the number `n` to a list of characters, sorts it, and then moves the first non-zero digit to the front to avoid leading zeroes.
3. **Comparison**: It joins the list back into a string and compares it with Bob's answer `m`.
4. **Output**: It prints 'OK' if the numbers match, otherwise it prints 'WRONG_ANSWER'.

This corrected program ensures that it always produces the correct output according to the problem description.
