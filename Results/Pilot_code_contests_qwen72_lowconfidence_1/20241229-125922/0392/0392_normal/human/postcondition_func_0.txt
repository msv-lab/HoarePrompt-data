The function `func` reads two lines of input, where the first line represents an integer `n` (without leading zeroes) and the second line represents an integer `m` (which may have leading zeroes). It then processes `n` by converting it into a list of characters, sorting this list, and swapping the first non-zero character with the first character of the list if it is not already the first character. After processing, it compares the modified list of characters of `n` with the list of characters of `m`. If the lists match, it prints "OK"; otherwise, it prints "WRONG_ANSWER". The function does not return any value. Edge cases include when `n` consists entirely of zeros, in which case no swap occurs, and when `n` and `m` are identical strings, leading to "OK" being printed.
