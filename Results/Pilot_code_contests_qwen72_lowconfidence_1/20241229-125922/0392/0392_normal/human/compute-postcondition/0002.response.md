The value of `m` is now the result of calling the `I()` function, which is equivalent to `raw_input()`. Since `n` was also assigned the value from `I()`, both `n` and `m` will now hold the same string value obtained from user input. The initial condition that `m` is an integer with 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 which may include leading zeroes is no longer valid since `m` is now a string.

Output State: **`n` is a string value from `I()`, `m` is a string value from `I()`, `I` is the `raw_input` function.**
