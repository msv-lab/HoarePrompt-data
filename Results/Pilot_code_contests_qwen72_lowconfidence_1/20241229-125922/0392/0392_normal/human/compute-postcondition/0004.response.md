To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order.
- `m` is a string value from `I()`.
- `I` is the `raw_input` function (which in Python 3 is equivalent to `input`).

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(n)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is a list of characters from a string obtained from the `I()` function, and this list is sorted.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must contain at least one element. If `n` is empty, `len(n)` will be 0, and the loop will not execute.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop index, which will start at 0 and iterate up to `len(n) - 1`.

3. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is a string value from `I()`, but it does not directly affect the loop's execution. It is not used in the loop condition or initialization.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `n` must have at least one element. Therefore, the string value from `I()` must not be an empty string after sorting and converting to a list.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a non-empty list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, `i` is 0**
