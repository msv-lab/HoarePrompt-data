Postcondition: ***`n` is a list of characters from the string value from `I()` in sorted order, `m` is a string value from `I()`, and `i` is the index of the first character in `n` that is not '0'. If all characters in `n` are '0', `i` is `len(n)`. If `n[i]` is not '0', `n[0]` is the character at index `i` before the swap, and `n[i]` is the character that was originally at `n[0]`. Otherwise, the list `n` remains unchanged.***
