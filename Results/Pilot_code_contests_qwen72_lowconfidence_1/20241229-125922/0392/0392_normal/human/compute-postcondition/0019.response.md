The function `func` implicitly or through global variables takes two inputs: `n` and `m`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 without leading zeroes, and `m` is an integer with the constraint 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 which may include leading zeroes. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function implicitly or through global variables takes two integers `n` and `m`, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 without leading zeroes, and 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^9 which may include leading zeroes. The function does not return any value.**
