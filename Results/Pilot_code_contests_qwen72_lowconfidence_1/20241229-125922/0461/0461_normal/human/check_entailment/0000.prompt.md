You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For some reason in many American cartoons anvils fall from time to time onto heroes' heads. Of course, safes, wardrobes, cruisers, planes fall sometimes too... But anvils do so most of all.

Anvils come in different sizes and shapes. Quite often they get the hero stuck deep in the ground. But have you ever thought who throws anvils from the sky? From what height? We are sure that such questions have never troubled you!

It turns out that throwing an anvil properly is not an easy task at all. Let's describe one of the most popular anvil throwing models.

Let the height p of the potential victim vary in the range [0;a] and the direction of the wind q vary in the range [ - b;b]. p and q could be any real (floating) numbers. Then we can assume that the anvil will fit the toon's head perfectly only if the following equation has at least one real root: 

<image>

Determine the probability with which an aim can be successfully hit by an anvil.

You can assume that the p and q coefficients are chosen equiprobably and independently in their ranges.

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — amount of testcases.

Each of the following t lines contain two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Pretests contain all the tests with 0 < a < 10, 0 ≤ b < 10.

Output

Print t lines — the probability of a successful anvil hit for each testcase. The absolute or relative error of the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

Examples

Input

2
4 2
1 2


Output

0.6250000000
0.5312500000
Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(0, t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if b == 0:
            print(1)
            continue
        if a == 0:
            print(0.5)
            continue
        p = a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b
        q = a * 2 * b
        a = min(a, 4 * b)
        p = p + a * a / 8.0
        print(p / (1.0 * q))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
