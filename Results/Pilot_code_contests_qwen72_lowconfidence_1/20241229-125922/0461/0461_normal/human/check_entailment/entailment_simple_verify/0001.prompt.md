You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: For some reason in many American cartoons anvils fall from time to time onto heroes' heads. Of course, safes, wardrobes, cruisers, planes fall sometimes too... But anvils do so most of all.

Anvils come in different sizes and shapes. Quite often they get the hero stuck deep in the ground. But have you ever thought who throws anvils from the sky? From what height? We are sure that such questions have never troubled you!

It turns out that throwing an anvil properly is not an easy task at all. Let's describe one of the most popular anvil throwing models.

Let the height p of the potential victim vary in the range [0;a] and the direction of the wind q vary in the range [ - b;b]. p and q could be any real (floating) numbers. Then we can assume that the anvil will fit the toon's head perfectly only if the following equation has at least one real root: 

<image>

Determine the probability with which an aim can be successfully hit by an anvil.

You can assume that the p and q coefficients are chosen equiprobably and independently in their ranges.

Input

The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10000) — amount of testcases.

Each of the following t lines contain two space-separated integers a and b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 106).

Pretests contain all the tests with 0 < a < 10, 0 ≤ b < 10.

Output

Print t lines — the probability of a successful anvil hit for each testcase. The absolute or relative error of the answer should not exceed 10 - 6.

    t = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(0, t):
        (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
        if b == 0:
            print(1)
            continue
        if a == 0:
            print(0.5)
            continue
        p = a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b
        q = a * 2 * b
        a = min(a, 4 * b)
        p = p + a * a / 8.0
        print(p / (1.0 * q))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical issue in how it calculates the probability of a successful anvil hit. Specifically, the calculation of `p` and `q` and the final probability does not match the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization of `p` and `q`:**
   - `p` is calculated as `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b`.
   - `q` is calculated as `a * 2 * b`.

2. **Adjustment of `a`:**
   - `a` is set to `min(a, 4 * b)`.

3. **Final adjustment of `p`:**
   - `p` is adjusted by adding `a * a / 8.0`.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability is calculated as `p / (1.0 * q)`.

However, the problem description requires the probability of the equation having at least one real root. The equation given in the problem is:

\[ p^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (b^2 - q) \geq 0 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ p^2 - 4b^2 + 4q \geq 0 \]
\[ p^2 + 4q \geq 4b^2 \]

The probability of this inequality holding true needs to be calculated over the ranges of \( p \) and \( q \). The current program does not correctly implement this logic.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `a = 4` and `b = 2`. According to the problem description, the probability should be calculated based on the inequality:

\[ p^2 + 4q \geq 4b^2 \]

For \( p \in [0, 4] \) and \( q \in [-2, 2] \):

- The area where the inequality holds can be visualized and calculated.
- The program's output for this case is `0.6250000000`, but the correct probability should be different based on the correct geometric interpretation of the inequality.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the probability calculation for all potential cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(0, t):
        a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        if b == 0:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if a == 0:
            print(0.5)
            continue
        
        p = a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b
        
        q = a * 2 * b
        
        a = min(a, 4 * b)
        
        p = p + a * a / 8.0
        
        print(p / (1.0 * q))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is `t - 1`, `a` and `b` are the values read from the user during the last iteration, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`, and the loop has printed a value for each of the `t` test cases, either 1, 0.5, or the result of `p / (1.0 * q)`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
