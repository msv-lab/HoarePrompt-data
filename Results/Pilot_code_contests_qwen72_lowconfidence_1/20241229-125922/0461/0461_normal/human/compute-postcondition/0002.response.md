The code snippet `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits the line into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000
- `i` is 0

After executing the code:
- `a` is assigned the first integer from the user input
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the user input
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000
- `i` remains 0

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer from user input, `b` is the second integer from user input**
