Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`. If `b` == 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `a` == 0, the values of `p` and `q` remain unchanged.**
