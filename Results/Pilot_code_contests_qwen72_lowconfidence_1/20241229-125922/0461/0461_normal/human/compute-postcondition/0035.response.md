The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables during this iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`. If `b` == 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.
