Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer from user input, `b` is the second integer from user input, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b`. If `a` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration if `b` is 0.**
