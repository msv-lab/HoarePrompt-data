The code snippet `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. This operation changes the values of `a` and `b` from their initial conditions.

- The initial value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The initial value of `i` remains 2.
- The new value of `a` is the first integer input by the user.
- The new value of `b` is the second integer input by the user.
- The initial value of `p` and `q` are dependent on the new values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`, if `a` == 0, 0.5 is printed to the console, if `b` == 0, 1 is printed to the console, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
