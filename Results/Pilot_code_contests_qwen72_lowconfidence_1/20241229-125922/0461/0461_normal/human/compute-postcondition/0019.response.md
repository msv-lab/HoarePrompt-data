The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Since no loop is explicitly shown in the provided context, we assume this `continue` statement is part of an implied loop (such as a for or while loop). The variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q` retain their values as the `continue` statement does not modify them. The number 1 has already been printed to the console, and this action is not reversed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`, the number 1 is printed to the console, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
