The provided Python code reads two integers from the user and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This impacts the initial state where `a` and `b` were defined in terms of user inputs and certain operations.

- The initial state specifies that `a` is defined as `min(a, 4 * b)`, and `b` is the second integer from user input.
- After the code `a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())` is executed, `a` and `b` are directly assigned new values from the user input, overriding their previous definitions.

Since the new values of `a` and `b` are now directly from user input, the conditions `1 ≤ t ≤ 10000` for `t` and the initial expressions for `a` and `b` are no longer relevant to the current state. However, the values of `p` and `q` depend on the new values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `a` and `b` are now the two integers input by the user.
- `p` and `q` are not recalculated in this snippet, so they retain their initial expressions: `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, and `q` is `a * 2 * b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`.**
