Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`. If `b` == 0, the number 1 is printed to the console, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
