The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the provided context, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the described task. The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. Given the typical structure of such functions, we can infer that the function likely accepts the number of test cases `t` and the pairs of integers `a` and `b` for each test case. However, since the function signature does not explicitly show these parameters, we will describe the functionality based on the implied parameters.

The function is designed to process `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b` (with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000 and 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6). For each test case, the function computes some result based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Since the specific output is not provided in the problem statement, I will assume a common scenario where the function might return the sum of `a` and `b` for each test case. However, the exact computation could vary based on the actual implementation.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `a` and `b`. It returns a list of results, where each result is computed based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.** 

If you can provide more specific details about the output, I can refine the description accordingly.
