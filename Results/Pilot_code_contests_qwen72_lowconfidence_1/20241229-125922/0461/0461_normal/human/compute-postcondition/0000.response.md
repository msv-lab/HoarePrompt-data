The value of `t` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means `t` now holds the integer value input by the user. The constraints for `t` remain 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000. The conditions for `a` and `b` (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6) for each of the t test cases remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^6.**
