The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by this statement. However, the control flow is affected, meaning the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is the second integer from user input. If `b` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.**
