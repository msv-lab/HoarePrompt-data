The code snippet `print(1)` prints the number 1 to the console. This operation does not affect any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer from user input, `b` is the second integer from user input, and the current value of `b` is 0**
