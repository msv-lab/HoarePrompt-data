The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no further code within the same iteration of the loop will be executed, and the loop control is transferred back to the start of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. However, the print statements that would normally execute in the current iteration of the loop (if `a` == 0, 0.5 is printed; if `b` == 0, 1 is printed; and 1 is printed at the end) are skipped due to the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input by the user, `b` is the second integer input by the user, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b + a * a / 8.0`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
