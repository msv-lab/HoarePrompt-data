According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1 and less than or equal to 10000. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0 to ensure the loop can begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0**
