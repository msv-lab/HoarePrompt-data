The value of `a` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `4 * b`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, as does the value of `t`, `i`, `p`, and `q`.

Let's consider the possible outcomes:

- If `a` is less than or equal to `4 * b`, `a` remains unchanged.
- If `a` is greater than `4 * b`, `a` is set to `4 * b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only express the updated value of `a` in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10000, `i` is 0, `a` is `min(a, 4 * b)`, `b` is the second integer from user input, `p` is `a * b + max(a - 4 * b, 0) * b`, `q` is `a * 2 * b`**
