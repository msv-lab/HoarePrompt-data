The function reads two pairs of integers from the user, `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100. The function then checks if `b` is equal to `d`. If they are equal, the function prints `b` and terminates. If `b` is not equal to `d`, the function calculates a value `t` as `d - b` and iterates over a range of values determined by the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. For each value `x` in this range, the function checks if `(a * x - t) % c == 0`. If such an `x` is found, the function prints `b + a * x` and terminates. If no such `x` is found, the function prints `-1` and terminates. The function does not return any value; it only prints to the console and exits.
