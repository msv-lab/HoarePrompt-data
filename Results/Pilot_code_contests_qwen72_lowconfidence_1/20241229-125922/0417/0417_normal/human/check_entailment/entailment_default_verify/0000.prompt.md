You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Examples

Input

20 2
9 19


Output

82


Input

2 1
16 12


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if b == d:
        print(b)
        sys.exit()
    t = d - b
    for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
        if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
            print(b + a * x)
            sys.exit()
    print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `c` are both 1, and `b` and `d` are different. For example, if the input is:

```
1 2
1 3
```

Rick will scream at times 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and Morty will scream at times 3, 4, 5, 6, .... They will first scream at the same time at time 3. However, the program will not output 3; instead, it will output -1, which is incorrect according to the problem description. This indicates that the program fails to correctly identify the first common scream time in this specific scenario.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads two pairs of integers from the user, `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100. The function then checks if `b` is equal to `d`. If they are equal, the function prints `b` and terminates. If `b` is not equal to `d`, the function calculates a value `t` as `d - b` and iterates over a range of values determined by the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. For each value `x` in this range, the function checks if `(a * x - t) % c == 0`. If such an `x` is found, the function prints `b + a * x` and terminates. If no such `x` is found, the function prints `-1` and terminates. The function does not return any value; it only prints to the console and exits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
