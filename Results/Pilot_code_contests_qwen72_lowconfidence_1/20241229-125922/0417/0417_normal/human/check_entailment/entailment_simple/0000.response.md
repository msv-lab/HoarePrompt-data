**Correctness: False**

### Explanation:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of finding the first time Rick and Morty scream at the same time, or determining that they will never scream at the same time. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since the problem description does not specify which version of Python to use, it is safer to assume Python 3, making the use of `raw_input()` incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11` is not well-defined and may not correctly cover all potential cases. The logic here is flawed because it does not ensure that the loop will terminate in a reasonable number of iterations for all possible inputs. A more appropriate approach would be to use a loop that continues until a solution is found or it is determined that no solution exists.

3. **Logic for Finding the First Common Scream Time**: The logic inside the loop `if (a * x - t) % c == 0:` is attempting to find the first common time, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly for all cases. For example, if `a` and `c` are not coprime (i.e., they have a common divisor greater than 1), this logic might miss some valid solutions.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `a` and `c` are both 1, the loop will run indefinitely unless a solution is found very quickly. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where `a` and `c` are such that they will never intersect (e.g., `a = 2`, `b = 1`, `c = 4`, `d = 2`).

### Correct Approach:

A more robust approach to solve this problem would be to use the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) to determine if and when the two sequences intersect. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def find_first_common_scream(a, b, c, d):
    # Calculate the difference between the initial times
    t = d - b
    
    # Find the least common multiple (LCM) of a and c
    lcm = a * c // math.gcd(a, c)
    
    # Check if there is a common time
    if t % math.gcd(a, c) == 0:
        x = t // c
        return b + a * x
    else:
        return -1

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())
c, d = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the result
print(find_first_common_scream(a, b, c, d))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Calculate the Difference**: `t = d - b` calculates the difference between the initial times when Rick and Morty start screaming.
2. **Find the LCM**: `lcm = a * c // math.gcd(a, c)` calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `c`.
3. **Check for Common Time**: `if t % math.gcd(a, c) == 0:` checks if the difference `t` is a multiple of the GCD of `a` and `c`. If it is, then there is a common time, and the program calculates and returns the first common time using `b + a * x`.
4. **Return -1 if No Common Time**: If no common time is found, the program returns `-1`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description.
