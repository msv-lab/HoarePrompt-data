Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `c` are both 1, and `b` and `d` are different. For example, if the input is:

```
1 2
1 3
```

Rick will scream at times 2, 3, 4, 5, ... and Morty will scream at times 3, 4, 5, 6, .... They will first scream at the same time at time 3. However, the program will not output 3; instead, it will output -1, which is incorrect according to the problem description. This indicates that the program fails to correctly identify the first common scream time in this specific scenario.
