Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program provided meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads two pairs of integers `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` from the user, ensuring that each integer is within the range 1 to 100, as required by the problem description.

2. **Initial Check for Immediate Scream:**
   - The program checks if `b` is equal to `d`. If they are equal, it means Rick and Morty scream at the same time immediately, and the program prints `b` and terminates. This handles the case where the first scream times are the same.

3. **Finding the First Common Scream Time:**
   - The program calculates a value `t` as `d - b`.
   - It then iterates over a range of values determined by the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. This range is chosen to ensure that the loop covers a sufficient number of potential solutions.
   - For each value `x` in this range, the program checks if `(a * x - t) % c == 0`. This condition ensures that there exists an integer `y` such that `a * x - t = c * y`, which means `a * x + b = c * y + d`, i.e., `b + a * x` and `d + c * y` are the same time.
   - If such an `x` is found, the program prints `b + a * x` and terminates. This correctly identifies the first time Rick and Morty scream at the same time.

4. **Handling No Common Scream Time:**
   - If no such `x` is found within the range, the program prints `-1` and terminates. This handles the case where Rick and Morty never scream at the same time.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Correct Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the input and ensures that the values are within the specified range.
- **Immediate Scream Check:** The initial check for `b == d` correctly handles the case where the first scream times are the same.
- **Finding the First Common Scream Time:** The loop and the condition inside it correctly identify the first time Rick and Morty scream at the same time, if such a time exists.
- **No Common Scream Time:** The program correctly prints `-1` if no common scream time is found, handling the case where Rick and Morty never scream at the same time.

Thus, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
