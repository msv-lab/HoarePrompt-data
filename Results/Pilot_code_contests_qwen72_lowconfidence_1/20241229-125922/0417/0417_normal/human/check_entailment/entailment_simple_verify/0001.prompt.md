You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Examples

Input

20 2
9 19


Output

82


Input

2 1
16 12


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if b == d:
        print(b)
        sys.exit()
    t = d - b
    for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
        if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
            print(b + a * x)
            sys.exit()
    print(-1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in all potential cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The loop `for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11)` might not cover all possible cases where a solution exists. The formula used to determine the range is not clearly justified and could lead to missing valid solutions.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases effectively. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   4 1
   6 3
   ```
   Here, Rick's screams are at times 1, 5, 9, 13, ... and Morty's screams are at times 3, 9, 15, 21, .... They both scream at time 9, but the program does not correctly identify this.

To ensure the program is correct, it should be rewritten to handle these issues. Specifically, it should use `input()` for Python 3 compatibility, and the logic for finding the first common scream time should be more robust. A better approach would involve using the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals and checking for the first common time.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 100.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    c, d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if (b == d) :
        print(b)
        sys.exit()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are the integers provided by the user's input. If `b` is equal to `d`, the program has terminated.
    t = d - b
    for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
        if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
            print(b + a * x)
            sys.exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, and `t` is `d - b`. If the loop finds an `x` such that `(a * x - t) % c == 0`, the program prints `b + a * x` and exits. If no such `x` is found, the loop completes without printing, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.
    print(-1)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
