You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Examples

Input

20 2
9 19


Output

82


Input

2 1
16 12


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if b == d:
        print(b)
        sys.exit()
    t = d - b
    for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
        if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
            print(b + a * x)
            sys.exit()
    print(-1)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
