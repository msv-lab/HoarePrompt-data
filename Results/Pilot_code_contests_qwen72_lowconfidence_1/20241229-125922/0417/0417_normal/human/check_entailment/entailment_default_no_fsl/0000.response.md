Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for every potential case:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: In Python 3, `raw_input()` has been replaced by `input()`. This would cause the program to fail in Python 3 environments. While the problem statement doesn't specify the Python version, it's a common assumption to test the code in a modern environment (Python 3).

2. **Range Calculation**: The range for the loop is calculated as `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. This formula is not derived from any clear mathematical reasoning and might not cover all possible cases where a solution exists. It's unclear why `+ 11` is added, and this could lead to missing valid solutions.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle the edge case where `a` and `c` are both 1 and `b` and `d` are different. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`, and `d = 3`, the program should output `-1` because they will never scream at the same time. However, the current logic might incorrectly find a solution due to the arbitrary range calculation.

4. **Initial Check for Equality**: The initial check `if b == d:` is correct, but it is not sufficient to ensure correctness for all cases. The program needs a more robust method to determine if there is a common time when both Rick and Morty scream.

To fix these issues, a more reliable approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `a` and `c` and checking if the initial offsets `b` and `d` align within this LCM. This ensures that all potential cases are covered.
