You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A monster is chasing after Rick and Morty on another planet. They're so frightened that sometimes they scream. More accurately, Rick screams at times b, b + a, b + 2a, b + 3a, ... and Morty screams at times d, d + c, d + 2c, d + 3c, .... 

<image>

The Monster will catch them if at any point they scream at the same time, so it wants to know when it will catch them (the first time they scream at the same time) or that they will never scream at the same time.

Input

The first line of input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). 

The second line contains two integers c and d (1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100).

Output

Print the first time Rick and Morty will scream at the same time, or  - 1 if they will never scream at the same time.

Examples

Input

20 2
9 19


Output

82


Input

2 1
16 12


Output

-1

Note

In the first sample testcase, Rick's 5th scream and Morty's 8th time are at time 82. 

In the second sample testcase, all Rick's screams will be at odd times and Morty's will be at even times, so they will never scream at the same time.
Program:
```
import sys

def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    (c, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if b == d:
        print(b)
        sys.exit()
    t = d - b
    for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
        if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
            print(b + a * x)
            sys.exit()
    print(-1)


```
Output hints: The function reads two pairs of integers from the user, `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100. The function then checks if `b` is equal to `d`. If they are equal, the function prints `b` and terminates. If `b` is not equal to `d`, the function calculates a value `t` as `d - b` and iterates over a range of values determined by the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. For each value `x` in this range, the function checks if `(a * x - t) % c == 0`. If such an `x` is found, the function prints `b + a * x` and terminates. If no such `x` is found, the function prints `-1` and terminates. The function does not return any value; it only prints to the console and exits.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
