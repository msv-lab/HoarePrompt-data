Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine if Rick and Morty will scream at the same time has a flaw. The range for the iteration is calculated using the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`, which is not derived from a clear mathematical basis and may not cover all possible scenarios where a common screaming time exists. Additionally, the check `(a * x - t) % c == 0` is not guaranteed to find the first common time if the range is not large enough or if the initial conditions are not properly handled.

For example, consider the following input:
```
a = 4, b = 1
c = 6, d = 3
```
Rick's screaming times are: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...
Morty's screaming times are: 3, 9, 15, 21, ...

The first common screaming time is 9, but the current code may not find this because the range of `x` values might not be sufficient to cover this scenario. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
