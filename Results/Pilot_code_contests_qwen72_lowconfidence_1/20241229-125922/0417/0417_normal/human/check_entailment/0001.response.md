Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in all potential cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This will cause the program to fail if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Potential Infinite Loop**: The loop `for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11)` might not cover all possible cases where a solution exists. The formula used to determine the range is not clearly justified and could lead to missing valid solutions.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases effectively. For example, consider the input:
   ```
   4 1
   6 3
   ```
   Here, Rick's screams are at times 1, 5, 9, 13, ... and Morty's screams are at times 3, 9, 15, 21, .... They both scream at time 9, but the program does not correctly identify this.

To ensure the program is correct, it should be rewritten to handle these issues. Specifically, it should use `input()` for Python 3 compatibility, and the logic for finding the first common scream time should be more robust. A better approach would involve using the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals and checking for the first common time.
