Functionality: ** The function reads two pairs of integers from the user, `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, where each integer is within the range of 1 to 100. The function then checks if `b` is equal to `d`. If they are equal, the function prints `b` and terminates. If `b` is not equal to `d`, the function calculates a value `t` as `d - b` and iterates over a range of values determined by the expression `(a * c + d + b) / a + 11`. For each value `x` in this range, the function checks if `(a * x - t) % c == 0`. If such an `x` is found, the function prints `b + a * x` and terminates. If no such `x` is found, the function prints `-1` and terminates. The function does not return any value; it only prints to the console and exits. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the user inputs values outside the specified range (1 to 100), the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead.
- The division operation in the range calculation uses integer division (`/`), which could lead to unexpected results if the division is not exact. In Python 3, `//` should be used for integer division.
- The function does not handle cases where `a` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error in the range calculation.
- The function assumes that `c` is non-zero when performing the modulus operation, which could lead to a division by zero error if `c` is zero.
