The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided. The input is expected to be two integers separated by a space, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `c` and `d` remain unchanged. Since the specific values of `a` and `b` depend on the input, they are described as being updated from user input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100.**
