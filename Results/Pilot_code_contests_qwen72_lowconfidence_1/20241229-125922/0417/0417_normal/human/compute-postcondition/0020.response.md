To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and the effects of each iteration on the variables.

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are updated from user input.
- `c` and `d` are integers provided by the user's input.
- `t` is calculated as `d - b`.
- If `b` is equal to `d`, then `t` is 0, and the program has terminated.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in range((a * c + d + b) / a + 11):
    if (a * x - t) % c == 0:
        print(b + a * x)
        sys.exit()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `x` in the range `((a * c + d + b) / a + 11)`.
   - This means the loop will run a certain number of times based on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

2. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates early if `(a * x - t) % c == 0` is true for any `x` within the range.
   - When this condition is met, the program prints `b + a * x` and exits using `sys.exit()`.

3. **Variable Values After Iterations**:
   - If the loop finds an `x` such that `(a * x - t) % c == 0`, the program prints `b + a * x` and exits.
   - If no such `x` is found, the loop will complete all its iterations.

4. **Final State**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a suitable `x`, the program will not have printed anything, and the loop will have iterated through all possible values of `x` up to the specified range.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
   - The variable `t` remains `d - b`.

### Output State:
- If the loop finds an `x` such that `(a * x - t) % c == 0`, the program will have printed `b + a * x` and exited.
- If the loop completes without finding such an `x`, the program will not have printed anything, and the loop will have iterated through all possible values of `x` up to the specified range.

Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, and `t` is `d - b`. If the loop finds an `x` such that `(a * x - t) % c == 0`, the program prints `b + a * x` and exits. If no such `x` is found, the loop completes without printing, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.**
