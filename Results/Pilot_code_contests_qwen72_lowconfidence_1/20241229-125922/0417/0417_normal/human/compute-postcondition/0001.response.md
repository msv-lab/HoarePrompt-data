The code snippet `c, d = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts (assuming the input is in the form of two space-separated numbers), and assigns these parts to `c` and `d` as integers. This means that the new values of `c` and `d` are determined by the user's input.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are updated from user input.
- `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100.

After executing the code:
- `c` and `d` are now the integers provided by the user's input, which may or may not satisfy 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 depending on the input.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain as they were, since the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are the integers provided by the user's input.**
