The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means that no further code execution occurs after this point, and the program ends. Since the program is terminated, none of the variables are updated or changed in the context of the program's execution.

Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, and `b + a` has been printed. The program has terminated.**
