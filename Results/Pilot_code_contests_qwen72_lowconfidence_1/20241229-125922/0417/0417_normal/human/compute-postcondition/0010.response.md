The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code execution occurs after this point. Since the function call does not modify any variables, their values remain unchanged. However, the program's execution stops, which affects the overall state.

Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 0, `((a * x - t) % c == 0)`, the value of `b` is printed, and the program has terminated.**
