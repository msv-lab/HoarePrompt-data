The provided Python code snippet `print(b + a * x)` is executed in the context of the given initial state. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a non-zero integer.
   - `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative.
   - `c` is a non-negative integer.
   - `x` is 2.
   - The condition `(a * x - t) % c == 0` is met, which means `b + a` has been printed and the program has terminated.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `print(b + a * x)` is executed.
   - The expression `a * x` is evaluated first, resulting in `a * 2`.
   - The expression `b + a * 2` is then evaluated, resulting in `b + 2a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The value `b + 2a` is printed.

4. **Final State**:
   - The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain unchanged.
   - The program has printed `b + 2a` and terminated.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 2, and `b + 2a` has been printed.**
