The `sys.exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further code is executed after this point, and the program exits without changing the state of any variables.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are the integers provided by the user's input, and `b` is equal to `d`. The program has terminated.**
