The code `sys.exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. No further code is executed, and the program ends without altering the values of the variables. The output state includes all the preconditions that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 2, and `b + 2a` has been printed.**
