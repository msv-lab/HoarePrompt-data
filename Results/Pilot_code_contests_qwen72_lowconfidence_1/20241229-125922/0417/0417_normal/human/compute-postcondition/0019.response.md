Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is 2. If `(a * x - t) % c == 0`, then `b + 2a` has been printed and the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values as the precondition.***
