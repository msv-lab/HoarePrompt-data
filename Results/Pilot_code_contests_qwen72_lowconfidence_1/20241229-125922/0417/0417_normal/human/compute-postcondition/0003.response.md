The value of `b` is printed. Since `b` is equal to `d`, and both `b` and `d` are provided by the user's input, the output state remains the same except that the value of `b` (which is equal to `d`) has been printed.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are the integers provided by the user's input, and `b` is equal to `d`.**
