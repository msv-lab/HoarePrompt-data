The provided code snippet only contains a print statement `print(-1)`. This means that the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the program prints `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `t` is `d - b`, and `-1` is printed.
Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `t` is `d - b`, and `-1` is printed.**
