`t` is assigned the value `d - b`. The value of `b` is equal to the second user input, and `d` is an integer provided by the user's input. If `b` is equal to `d`, the program has terminated, which means `t` would be 0 in this case. Otherwise, `t` is the difference between `d` and `b`. The states of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are updated from user input, `c` and `d` are the integers provided by the user's input, `t` is `d - b`, if `b` is equal to `d` then `t` is 0 and the program has terminated.**
