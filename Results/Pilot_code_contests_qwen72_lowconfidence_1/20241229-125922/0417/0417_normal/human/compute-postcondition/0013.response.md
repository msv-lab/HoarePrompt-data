The code snippet `print(b + a * x)` will print the value of `b + a * x`. Given that `x` is 1, the expression simplifies to `b + a`.

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is 1, the value of `b + a` will be printed.

The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are not modified by this code snippet, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, and `b + a` has been printed.**
