The code snippet `print(b + a * x)` calculates the value of `b + a * x` and prints it. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a non-zero integer,
- `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative,
- `c` is a non-negative integer,
- `x` is 0,
- `((a * x - t) % c == 0)`,

Since `x` is 0, the expression `a * x` evaluates to 0. Therefore, the value of `b + a * x` simplifies to `b + 0`, which is simply `b`.

The print statement outputs the value of `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-zero integer, `b` and `d` are such that `d + b` is non-negative, `c` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 0, `((a * x - t) % c == 0)`, and the value of `b` is printed.**
