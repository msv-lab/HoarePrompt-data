Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it processes the sequence `a` and checks for the presence of the sequence `b`. Specifically, the initial part of the loop that sets up the `mem` counter and the `dis` set is incorrect. The program incorrectly initializes the `mem` counter and the `dis` set, which leads to incorrect results.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3 1
1 2 3 2 1
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce incorrect output because it does not correctly initialize the `mem` counter and the `dis` set. The initial setup of these structures is flawed, leading to incorrect matching of the sequence `b` within the sequence `a`.

To fix this, the initialization of `mem` and `dis` should be done correctly before starting the main loop that checks for valid positions `q`. Additionally, the program should handle the sliding window approach more carefully to ensure that the counters and sets are updated correctly as the window slides through the sequence `a`.
