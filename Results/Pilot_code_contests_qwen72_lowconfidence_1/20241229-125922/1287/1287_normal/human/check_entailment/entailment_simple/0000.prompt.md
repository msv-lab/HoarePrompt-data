You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1)·p ≤ n; q ≥ 1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence aq, aq + p, aq + 2p, ..., aq + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements.

Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and p (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109).

Output

In the first line print the number of valid qs. In the second line, print the valid values in the increasing order.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin
from collections import Counter
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and p are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, p ≤ 2·10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m, q = rints()
    a, b, ans = rints(), Counter(rints()), []
    all = len(b)
    for i in range(q):
        dis, mem = set(), Counter()
        
        if int(ceil((n - i) / q)) < m:
            break
        
        for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
            mem[a[j]] += 1
        
        for k, j in mem.items():
            if j == b[k]:
                dis.add(k)
        
        be = i
        
        for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
            mem[a[j]] += 1
            if mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]:
                dis.add(a[j])
            else:
                dis.discard(a[j])
            if len(dis) == all:
                ans.append(be + 1)
            mem[a[be]] -= 1
            if b[a[be]] and mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]:
                dis.add(a[be])
            else:
                dis.discard(a[be])
            be += q
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `ans` is a list containing the indices `be + 1` where the window of size `m` with step `q` has all elements matching the required frequencies in `b`, `i` is the last value of `i` for which the loop executed, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for the last window of size `m` with step `q`, `be` is the index just after the last element processed in the last window of size `m` with step `q`. If the loop does not execute, `ans` is an empty list, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, and `be` is 0.
    print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, sorted(ans)))))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
