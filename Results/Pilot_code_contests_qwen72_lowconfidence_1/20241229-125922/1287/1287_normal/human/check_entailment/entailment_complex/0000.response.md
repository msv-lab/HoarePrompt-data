Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to a few issues:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The variable `q` is used both for the step size `p` in the problem description and for the input `q` in the function. This is confusing and potentially incorrect. According to the problem description, the step size should be `p`, not `q`.

2. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input using `q` instead of `p` for the step size. This means that the function is not correctly interpreting the input according to the problem description.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if int(ceil((n - i) / q)) < m:` should use `p` instead of `q` to ensure that the step size is correctly considered.

4. **Subsequence Processing**: The logic for processing subsequences and checking their validity is complex and might not handle edge cases correctly. Specifically, the way the `mem` and `dis` sets are updated and checked might not accurately reflect the required conditions for a valid subsequence.

5. **Output Format**: The output format seems correct, but the logic leading to the output needs to be verified to ensure it matches the problem description.

### Corrected Version:
To correct the program, we need to ensure that the step size `p` is used correctly and that the logic for finding valid starting indices is accurate. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from __future__ import division
from sys import stdin
from collections import Counter
from math import ceil

def func():
    rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    n, m, p = rints()
    a, b, ans = rints(), Counter(rints()), []
    
    # Initialize the sliding window
    for i in range(p):
        mem = Counter()
        dis = set()
        
        # Check if there are enough elements to form a subsequence
        if int(ceil((n - i) / p)) < m:
            continue
        
        # Initialize the first window
        for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * p + p, p):
            mem[a[j]] += 1
        
        # Check if the first window is valid
        for k, j in mem.items():
            if j == b[k]:
                dis.add(k)
        
        # Slide the window through the array
        be = i
        while be + (m - 1) * p < n:
            if len(dis) == len(b):
                ans.append(be + 1)
            
            # Update the window
            if be + m * p < n:
                new_elem = a[be + m * p]
                old_elem = a[be]
                
                mem[new_elem] += 1
                if mem[new_elem] == b[new_elem]:
                    dis.add(new_elem)
                else:
                    dis.discard(new_elem)
                
                mem[old_elem] -= 1
                if mem[old_elem] == b[old_elem]:
                    dis.add(old_elem)
                else:
                    dis.discard(old_elem)
            
            be += p
    
    print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, sorted(ans)))))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:
1. **Variable Naming**: The step size is correctly named `p` throughout the function.
2. **Input Reading**: The input is read correctly according to the problem description.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition ensures that there are enough elements to form a subsequence of length `m` with step size `p`.
4. **Sliding Window**: The sliding window logic is correctly implemented to check each subsequence and update the `mem` and `dis` sets.
5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

By making these corrections, the program now meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
