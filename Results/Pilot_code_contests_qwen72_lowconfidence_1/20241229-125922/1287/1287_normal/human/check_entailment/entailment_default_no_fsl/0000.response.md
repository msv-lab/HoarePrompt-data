Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has a variable naming issue that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the variable `q` is used both for the step size and for reading input, which can lead to confusion and incorrect behavior. Additionally, the logic for updating the `mem` counter and the `dis` set may not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the step size `q` is large relative to the length of the array `a`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Variable Naming Conflict**: The variable `q` is used for the step size and also for reading input values. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the input value for `q` is different from the step size.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Updating `mem` and `dis`**:
   - The code initializes the `mem` counter and the `dis` set for the initial segment of the array, but the logic for updating these structures as the window slides through the array may not be correct.
   - Specifically, the condition `if len(dis) == all` is used to check if the current window matches the frequency of elements in `b`, but this condition might not be accurate due to the way `mem` and `dis` are updated.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code might not handle edge cases where the step size `q` is very large compared to the length of the array `a`. For example, if `q` is greater than `n`, the code should terminate early, but it might not do so correctly.
   - The code might also fail when the array `a` is very short compared to the length of `b` and the step size `q`.

To ensure the code is correct, it would need to be revised to address these issues, particularly the variable naming conflict and the logic for updating the `mem` counter and `dis` set.
