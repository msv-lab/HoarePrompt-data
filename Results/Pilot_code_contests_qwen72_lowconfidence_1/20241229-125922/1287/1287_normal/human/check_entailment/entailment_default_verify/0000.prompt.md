You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1)·p ≤ n; q ≥ 1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence aq, aq + p, aq + 2p, ..., aq + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements.

Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and p (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109).

Output

In the first line print the number of valid qs. In the second line, print the valid values in the increasing order.

    (n, m, q) = rints()

    all = len(b)
    for i in range(q):

            if j == b[k]:
                dis.add(k)
        be = i
        for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
            mem[a[j]] += 1
            if mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]:
                dis.add(a[j])
            else:
                dis.discard(a[j])
            if len(dis) == all:
                ans.append(be + 1)
            mem[a[be]] -= 1
            if b[a[be]] and mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]:
                dis.add(a[be])
            else:
                dis.discard(a[be])
            be += q
    print('%d\n%s' % (len(ans), ' '.join(map(str, sorted(ans)))))

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has an issue in the way it handles the sliding window mechanism to check for valid starting positions `q`. Specifically, the initialization of the sliding window is incomplete, which can lead to incorrect results. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Window Construction**: The initial window is constructed using a loop that iterates from `i` to `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step of `q`. However, this loop only initializes the `mem` counter for the first `m` elements. It does not check if these elements match the required counts in `b`.

2. **Sliding Window Update**: The sliding window update logic is flawed. When moving the window, the program updates the `mem` counter but does not correctly handle the removal of the element that is being slid out of the window. This can lead to incorrect counts and, consequently, incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the length of the sequence `a` is not sufficient to form a valid window of size `m` with the given step `q`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
Input:
5 3 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
1
```

Actual Output:
```
0
```

The program fails to identify the valid starting position `1` because the initial window construction and sliding window update logic are incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `q`, followed by two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then processes these inputs to find all starting indices in `a` (with a step size of `q`) where a subsequence of length `m` contains exactly the same frequency of elements as specified in `b`. The function prints the number of such valid subsequences and their starting indices in ascending order. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where no valid subsequences are found, in which case it prints `0` and an empty list. The function also handles cases where the step size `q` is larger than the remaining elements in the list `a`, terminating early to avoid unnecessary processing.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
