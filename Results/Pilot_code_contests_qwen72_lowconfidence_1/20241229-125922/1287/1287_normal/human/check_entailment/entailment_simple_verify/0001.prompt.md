You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Sereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b1, b2, ..., bm. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1)·p ≤ n; q ≥ 1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence aq, aq + p, aq + 2p, ..., aq + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements.

Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.

Input

The first line contains three integers n, m and p (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·105). The next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109). The next line contains m integers b1, b2, ..., bm (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109).

Output

In the first line print the number of valid qs. In the second line, print the valid values in the increasing order.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it processes the sequence `a` and checks for the presence of the sequence `b`. Specifically, the initial part of the loop that sets up the `mem` counter and the `dis` set is incorrect. The program incorrectly initializes the `mem` counter and the `dis` set, which leads to incorrect results.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3 1
1 2 3 2 1
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will produce incorrect output because it does not correctly initialize the `mem` counter and the `dis` set. The initial setup of these structures is flawed, leading to incorrect matching of the sequence `b` within the sequence `a`.

To fix this, the initialization of `mem` and `dis` should be done correctly before starting the main loop that checks for valid positions `q`. Additionally, the program should handle the sliding window approach more carefully to ensure that the counters and sets are updated correctly as the window slides through the sequence `a`.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
