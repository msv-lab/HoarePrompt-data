The code snippet `be += q` increments the value of `be` by `q`. Here's the detailed impact:

- The value of `be` is incremented by `q`. Given the initial state, `be` was some value, and now it is `be + q`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `i` remains 2.
- `m` remains at least 2.
- `q` remains a positive integer.
- `a` remains a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2.
- `j` remains `2 + m * q + q`.
- `mem` remains a `Counter` object with the specified counts.
- `dis` remains the set of keys from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`.
- `ans` remains a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.
- `n` remains greater than `2 + m * q + q`.
- `mem[a[be]]` remains `mem[a[be]] - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + m * q + q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]` (potentially updated). If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, then `a[be]` is added to `dis`. Otherwise, `a[be]` is not added to `dis` if it was present. `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all` (potentially updated), `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is now `mem[a[be]] - 1`, `be` is `be + q`.**
