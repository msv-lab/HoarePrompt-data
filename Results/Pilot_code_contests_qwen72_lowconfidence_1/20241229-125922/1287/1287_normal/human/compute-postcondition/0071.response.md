The code reassigns the variables `dis` and `mem` to new instances of a set and a `Counter` object, respectively. This resets their values, discarding any previous contents.

- `dis` was previously a set containing unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`. Now, `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` was previously a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for the last window of size `m` with step `q`. Now, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `q`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `all`, `i`, `be`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` contains the indices `be + 1` where the window of size `m` with step `q` has all elements matching the required frequencies in `b`, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `be` is the index just after the last element processed in the last window of size `m` with step `q`, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is greater than or equal to `m`. If the loop does not execute, `ans` is an empty list, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, and `be` is 0.**
