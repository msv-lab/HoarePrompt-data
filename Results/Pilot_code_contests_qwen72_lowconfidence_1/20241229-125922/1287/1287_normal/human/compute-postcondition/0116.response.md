Postcondition: ***All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, then `a[j]` is added to the set `dis`. Otherwise, if `a[j]` was present in the set `dis`, it is removed. If the length of `dis` is equal to `all`, `ans` now includes the value `be + 1`.***
