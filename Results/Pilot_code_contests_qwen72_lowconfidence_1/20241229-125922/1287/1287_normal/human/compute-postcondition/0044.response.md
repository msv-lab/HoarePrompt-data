The value of `be` is incremented by `q`.

- Initial value of `be` is 0.
- After incrementing by `q`, `be` becomes `0 + q` which simplifies to `q`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`. If `b[a[be]]` is non-zero and `mem[a[be]]` is equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `a[0]`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[0]` if `mem[a[0]]` was equal to `b[a[0]]` before the decrement, or `dis` remains unchanged if `b[a[be]]` is False or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`.**
