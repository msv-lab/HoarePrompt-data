Functionality: ** The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `q`, followed by two lists `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then processes these inputs to find all starting indices in `a` (with a step size of `q`) where a subsequence of length `m` contains exactly the same frequency of elements as specified in `b`. The function prints the number of such valid subsequences and their starting indices in ascending order. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include scenarios where no valid subsequences are found, in which case it prints `0` and an empty list. The function also handles cases where the step size `q` is larger than the remaining elements in the list `a`, terminating early to avoid unnecessary processing. **
