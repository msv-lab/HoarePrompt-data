To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\).
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `mem` has at least one item. Since `mem` is a `Counter` object, it must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial State of `mem`**: According to the given conditions, `mem` is initialized with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\). This means `mem` will have `m` key-value pairs, where each key is an element from the list `a` at positions `1 + k * q` for \(0 \leq k < m\).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Ensure `mem` is Not Empty**: The loop will execute if `mem` has at least one item. Given the initialization of `mem`, it will have `m` items, and since `m` is at least 2, `mem` will not be empty.
- **Initial Values of `k` and `j`**: The loop iterates over the items in `mem`, so `k` will be the keys and `j` will be the values. The initial state of `k` and `j` should reflect the first item in `mem`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will execute as long as `mem` is initialized with at least one item, which it is according to the given conditions. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\), `be` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list.**
