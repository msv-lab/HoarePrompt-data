To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 0.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the count of `a[j]` incremented by 1.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step of `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, the upper bound of the range must be valid.
2. **Range Calculation**: The range is defined as `range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i + (m - 1) * q`.
3. **Initial Values**: At the start of the first iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, the initial range is `range(0, (m - 1) * q, q)`.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be updated. Typically, `i` would be incremented by some value, but since the problem does not specify how `i` changes, we assume it remains the same for simplicity.
5. **Range Validity**: The loop will execute one more time if the next value of `j` (which is `i + q`) is less than `i + (m - 1) * q`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` will be incremented by `q` in the next iteration.
- The condition `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the count of `a[j]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `j` is `q`**.
