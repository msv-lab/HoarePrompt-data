The code `dis.add(k)` adds the value of `k` to the set `dis`. Since the initial state mentions that if `j == b[k]`, then `k` is added to the set `dis`, this indicates that `k` was already determined to satisfy this condition before the code snippet was executed.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `k` is now included in the set `dis`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` must have at least one more item, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `k` is added to the set `dis`**
