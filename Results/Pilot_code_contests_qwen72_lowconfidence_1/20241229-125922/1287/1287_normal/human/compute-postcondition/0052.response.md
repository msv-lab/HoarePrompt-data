The given Python code snippet `mem[a[be]] -= 1` impacts the `mem` dictionary by decrementing the value associated with the key `a[be]` by 1. Here, `be` is `q`, so the key being accessed and modified is `a[q]`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `mem[a[be]]` is decremented by 1. Since `be` is `q`, this means `mem[a[q]] -= 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Thus, the updated state is:

- `n` is greater than `m * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`
- `be` is `q`
- `j` is `m * q`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`
- `dis` may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`, `dis` may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`.**
