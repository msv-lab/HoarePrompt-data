To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is greater than `m * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`
- `be` is `2 * q`
- `j` is `m * q`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `a[q]` and may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described
- If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present
- If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before)

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `j`**:
   - The initial value of `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q`.
   - Given `i` is 0, the initial value of `j` is `(m - 1) * q`.

2. **Increment of `j`**:
   - The loop increments `j` by `q` each iteration.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Initial Value of `j`**:
  - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`.
  - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `((m - 1) * q) + q = m * q`.

- **State of `mem` and `dis`**:
  - The state of `mem` and `dis` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.
  - Specifically, `mem[a[j]]` will be incremented by 1, and `mem[a[j - q]]` will be decremented by 1.
  - The set `dis` will be updated based on these changes in `mem`.

- **Condition for `ans`**:
  - The condition for updating `ans` will be re-evaluated based on the new state of `mem` and `dis`.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` is greater than `m * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`
- `be` is `2 * q`
- `j` is `m * q + q`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `mem[a[j - q]]` is `mem[a[j - q]] - 1`
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `a[q]` and may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described
- If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present
- If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before)
