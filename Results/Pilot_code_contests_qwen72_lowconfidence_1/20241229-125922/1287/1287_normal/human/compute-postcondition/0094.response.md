The code snippet updates the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by incrementing it by 1.

- The initial state specifies that `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- The value of `a[j]` is accessed and its count in `mem` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated value of `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`.

All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `be` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, and `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.**
