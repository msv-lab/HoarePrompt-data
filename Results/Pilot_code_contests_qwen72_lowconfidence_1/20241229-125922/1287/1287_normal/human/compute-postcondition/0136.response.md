The code snippet resets `dis` to an empty set and `mem` to an empty `Counter` object. This means that any previous values stored in `dis` and `mem` are cleared.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.
