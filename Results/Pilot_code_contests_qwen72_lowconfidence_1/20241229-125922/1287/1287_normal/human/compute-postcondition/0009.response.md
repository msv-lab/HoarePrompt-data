To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop is defined as follows:

```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dis` is an empty set.
   - `mem` is an empty `Counter` object.
   - If `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is less than `m`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop `for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q)` will execute if the range `range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, the stop value (`i + (m - 1) * q`) must be greater than the start value (`i`).

3. **Range Validity:**
   - The condition for the range to be valid is:
     \[
     i + (m - 1) * q > i
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     (m - 1) * q > 0
     \]
   - Since `m` and `q` are positive integers, `(m - 1) * q` will always be greater than 0 as long as `m` is at least 2. If `m` is 1, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty.

4. **Additional Conditions:**
   - The condition `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) < m` should not be true for the loop to execute. This condition checks if the remaining elements to process are fewer than required by the loop. If this condition is true, the loop will not execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is not less than `m`.

### Final State:
State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`**.
