`dis.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `dis`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged unless they are impacted by this operation.

- `j` remains `i + (m - 1) * q + q`.
- `be` remains `be + q`.
- `mem[a[be]]` remains `mem[a[be]] - 1`.
- The condition checking if `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and if `a[be]` was in the set `dis` remains valid.
- The condition checking if the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all` and the effect on `ans` remains valid.
- The condition checking if `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]` and the addition or removal of `a[be]` from `dis` remains valid.
- `mem[a[j]]` remains `mem[a[j]] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`, if `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`, if the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`, if `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `a[j]` is added to the set `dis`.**
