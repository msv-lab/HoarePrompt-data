The code snippet `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1.

- The value of `j` is given as `1 + 2 * q`.
- The list `a` is defined such that its elements are spaced by `q` starting from `i`. Since `i` is 1, the element `a[j]` is `a[1 + 2 * q]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1 and `mem[a[1 + q]]` = 1.

After executing the code snippet:
- `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1, so `mem[a[1 + 2 * q]]` is now 1 (assuming it was initially 0, as it was not explicitly mentioned).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `mem[a[1 + 2 * q]]` is 1.
- All other initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 + 2 * q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1, `mem[a[1 + q]]` = 1, and `mem[a[1 + 2 * q]]` = 1, `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**
