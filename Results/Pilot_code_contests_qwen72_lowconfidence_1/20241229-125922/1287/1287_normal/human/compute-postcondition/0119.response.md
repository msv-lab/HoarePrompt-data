The code `dis.discard(a[be])` attempts to remove the element `a[be]` from the set `dis`. If `a[be]` is not in `dis`, this operation has no effect. Given the initial state:

- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`.
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.

After executing `dis.discard(a[be])`:

- If `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is now removed.
- If `a[be]` was not in `dis`, the set `dis` remains unchanged.
- The length of `dis` may have decreased by 1 if `a[be]` was in `dis`.
- The condition about `ans` and `be + 1` is not directly affected by this line of code, but the length of `dis` might change, which could affect future conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**All other variables remain unchanged, the updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `a[be]` was in `dis`, `a[be]` is removed from `dis`. If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.**
