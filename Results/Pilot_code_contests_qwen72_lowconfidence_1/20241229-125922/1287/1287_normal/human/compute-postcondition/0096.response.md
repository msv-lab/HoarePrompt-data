The code snippet `dis.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `dis`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `be` is 1
- `ans` is an empty list
- `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`
- The current value of `mem[a[j]]` is equal to the frequency of `a[j]` in `b`

After executing the code snippet:
- `dis` now includes `a[j]` in addition to its previous contents.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `be` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`, and `a[j]` is added to `dis`. The current value of `mem[a[j]]` is equal to the frequency of `a[j]` in `b`.**
