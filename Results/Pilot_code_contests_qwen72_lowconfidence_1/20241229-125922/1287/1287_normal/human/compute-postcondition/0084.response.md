Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\), `be` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list. If `j` is equal to `b[k]`, then `dis` is a set containing `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.***
