The given Python code snippet updates the `Counter` object `mem` by incrementing the count of the element at index `j` in the list `a`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` is at least 2
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
   - `j` is 2 + 2*q
   - `dis` is an empty set
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1 and `mem[2 + 2*q + q^2]` incremented by 1
   - `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
   - `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `j` in the list `a` in the `Counter` object `mem`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `j` is 2 + 2*q, so the element at index `j` in the list `a` is `a[2 + 2*q]`.
   - Since `a` is a list of integers starting from 2 and spaced by `q`, the element at index `2 + 2*q` is `2 + (2 + 2*q) * q = 2 + 2*q + 2*q^2`.
   - The count of `2 + 2*q + 2*q^2` in `mem` is incremented by 1.

4. **Updated State**:
   - `mem[2 + 2*q]` remains incremented by 1.
   - `mem[2 + 2*q + q^2]` remains incremented by 1.
   - `mem[2 + 2*q + 2*q^2]` is now incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is 2 + 2*q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1, `mem[2 + 2*q + q^2]` incremented by 1, and `mem[2 + 2*q + 2*q^2]` incremented by 1, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`**.
