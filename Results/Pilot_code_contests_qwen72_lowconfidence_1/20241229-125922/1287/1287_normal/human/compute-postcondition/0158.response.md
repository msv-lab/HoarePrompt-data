To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`
- `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1
- `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`
- `be` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`
- If `mem` is empty, `dis` remains an empty set and `ans` remains an empty list

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `j`:**
   - The initial value of `j` in the loop is `i + (m - 1) * q`.
   - Given `i` is 2 and `m` is at least 2, the initial value of `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`.

2. **Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`.
   - The step size of the loop is `q`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the initial value of `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `2 + (m - 1) * q < n`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to meet the condition `2 + (m - 1) * q < n`.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`, `be` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `n` must be greater than `2 + (m - 1) * q`**
