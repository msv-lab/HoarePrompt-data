Postcondition: ***`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`. If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`. If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`. `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, `a[j]` is added to the set `dis`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was in `dis`.***
