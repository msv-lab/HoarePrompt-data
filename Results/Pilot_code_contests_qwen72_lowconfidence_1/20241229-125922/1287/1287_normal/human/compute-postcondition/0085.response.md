To determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop's control variable and the conditions under which the loop continues.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\)
- `be` is 0
- `ans` is an empty list
- If `j` is equal to `b[k]`, then `dis` is a set containing `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set

The loop in question is:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Control Variable**: The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` dictionary, where each item is a key-value pair `(k, j)`.
2. **State Adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, the `mem` dictionary must still contain items to iterate over. The state variables that directly affect the loop are:
   - `mem`: The `Counter` object that contains the key-value pairs being iterated over.
   - `k` and `j`: These are the current key and value from `mem` during the iteration.

Since the loop is iterating over the items in `mem`, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `mem`. Specifically, `mem` must still contain at least one more key-value pair.

### Adjusted State:
- `mem` must still contain at least one more key-value pair for the loop to execute one more time.
- The values of other state variables (`n`, `m`, `q`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `all`, `i`, `j`, `be`, `ans`, and `dis`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with at least one more key-value pair, `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and if `j` is equal to `b[k]`, then `dis` is a set containing `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.**
