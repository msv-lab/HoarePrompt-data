The value of `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is `m * q`, this means the element at index `m * q` in the list `a` is accessed, and its corresponding value in the `mem` dictionary is incremented.

Since `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, and `i` is 0, the value at `a[j]` would be the element at position `m * q` in the list `a`.

The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `dis` may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described.**
