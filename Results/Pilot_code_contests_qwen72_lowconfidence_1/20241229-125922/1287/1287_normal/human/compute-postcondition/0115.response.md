The code snippet `ans.append(be + 1)` adds the value of `be + 1` to the list `ans`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

- `ans` now includes one more element, which is `be + 1`.
- All other variables (`mem`, `a`, `b`, `dis`, `j`) remain in their previous state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, then `a[j]` is added to the set `dis`. Otherwise, if `a[j]` was present in the set `dis`, it is removed. `ans` now includes the value `be + 1`.**
