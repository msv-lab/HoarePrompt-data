To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 0.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the count of `a[q]` incremented by 1.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
- `j` is `q`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i` to `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step size of `q`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `q`.
   - The loop will iterate `m` times, with `j` taking values `q`, `2q`, `3q`, ..., `(m-1)q`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`j`**: After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`. Therefore, `j` will be `2q`.
- **`i`**: `i` remains 0 throughout the loop, as it is not modified inside the loop.
- **Other Variables**: The other variables (`n`, `m`, `q`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `all`, `dis`, `mem`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain the same.

### Final State:
- `j` is `2q`.
- All other variables remain the same as their initial values.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the count of `a[q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `j` is `2q`.**
