The code initializes two new variables, `dis` and `mem`. `dis` is initialized as an empty set, and `mem` is initialized as an empty `Counter` object.

- `dis` is now an empty set.
- `mem` is now an empty `Counter` object.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers read from the input, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers read from input, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object**
