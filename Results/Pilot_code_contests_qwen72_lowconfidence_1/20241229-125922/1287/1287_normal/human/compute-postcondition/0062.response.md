The code `ans.append(be + 1)` appends the value of `be + 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `be` is `2 * q`, the value being appended is `2 * q + 1`.

- `ans` was initially either an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition.
- After appending `2 * q + 1`, `ans` will now be `[q + 1, 2 * q + 1]` if it was initially `[q + 1]`, or simply `[2 * q + 1]` if it was initially an empty list.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is `[q + 1, 2 * q + 1]` or `[2 * q + 1]` depending on the initial condition, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`, `be` is `2 * q`, `j` is `m * q + q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 2`, `mem[a[j - q]]` is `mem[a[j - q]] - 1`. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present. If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `a[q]` and may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1, 2 * q + 1]` or `[2 * q + 1]` depending on the initial condition. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before).**
