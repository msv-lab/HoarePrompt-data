The code snippet `ans.append(be + 1)` appends the value of `be + 1` to the list `ans`. Here's the detailed step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` is at least 2
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
   - `j` is `2 + m * q + q`
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3
   - `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, `dis` also includes the value `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[j]`
   - `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`
   - `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `be + 1` is appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `ans` now includes the value `be + 1`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + m * q + q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, `dis` also includes the value `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[j]`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all` and now includes `be + 1`, `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`.**
