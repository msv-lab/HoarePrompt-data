The code snippet `dis.add(k)` adds the value of `k` to the set `dis`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The only change is that `k` is now an element of `dis`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` must have at least one more item, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `dis` contains `k` and remains unchanged if `j != b[k]` or is updated if `j == b[k]`**.
