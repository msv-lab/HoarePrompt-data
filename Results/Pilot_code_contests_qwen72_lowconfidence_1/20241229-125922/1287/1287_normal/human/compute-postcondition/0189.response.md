The code snippet `dis.add(a[j])` adds the value of `a[j]` to the set `dis`.

- `a[j]` is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`.
- Before this operation, `dis` already contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`.

After executing the code snippet:

- `dis` now includes the value `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `q`, `a`, `j`, `mem`, `ans`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + m * q + q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]` and also includes the value `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`**
