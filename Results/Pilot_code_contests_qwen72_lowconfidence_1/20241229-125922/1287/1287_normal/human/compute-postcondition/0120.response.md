Postcondition: ***All other variables remain unchanged, the updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`. If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`. If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`. Otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`.***
