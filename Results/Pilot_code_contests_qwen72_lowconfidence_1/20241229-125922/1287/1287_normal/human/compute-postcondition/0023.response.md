To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to carefully consider the conditions and the current state provided.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, with `q > 0`.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is `q`.
- `dis` is a set. If `j` (which is `i + (m-1) * q`) equals `b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
- `mem` must contain at least one item.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` dictionary, which is a `Counter` object.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are items in `mem`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `mem.items()`, the state of `mem` itself does not change within this loop.
   - The state of `k` and `j` will change for each iteration, but these are local variables within the loop.

### Adjusted State for the Next Iteration:
- The state of `mem` remains unchanged.
- The state of `k` and `j` will be different for each iteration, but they are not part of the overall program state that needs to be tracked across iterations.

### Final State:
Since the only thing that changes in each iteration of the loop is the pair `(k, j)` being processed, the overall program state remains the same except for the internal loop variables.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is `q`, `dis` is a set. If `j` (which is `i + (m-1) * q`) equals `b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set. `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, and `mem` must contain at least one item.**
