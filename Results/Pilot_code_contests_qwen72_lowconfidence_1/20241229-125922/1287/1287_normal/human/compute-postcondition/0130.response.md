The code snippet adds the value `a[be]` to the set `dis`. This operation changes the state of `dis` by adding a new element, which could affect the conditions related to the length of `dis` and the inclusion of `be + 1` in `ans`.

Let's analyze the impact:

1. **`dis`**: The set `dis` now includes the value `a[be]`.
2. **Conditions**:
   - If the length of `dis` is equal to `all`, `ans` includes the value `be + 1`.
   - If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `dis` and `all`, we cannot determine the exact length of `dis` after the addition. However, we can state that `dis` now definitely contains `a[be]`.

The other variables (`j`, `be`, `mem[a[be]]`, `mem[a[j]]`, `b[a[be]]`, `a[be]`, `a[j]`, `ans`, `all`) remain unchanged unless their values are influenced by the changes in `dis`.

Output State: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 2`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `dis` includes `a[be]`, if the length of `dis` is equal to `all`, `ans` includes the value `be + 1`, otherwise, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.**
