To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 2
  - `m` is at least 2
  - `q` is a positive integer
  - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
  - `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`
  - `mem` must have at least one more item
  - `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
  - `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`
  - If `j == b[k]`, then `k` is added to the set `dis`; otherwise, `dis` remains unchanged

### Loop Structure:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the items in the dictionary `mem`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `mem` must have at least one more item.

2. **State Adjustments:**
   - **`k` and `j`:** These are the current key-value pair being processed in the loop. After each iteration, the next key-value pair from `mem` will be used.
   - **`mem`:** The dictionary `mem` must have at least one more item for the loop to continue.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - **`i`, `m`, `q`, `a`, `j`, `be`, `ans`, `dis`:** These variables are not directly affected by the loop iteration itself but may be modified within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot make any assumptions about how these variables change.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the content of the dictionary `mem`. Specifically, `mem` must have at least one more item.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` must have at least one more item, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `dis` remains unchanged if `j != b[k]` or is updated if `j == b[k]`**.
