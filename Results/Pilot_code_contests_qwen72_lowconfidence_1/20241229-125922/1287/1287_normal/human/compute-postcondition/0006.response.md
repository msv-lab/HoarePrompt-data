Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers read from the input, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers read from input, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, and the value of `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is less than `m`.***
