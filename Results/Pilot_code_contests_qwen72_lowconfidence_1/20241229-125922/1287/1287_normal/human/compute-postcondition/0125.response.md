The code snippet `dis.discard(a[j])` removes the element `a[j]` from the set `dis` if it exists in `dis`. If `a[j]` is not in `dis`, the set remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`
- `be` is `be + q`
- `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`

The impact of the code snippet `dis.discard(a[j])` is:
- `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it exists in `dis`
- If `a[j]` is not in `dis`, the set `dis` remains unchanged

Therefore, the output state is:
- `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`
- `be` is `be + q`
- `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was in `dis`

Output State: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`, if `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`, if the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`, if `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was in `dis`**
