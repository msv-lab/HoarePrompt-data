Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `q`, `p` are positive integers with `m` ≥ 2 and `1 ≤ p ≤ 2 × 10^5`, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`. If `ceil((n - i) / q) < m`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, leaving the state of the program as described above.***
