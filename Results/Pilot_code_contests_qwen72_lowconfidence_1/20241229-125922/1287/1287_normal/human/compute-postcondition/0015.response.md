Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `j` is `i + (m-1) * q`. If `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is less than `m`, `mem` remains an empty `Counter` object.**
