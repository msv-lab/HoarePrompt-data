The code snippet updates the `Counter` object `mem` by incrementing the count of the element `a[j]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is 2
- `dis` is an empty set
- `mem` is an empty `Counter` object
- `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`

The specific impact of the code snippet is:
- `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 2, `a[j]` refers to the third element in the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers starting from 2 and spaced by `q`, the third element of `a` (at index 2) is `2 + 2*q`.

Therefore, the `Counter` object `mem` now has the count of `2 + 2*q` incremented by 1.

The updated state is:
- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is 2
- `dis` is an empty set
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1
- `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is 2, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`**
