The code `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem`. Given the initial state:

- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `mem` is an empty `Counter` object.

Since `j` is 1, the element `a[1]` will be incremented in the `Counter` object `mem`.

Let's assume `a[1]` is some integer value, say `a[1] = k` (where `k` is an integer in the list `a`).

After executing the code, the output state will be:

- `mem[k]` is 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1, `be` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list.**
