Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` must have at least one more item, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`. If `j == b[k]`, then `k` is added to the set `dis`; otherwise, `dis` remains unchanged.***
