The code `dis.add(k)` adds the value `k` to the set `dis`. Based on the initial state, `dis` was initially an empty set or contained `{k}` if `j` (which is `i + (m-1) * q`) equals `b[k]`. After executing the code, `dis` will definitely contain `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is `q`, `dis` is a set containing `{k}`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, and `mem` must contain at least one item.**
