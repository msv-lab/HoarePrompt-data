You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is incremented by 1, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`. If `mem[a[j]]` is equal to `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` also contains `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. Otherwise, `dis` does not contain `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`, `be` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` includes an additional value of `3`, `n` must be greater than `2 + (m - 1) * q`.
if condition:
```
if (b[a[be]] and mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
