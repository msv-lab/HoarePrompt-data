To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the initial state and the loop conditions:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\).
- `be` is 1.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.

### Loop Condition:
```
for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Start**: The loop starts at `i + (m - 1) * q`. Given `i` is 1, this simplifies to `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
2. **Range Stop**: The loop stops at `n`.
3. **Step Size**: The loop increments by `q`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the start value must be less than the stop value:
\[ 1 + (m - 1) * q < n \]

Given that `i` is 1 and `m` is at least 2, we can simplify this to:
\[ 1 + (2 - 1) * q < n \]
\[ 1 + q < n \]

This condition ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than `1 + q` to ensure the loop can execute.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- All other conditions remain as they are, but we need to ensure `n` satisfies the condition derived above.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\), `be` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, and `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.**
