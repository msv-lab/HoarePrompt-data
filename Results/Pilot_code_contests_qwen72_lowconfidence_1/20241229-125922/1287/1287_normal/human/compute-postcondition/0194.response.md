The code `mem[a[be]] -= 1` decrements the count of the element `a[be]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1. This operation affects the state of `mem` and potentially the state of `dis` and `ans`, depending on the current values.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` is at least 2
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
   - `j` is `2 + m * q + q`
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3
   - `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, `dis` also includes the value `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[j]`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`. If the length of `dis` equals `all`, `ans` now includes `be + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - `mem[a[be]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[be]` in `mem` by 1.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `mem[a[be]]` is now `mem[a[be]] - 1`
   - The state of `dis` might change if the decrement causes `mem[a[be]]` to no longer match `b[a[be]]`.
   - The state of `ans` might change if the length of `dis` is affected and equals `all`.

### Output State:
**`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + m * q + q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]` (potentially updated), `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all` (potentially updated), `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is now `mem[a[be]] - 1`.**
