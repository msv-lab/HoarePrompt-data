Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1, `be` is 0, and the current value of `mem[a[j]]` equals the current value of `b[a[j]]`.**
