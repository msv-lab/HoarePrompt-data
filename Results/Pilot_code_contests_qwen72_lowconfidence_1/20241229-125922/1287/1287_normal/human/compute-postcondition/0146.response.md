To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`
- `dis` is an empty set
- `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1
- `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mem`**: The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `mem` must contain at least one key-value pair.
2. **`k` and `j`**: These are the key-value pairs from `mem`. The loop will iterate over each item in `mem`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- **`mem` must be non-empty**: Since `mem` is a `Counter` object, it should have at least one element to ensure the loop executes.
- **`k` and `j`**: These are the key-value pairs from `mem`. The initial state already implies that `mem` contains the counts of the elements from the list `a` as specified.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes, the only necessary adjustment is to confirm that `mem` is non-empty. Given the initial state, `mem` is populated with the counts of the elements from `a`, so it should be non-empty.

State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1, `mem` must be non-empty, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`**
