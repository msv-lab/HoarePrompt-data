To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is an empty `Counter` object.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- If `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) < m`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as intended.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Calculation**:
   - The loop starts at `i` and increments by `q` up to but not including `i + (m - 1) * q`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the upper bound of the range must be greater than the lower bound.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The condition `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) < m` must not be true for the loop to execute.
   - This condition ensures that there are enough elements in the list `a` to form at least `m` elements spaced by `q`.

3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `n` must be large enough such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1.
- `q` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `n` must be such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `j` is 1 (the first value in the range).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `be` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list.**
