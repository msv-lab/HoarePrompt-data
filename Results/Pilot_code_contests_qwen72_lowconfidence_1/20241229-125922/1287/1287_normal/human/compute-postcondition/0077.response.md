The code snippet `mem[a[j]] += 1` updates the `Counter` object `mem` by incrementing the count of the element `a[j]` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1 + q.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

After executing `mem[a[j]] += 1`:
- The value of `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1.
- Since `j` is 1 + q, the element `a[j]` is `a[1 + q]`.

Therefore, the updated `mem` will be:
- `mem[a[1]]` remains 1.
- `mem[a[1 + q]]` is now 1 (if it was 0 before) or incremented by 1 if it was already present.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 + q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1 and `mem[a[1 + q]]` = 1, `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**
