To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` Counter object, so for the loop to execute, `mem` must contain at least one item.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dis` is an empty set.
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1.
   - `m` must be at least 2.
   - `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
   - `j` is `i + (m-1) * q`.

2. **Condition for `mem` to be Non-Empty**:
   - For `mem` to be non-empty, the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` must contain valid indices within the list `a`.
   - This means that `i + (m-1) * q` must be less than `n`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - The loop will execute if `mem` contains at least one item.
   - For `mem` to contain at least one item, the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` must intersect with the indices of `a`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that:

- `n` is large enough such that `i + (m-1) * q` is less than `n`.
- `a` must have at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, `j` is `i + (m-1) * q`, and `mem` must contain at least one item.**
