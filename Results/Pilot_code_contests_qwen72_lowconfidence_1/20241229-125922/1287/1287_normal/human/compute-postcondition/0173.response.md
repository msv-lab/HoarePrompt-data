Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is incremented by 1, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`. If `b[a[be]]` is true and `mem[a[be]]` is equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `2 + 2*q` and, if `mem[a[j]]` is equal to `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` also contains `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. Otherwise, `dis` does not contain `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`. If `b[a[be]]` is `False` or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` does not include `a[2]`. `be` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` includes an additional value of `3`, `n` must be greater than `2 + (m - 1) * q`.***
