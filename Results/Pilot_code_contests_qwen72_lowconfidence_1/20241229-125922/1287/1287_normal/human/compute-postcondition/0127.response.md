The provided code snippet `ans.append(be + 1)` appends the value `be + 1` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`
- `be` is `be + q`
- `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`.
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`. If `mem[a[j]] == b[a[j]]`, `a[j]` is added to the set `dis`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was in `dis`.

The code snippet `ans.append(be + 1)` modifies the `ans` list by appending the value `be + 1` to it. This operation does not affect the values of `j`, `be`, `mem`, `dis`, `a`, `b`, `q`, or `all`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `ans` includes the value `be + 1`, and the rest of the conditions regarding `dis` and `all` remain unchanged.**
