The code snippet `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is `2 + m * q + q`
- `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 2
- `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`
- `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`

After executing the code:

- The count of `a[j]` in `mem` is incremented by 1. Since `a[j]` was already incremented by 2, it is now incremented by 3.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + m * q + q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1 except for `a[2]` which is now incremented by 0, and the count of `a[j]` (which is `2 + (m - 1) * q^2 + 2 * q`) is now incremented by 3, `dis` contains all keys `k` from `mem` for which `b[k]` is equal to `mem[k]`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, `n` must be greater than `2 + m * q + q`**
