The code `ans.append(be + 1)` appends the value of `be + 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `be` is 0, the value appended to `ans` is 1. The state of `ans` changes from being an empty list to a list containing the single element 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is [1], `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`. `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1, and `be` is 0. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` now includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[j]` if it was previously included. Additionally, the length of `dis` is equal to `all`.**
