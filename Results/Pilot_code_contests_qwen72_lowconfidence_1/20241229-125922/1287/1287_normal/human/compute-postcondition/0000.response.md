The code snippet defines a lambda function named `rints` which reads a line from standard input (`stdin`), splits the line into parts based on whitespace, and converts each part into an integer, returning the resulting list.

This definition does not change any of the existing variables or their values. It only introduces a new function that can be used later in the program to read and process input. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of the `rints` function.

Output State: **n, m, and p are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, p ≤ 2·10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9; `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin, splits it, and converts each part into an integer, returning the resulting list.**
