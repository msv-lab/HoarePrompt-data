To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
- `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 0.
- `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
- If `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is less than `m`, `mem` remains an empty `Counter` object and `dis` remains an empty set.
- `be` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts at `i + (m - 1) * q` and iterates up to `n` with a step size of `q`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the starting index `i + (m - 1) * q` must be less than `n`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m` ensures that there are enough elements in the list `a` to form a subsequence of length `m` with a step size of `q`.
   - If this condition is not met, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` must be at least 2.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be large enough such that `i + (m - 1) * q < n`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to meet the above conditions. Specifically, `n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `be` is 0**.
