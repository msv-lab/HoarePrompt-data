The code snippet adds `a[be]` to the set `dis`. Based on the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- The value of `mem[a[be]]` is decremented by 1.
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.

However, the current code snippet only adds `a[be]` to the set `dis`. This means:
- `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`.
- The length of `dis` is increased by 1 unless `a[be]` was already in `dis`.

Since the code snippet does not affect the conditions regarding `mem[a[be]]`, `b[a[be]]`, or the length of `dis` relative to `all`, these conditions remain as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**All other variables remain unchanged, the updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`. If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`. `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`.**
