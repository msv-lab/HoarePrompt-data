To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` starts at 1.
   - The loop increments `j` by `q` each time.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `i + (m - 1) * q`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `1 + q`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is now `1 + q`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `q`, `p`, `a`, `b`, `all`, `dis`, `mem`, `be`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 + q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1, `be` is 0, and `ans` is an empty list.**
