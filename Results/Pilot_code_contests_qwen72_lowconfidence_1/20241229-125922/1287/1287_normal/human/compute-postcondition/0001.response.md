The code snippet `n, m, q = rints()` calls the function `rints()`, which reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts each part into an integer, returning a list of these integers. The first three values from this list are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `q`.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, and `p` were positive integers within the range 1 to 2·10^5, and the lists `a` and `b` were defined with their respective constraints. After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to new values read from the input, and `q` is introduced with a value also read from the input. The value of `p` remains unchanged, and the lists `a` and `b` retain their initial properties.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers read from the input, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9; `rints` is a function that reads a line from stdin, splits it, and converts each part into an integer, returning the resulting list.**
