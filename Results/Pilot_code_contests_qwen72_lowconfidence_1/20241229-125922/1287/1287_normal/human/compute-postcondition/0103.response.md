The code snippet `mem[a[be]] -= 1` decreases the count of `a[be]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1. Given the initial state, `be` is 1, so `mem[a[1]]` is decremented by 1.

Let's analyze the impact:

- `mem[a[1]]` was initially set to 1 (since `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\)).
- After executing `mem[a[1]] -= 1`, `mem[a[1]]` becomes 0.

All other variables remain unchanged. The updated state is:

- `n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`.
- `mem[a[1]]` is now 0.
- `be` is 1.
- `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `a[j]` is added to `dis`. Otherwise, `mem[a[j]]` does not equal `b[a[j]]`.
- If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `mem[a[1]]` is 0, `be` is 1, `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `a[j]` is added to `dis`. Otherwise, `mem[a[j]]` does not equal `b[a[j]]`. If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list.**
