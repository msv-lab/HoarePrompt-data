The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional structure it is currently executing. However, since there is no loop or conditional structure mentioned in the context, the `break` statement would result in a syntax error if executed in this form. Assuming this is a theoretical scenario where the `break` is part of a larger context not shown here, the effect of the `break` statement is to terminate the current loop or conditional block.

Since the `break` statement does not alter any of the variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the loop or conditional structure we were in.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
