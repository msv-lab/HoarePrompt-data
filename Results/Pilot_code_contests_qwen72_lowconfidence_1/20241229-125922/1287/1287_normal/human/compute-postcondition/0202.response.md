The function `func` should accept four parameters: `n`, `m`, `p`, and two lists `a` and `b`. Here's the detailed description:

- `n`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the list `b`.
- `p`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, which is used in some way within the function (the exact usage is not specified in the given information).
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9.
- `b`: A list of `m` integers where each element bi satisfies 1 ≤ bi ≤ 10^9.

Since the output of the function is not specified, I cannot accurately describe what the function returns. However, based on the parameters, the function likely processes the lists `a` and `b` in some manner that involves the parameters `n`, `m`, and `p`.

If you can provide the expected output or behavior of the function, I can refine the description of the functionality.

For now, here is the general functionality based on the provided parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `p`, and two lists `a` and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the lengths of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. `p` is a positive integer. `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `b` is a list of `m` integers. The function's return value is not specified.**
