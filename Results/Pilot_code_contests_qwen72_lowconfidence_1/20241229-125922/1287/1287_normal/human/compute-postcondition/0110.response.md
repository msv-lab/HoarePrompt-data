To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`.
- `mem[a[1]]` is 0.
- `be` is `1 + q`.
- `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `b[a[be]]` is true and `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, then `a[be]` is added to `dis`. If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list. If `b[a[be]]` is false or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` may or may not contain `a[be]` depending on the condition `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
for j in range(i + (m - 1) * q, n, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State of `j`:**
   - `j` starts at `1 + (m - 1) * q`.

2. **Loop Increment:**
   - The loop increments `j` by `q` each iteration.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- **`j`**: After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`.
- **`n`**: `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

### Detailed Adjustments:
- `j` is incremented by `q` in each iteration.
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `j` for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q + q` (or `1 + m * q`).
- `n` must be greater than `1 + m * q`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + m * q`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + m * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `mem[a[1]]` is 0, `be` is `1 + q`, `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `b[a[be]]` is true and `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, then `a[be]` is added to `dis`. If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list. If `b[a[be]]` is false or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` may or may not contain `a[be]` depending on the condition `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`.**
