To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `i` is 2
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is a positive integer
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2
- `j` is 2 + q
- `dis` is an empty set
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1 and `mem[2 + 2*q + q^2]` incremented by 1
- `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i` and ending at `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step size of `q`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` starts at `2 + q`
   - `m` is at least 2
   - `q` is a positive integer

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Next Iteration of `j`**:
   - In the current iteration, `j` is `2 + q`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`, so the next value of `j` will be `2 + 2*q`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `i + (m - 1) * q`.
   - Given `i` is 2 and `m` is at least 2, the upper limit for `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` needs to be updated to `2 + 2*q` for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`i`, `m`, `q`, `a`, `dis`, `mem`, `be`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but we are not considering the loop body here.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is 2 + 2*q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[2 + 2*q]` incremented by 1 and `mem[2 + 2*q + q^2]` incremented by 1, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`**
