To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1 + q.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1 and `mem[a[1 + q]]` = 1.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `i` to `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step of `q`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1 + q.
   - The loop will execute as long as `1 + q <= 1 + (m - 1) * q`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 1 + q.
   - The loop condition is `1 + q <= 1 + (m - 1) * q`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `q`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `(1 + q) + q = 1 + 2 * q`.

3. **Loop Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `1 + 2 * q <= 1 + (m - 1) * q`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` is now 1 + 2 * q.
- The loop condition `1 + 2 * q <= 1 + (m - 1) * q` must hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 + 2 * q, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1]]` = 1 and `mem[a[1 + q]]` = 1, `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list.**
