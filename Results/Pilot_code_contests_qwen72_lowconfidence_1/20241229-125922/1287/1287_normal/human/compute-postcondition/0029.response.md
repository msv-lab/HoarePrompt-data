The code `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1
- `be` is 0

After executing the code `mem[a[j]] += 1`:
- The count of `a[j]` in `mem` is incremented by 1.

The updated state is:
- `n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`
- `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1
- `be` is 0

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1, `be` is 0**
