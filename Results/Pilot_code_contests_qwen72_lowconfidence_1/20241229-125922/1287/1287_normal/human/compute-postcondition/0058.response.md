The line of code `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the value associated with `a[j]` in the dictionary `mem` by 1. Given the initial state, this means:

- `mem[a[j]]` was initially `mem[a[j]] + 1` because `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1` in the initial state.
- After the increment, `mem[a[j]]` will be `mem[a[j]] + 2`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`, `be` is `2 * q`, `j` is `m * q + q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 2`, `mem[a[j - q]]` is `mem[a[j - q]] - 1`, if `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, then `dis` includes `a[q]` and may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described, if `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present, if `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`. Otherwise, `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before)**.
