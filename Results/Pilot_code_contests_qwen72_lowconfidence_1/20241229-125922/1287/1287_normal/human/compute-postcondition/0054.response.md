The code `dis.discard(a[be])` removes the element `a[be]` from the set `dis` if it is present. The value of `be` is `q`, so the element `a[q]` is discarded from `dis`.

Here's the updated state:

- `n` is greater than `m * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`
- `be` is `q`
- `j` is `m * q`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`
- `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before)

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`, `dis` does not include `a[q]` (if it was present before)**
