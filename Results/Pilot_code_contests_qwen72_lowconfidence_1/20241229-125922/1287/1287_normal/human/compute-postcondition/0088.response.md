To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with at least one more key-value pair.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- If `j == b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (k, j) in mem.items():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` dictionary. For the loop to execute one more time, `mem` must still contain at least one key-value pair.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - The loop variable `k` and `j` are updated to the next key-value pair in `mem` for each iteration.
   - The state of `mem` must remain such that it has at least one more key-value pair for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is the value of the next key-value pair in `mem`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with at least one more key-value pair.
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- If `j == b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is the value of the next key-value pair in `mem`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with at least one more key-value pair, `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, if `j == b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`, otherwise `dis` remains an empty set.**
