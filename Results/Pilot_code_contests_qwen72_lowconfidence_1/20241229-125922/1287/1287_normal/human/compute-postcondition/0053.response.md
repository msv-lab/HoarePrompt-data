The code snippet `dis.add(a[be])` adds the element `a[be]` to the set `dis`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `a[be]` corresponds to `a[q]` because `be` is `q`.
- `dis` is updated to include `a[q]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list or `[q + 1]` depending on the condition, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `mem[a[q]]` is `mem[a[q]] - 1`, `dis` includes `a[q]` and may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described. If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, then `dis` includes `a[j]`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present. If `len(dis) == all`, then `ans` is `[q + 1]`.**
