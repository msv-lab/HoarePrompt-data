The code snippet `be += q` increments the value of `be` by `q`.

- **Initial State**:
  - `n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`
  - `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2
  - `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0
  - `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
  - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
  - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
  - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
  - `i` is 1
  - `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`
  - `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
  - `mem[a[1]]` is 0
  - `be` is 1
  - `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `b[a[be]]` is true and `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, then `a[be]` is added to `dis`. If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list. If `b[a[be]]` is false or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` may or may not contain `a[be]` depending on the condition `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`.

- **Impact of the Code**:
  - The value of `be` is incremented by `q`.

- **Output State**:
  - `n` is a positive integer such that `n > 1 + q`
  - `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2
  - `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0
  - `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
  - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
  - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
  - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
  - `i` is 1
  - `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`
  - `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\) and `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
  - `mem[a[1]]` is 0
  - `be` is `1 + q`
  - `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`. If `b[a[be]]` is true and `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, then `a[be]` is added to `dis`. If the length of the set `dis` is equal to the number of unique elements in `b` (`all`), then `ans` is `[2]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list. If `b[a[be]]` is false or `mem[a[be]]` is not equal to `b[a[be]]`, then `dis` may or may not contain `a[be]` depending on the condition `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`.
