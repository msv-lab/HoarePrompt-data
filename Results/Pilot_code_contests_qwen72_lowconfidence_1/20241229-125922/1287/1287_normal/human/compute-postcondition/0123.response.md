The code snippet `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the value of `mem[a[j]]` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **`j`**: The value of `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`.
2. **`be`**: The value of `be` is `be + q`.
3. **`mem[a[be]]`**: This value is decremented by 1, and its state is checked against `b[a[be]]` and the set `dis`.
4. **`mem[a[j]]`**: This value is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`.
- `be` is `be + q`.
- The updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`.
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`.
- Otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`.

After executing `mem[a[j]] += 1`:
- The value of `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`.
- `be` is `be + q`.
- The updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`.
- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.
- If `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`.
- Otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`.
- `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`, if `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`, if the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`, if `b[a[be]]` and `mem[a[be]] == b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to the set `dis`, otherwise, if `a[be]` was in `dis`, it is removed from `dis`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`.**
