To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the items in the `mem` dictionary, where `k` is the key (an integer from the list `a`) and `j` is the value (the count of that integer in the current window).

2. **Current State**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
   - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dis` is a set. If `j` (which is `i + (m-1) * q`) equals `b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set.
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1.
   - `m` must be at least 2.
   - `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
   - `mem` must contain at least one item.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if there are more items in the `mem` dictionary to process.
   - Since `mem` is a `Counter` object, it will iterate over its items until all items are processed.

Given that the loop is iterating over the items in `mem`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the internal state of the loop, specifically the current key-value pair `(k, j)` being processed.

However, since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop (not the inner loop over `mem.items()`), we need to consider the state of the outer loop:

- The outer loop is not explicitly shown, but it likely involves incrementing `i` or some other condition that affects the contents of `mem`.

Since the loop over `mem.items()` is the inner loop, and we are asked about the state at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop, the state should reflect the next iteration of the outer loop:

- `i` should be incremented by `q` to move to the next window.
- `mem` should be updated to reflect the new window of elements from `a`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the outer loop is:

State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is `q`, `dis` is a set. If `j` (which is `i + (m-1) * q`) equals `b[k]`, then `dis` contains `{k}`. Otherwise, `dis` remains an empty set. `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`, and `mem` must contain at least one item.**
