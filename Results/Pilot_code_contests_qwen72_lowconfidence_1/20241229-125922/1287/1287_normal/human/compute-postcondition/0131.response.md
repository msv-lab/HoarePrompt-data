The code `dis.discard(a[be])` removes the element `a[be]` from the set `dis` if it is present. If `a[be]` is not in `dis`, this operation has no effect.

Let's list the impact of the code on the program:

- `dis` is updated by removing `a[be]` if it is present.
- All other variables (`j`, `be`, `mem`, `a`, `b`, `all`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is `i + (m - 1) * q + q`, `be` is `be + q`, `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 2`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `dis` does not contain `a[be]` if it was previously present, otherwise `dis` remains unchanged, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1` if the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` includes the value `be + 1` if the length of `dis` is equal to `all`.**
