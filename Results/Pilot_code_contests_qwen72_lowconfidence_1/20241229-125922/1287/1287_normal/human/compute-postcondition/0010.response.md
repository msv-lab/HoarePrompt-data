The code snippet `mem[a[j]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[j]` in the `Counter` object `mem` by 1.

- `mem` is updated such that the count of the integer `a[j]` in `mem` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers, `q` must be greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the count of `a[j]` incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`**
