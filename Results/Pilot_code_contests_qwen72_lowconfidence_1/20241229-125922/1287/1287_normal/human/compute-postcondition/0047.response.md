The line of code `dis.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `dis`. Given the initial state, `a[j]` corresponds to the element at index `j` in the list `a`, which is calculated as `i + j * q`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is `m * q`, and `q` is greater than 0, the value added to `dis` is `a[m * q]`.

Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of `a[m * q]` to the set `dis`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `dis` includes `a[m * q]`**.
