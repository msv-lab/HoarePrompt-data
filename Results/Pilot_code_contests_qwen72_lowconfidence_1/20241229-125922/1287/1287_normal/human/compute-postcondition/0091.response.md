To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on the variables and how the conditions and operations within the loop modify these variables.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `dis` is an empty set.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\).
- `be` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for k, j in mem.items():
    if j == b[k]:
        dis.add(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the `mem` dictionary.
- For each key `k` and value `j` in `mem`, it checks if `j` (which is always 1 in this context) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.
- If `j == b[k]`, the key `k` is added to the set `dis`.

### Output State:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
- `m` remains a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` remains a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` remains a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` remains a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all` remains the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` remains `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `mem` remains a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\).
- `be` remains 0.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 1, `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]]` = 1 for \(0 \leq k < m\), `be` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.**
