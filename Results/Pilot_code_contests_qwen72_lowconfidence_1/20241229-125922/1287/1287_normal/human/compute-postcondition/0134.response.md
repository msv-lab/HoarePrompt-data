To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to analyze the changes made to each variable during each iteration and consider the final state when the loop terminates. Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization and Conditions:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `int(ceil((n - i) / q)) >= m`.
   - `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
   - `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
   - `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
   - `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
   - `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `1 + (m - 1) * q`.
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object with `mem[a[1 + k * q]] = 1` for \(0 \leq k < m\).
   - `be` is 1.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `dis` is a set containing all keys `k` from `mem` where the value `j` (which is 1) is equal to the frequency of `k` in `b`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `1 + (m - 1) * q` and increments by `q` until `j` reaches `n`.
   - For each iteration:
     - `mem[a[j]]` is incremented.
     - If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, `a[j]` is added to `dis`.
     - If `mem[a[j]]` does not equal `b[a[j]]`, `a[j]` is removed from `dis`.
     - If the length of `dis` equals `all`, `ans` is appended with `be + 1`.
     - `mem[a[be]]` is decremented.
     - If `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to `dis`.
     - If `mem[a[be]]` does not equal `b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is removed from `dis`.
     - `be` is incremented by `q`.

3. **Final State Analysis:**
   - **`n`**: Remains a positive integer.
   - **`m`**: Remains a positive integer and is at least 2.
   - **`q`**: Remains a positive integer and is greater than 0.
   - **`p`**: Remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - **`a`**: Remains a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
   - **`b`**: Remains a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
   - **`all`**: Remains the number of unique elements in `b`.
   - **`i`**: Remains 1.
   - **`j`**: After the loop, `j` will be `n` because the loop increments `j` by `q` until `j` reaches `n`.
   - **`mem`**: `mem` will contain the counts of the elements in `a` that were processed by the loop. Specifically, for each element `a[j]` in the list `a` from `1 + (m - 1) * q` to `n` with step `q`, `mem[a[j]]` will be the count of `a[j]` in the subarray from `1` to `j`.
   - **`be`**: `be` will be `1 + (number of iterations) * q`. Since the loop runs from `1 + (m - 1) * q` to `n` with step `q`, the number of iterations is `(n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q`. Therefore, `be` will be `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`.
   - **`dis`**: `dis` will contain the elements from `a` whose counts in `mem` match their frequencies in `b` at the end of the loop.
   - **`ans`**: `ans` will contain the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.

4. **Summary:**
   - The loop processes elements in `a` from `1 + (m - 1) * q` to `n` with step `q`.
   - It updates `mem` to reflect the counts of these elements.
   - It updates `dis` to reflect the elements whose counts in `mem` match their frequencies in `b`.
   - It appends `be + 1` to `ans` whenever the length of `dis` equals the number of unique elements in `b`.
