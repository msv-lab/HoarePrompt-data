Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `ans` is a list containing the indices `be + 1` where the window of size `m` with step `q` has all elements matching the required frequencies in `b`, `i` is the last value of `i` for which the loop executed, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for the last window of size `m` with step `q`, `be` is the index just after the last element processed in the last window of size `m` with step `q`. If the loop does not execute, `ans` is an empty list, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, and `be` is 0.**
