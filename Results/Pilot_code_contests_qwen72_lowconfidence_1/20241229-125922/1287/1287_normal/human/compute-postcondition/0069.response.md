To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step. We'll start with the initial state and then consider the changes after each iteration of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 0.
- `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for each `j` in the range `[i, i + (m-1) * q, q]` incremented by 1.
- `m` must be at least 2.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` must be greater than or equal to `m`.
- `be` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from `i + (m - 1) * q` to `n` with a step size of `q`. For each iteration:
- `mem[a[j]]` is incremented.
- If `mem[a[j]]` equals `b[a[j]]`, `a[j]` is added to `dis`; otherwise, it is removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` equals `all`, `ans` is appended with `be + 1`.
- `mem[a[be]]` is decremented.
- If `b[a[be]]` is non-zero and `mem[a[be]]` equals `b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` is added to `dis`; otherwise, it is removed from `dis`.
- `be` is incremented by `q`.

### Final Output State:
After the loop has finished executing, the following conditions hold:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2.
- `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0.
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `ans` contains the indices `be + 1` where the window of size `m` with step `q` has all elements matching the required frequencies in `b`.
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i` is 0.
- `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for the last window of size `m` with step `q`.
- `be` is the index just after the last element processed in the last window of size `m` with step `q`.
- `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is greater than or equal to `m`.

If the loop does not execute, the following conditions hold:
- `n` is not greater than `i + (m - 1) * q`.
- `ans` remains an empty list.
- `dis` remains an empty set.
- `mem` remains an empty `Counter` object.
- `be` remains 0.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer and is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` contains the indices `be + 1` where the window of size `m` with step `q` has all elements matching the required frequencies in `b`, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `i` is 0, `dis` is a set containing all unique elements `k` from `mem` where the count of `k` in `mem` equals the count of `k` in `b`, `mem` is a `Counter` object with the counts of `a[j]` for the last window of size `m` with step `q`, `be` is the index just after the last element processed in the last window of size `m` with step `q`, `int(ceil((n - i) / q))` is greater than or equal to `m`. If the loop does not execute, `ans` is an empty list, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is an empty `Counter` object, and `be` is 0.**
