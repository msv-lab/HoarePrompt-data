The code snippet `dis.discard(a[j])` attempts to remove the element `a[j]` from the set `dis`. If `a[j]` is not in `dis`, this operation does nothing.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than `m * q`
- `i` is 0
- `m` is at least 2
- `q` is greater than 0
- `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`
- `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers
- `ans` is an empty list
- `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`
- `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`
- `be` is `q`
- `j` is `m * q`
- `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`
- `dis` may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `dis` is updated by attempting to remove `a[j]` from it. If `a[j]` was in `dis`, it is now removed; otherwise, `dis` remains unchanged.
- All other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is greater than `m * q`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `q` is greater than 0, `p` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq p \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`, `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `all` is the number of unique elements in `b`, `mem[a[0]]` is `mem[a[0]] - 1`, `be` is `q`, `j` is `m * q`, `mem[a[j]]` is `mem[a[j]] + 1`, `dis` may or may not include `a[0]` based on the conditions described, `a[j]` is removed from `dis` if it was present.**
