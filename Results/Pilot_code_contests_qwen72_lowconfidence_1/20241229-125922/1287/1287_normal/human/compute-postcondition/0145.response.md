To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, let's analyze the code and the provided initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n`: A positive integer.
- `m`: A positive integer, with `m` ≥ 2.
- `q`: A positive integer.
- `p`: A positive integer, with `1 ≤ p ≤ 2 × 10^5`.
- `a`: A list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from `i`.
- `b`: A `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers.
- `all`: The number of unique elements in `b`.
- `i`: 2.
- `j`: `n`.
- `dis`: An empty set.
- `mem`: An empty `Counter` object.
- `be`: `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`.
- `ans`: A list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(i, i + (m - 1) * q, q):
    mem[a[j]] += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + (m - 1) * q` with a step size of `q`.
   - The number of iterations is `(m - 1) + 1 = m`.

2. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - For each iteration, `j` takes on the values `i`, `i + q`, `i + 2*q`, ..., `i + (m - 1) * q`.
   - In each iteration, `mem[a[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After `m` iterations, `j` will have taken on the values `2`, `2 + q`, `2 + 2*q`, ..., `2 + (m - 1) * q`.
   - The `Counter` object `mem` will have the counts of the elements at these indices in the list `a` incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- `i`: Remains 2.
- `m`: Remains a positive integer, with `m` ≥ 2.
- `q`: Remains a positive integer.
- `a`: Remains a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2.
- `j`: After the loop, `j` will be `2 + (m - 1) * q`.
- `dis`: Remains an empty set.
- `mem`: A `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1.
- `be`: Remains `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`.
- `ans`: Remains a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.

### Output State:
**`i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least `m` elements spaced by `q` starting from 2, `j` is `2 + (m - 1) * q`, `dis` is an empty set, `mem` is a `Counter` object where the counts of the elements `a[2]`, `a[2 + q]`, `a[2 + 2*q]`, ..., `a[2 + (m - 1) * q]` are each incremented by 1, `be` is `1 + ((n - (1 + (m - 1) * q)) // q) * q`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `be + 1` for each iteration where the length of `dis` equals `all`.**
