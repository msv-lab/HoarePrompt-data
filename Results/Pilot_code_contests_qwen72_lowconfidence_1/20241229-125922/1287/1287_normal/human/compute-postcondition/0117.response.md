The code snippet `mem[a[be]] -= 1` decrements the value of `mem[a[be]]` by 1. This impacts the value of `mem[a[be]]` directly, and potentially affects the set `dis` and the variable `ans` based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

- If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement, it will no longer be equal to `b[a[be]]` after the decrement, which might cause `a[be]` to be removed from the set `dis` if it was present.
- If `a[be]` was in `dis` and `mem[a[be]]` is no longer equal to `b[a[be]]`, `a[be]` will be removed from `dis`.
- If the length of `dis` was equal to `all` and `a[be]` is removed from `dis`, the length of `dis` will decrease, and `ans` will not be updated to include `be + 1`.

Given these considerations, the output state is:

Output State: **All other variables remain unchanged, the updated value of `mem[a[be]]` is `mem[a[be]] - 1`. If `mem[a[be]]` was equal to `b[a[be]]` before the decrement and `a[be]` was in the set `dis`, then `a[be]` is removed from `dis`. If the length of `dis` is no longer equal to `all`, `ans` does not include the value `be + 1`.**
