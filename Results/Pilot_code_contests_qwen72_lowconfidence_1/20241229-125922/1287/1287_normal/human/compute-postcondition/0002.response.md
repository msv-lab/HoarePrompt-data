The provided code snippet updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `ans`. Here’s the detailed impact:

1. `a` is assigned the result of calling `rints()`, which reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts each part into an integer, returning a list of these integers. This means `a` is now a list of integers read from input.

2. `b` is assigned the result of calling `Counter(rints())`, which also reads a line from standard input, splits it, and converts each part into an integer. However, this list is then passed to the `Counter` function from the `collections` module, which counts the frequency of each element in the list and returns a dictionary-like object (Counter) with elements as keys and their counts as values. This means `b` is now a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of the integers read from input.

3. `ans` is initialized as an empty list `[]`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `q` are positive integers read from the input, `p` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ p ≤ 2·10^5; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `b` is a `Counter` object representing the frequencies of integers read from input; `ans` is an empty list.**
