You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Quite recently, a very smart student named Jury decided that lectures are boring, so he downloaded a game called "Black Square" on his super cool touchscreen phone.

In this game, the phone's screen is divided into four vertical strips. Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly ai calories on touching the i-th strip.

You've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a1, a2, a3, a4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, a4 (0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104).

The second line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), where the і-th character of the string equals "1", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, "2", if it appears on the second strip, "3", if it appears on the third strip, "4", if it appears on the fourth strip.

Output

Print a single integer — the total number of calories that Jury wastes.

Program:
```
def func_1():
    c = [0] * 5
    for i in range(1, 5):
        c[i] = int(input())
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += c[int(ch)]
    print(res)
    return


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
