Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the input correctly as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the first line of input contains four space-separated integers, but the program attempts to read these integers one by one in a loop, which will lead to incorrect behavior. The correct way to read the input would be to use `input().split()` to read all four values at once and convert them to integers. The annotated version confirms that the program reads the integers one by one, which is inconsistent with the problem's input format. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
