You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Quite recently, a very smart student named Jury decided that lectures are boring, so he downloaded a game called "Black Square" on his super cool touchscreen phone.

In this game, the phone's screen is divided into four vertical strips. Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly ai calories on touching the i-th strip.

You've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a1, a2, a3, a4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, a4 (0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104).

The second line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), where the і-th character of the string equals "1", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, "2", if it appears on the second strip, "3", if it appears on the third strip, "4", if it appears on the fourth strip.

Output

Print a single integer — the total number of calories that Jury wastes.

Program:
```
def func_1():
    c = [0] * 5
    for i in range(1, 5):
        c[i] = int(input())
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += c[int(ch)]
    print(res)
    return


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, it expects separate inputs for each of the four integers `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` in a loop, which is not how the problem description specifies the input should be handled. The problem description states that the first line contains four space-separated integers, but the program attempts to read them one by one using `input()`, which will result in incorrect behavior. The correct way to read the input would be to use `input().split()` to read all four values at once and convert them to integers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += a[int(ch) - 1]
    print(res)
    return
```

This version correctly reads the four integers in a single line and processes the string `s` as described in the problem.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, a2, a3, a4 are integers where 0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104, and s is a string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105, consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'.
def func_1():
    c = [0] * 5
    for i in range(1, 5):
        c[i] = int(input())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a string of length \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5\) consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += c[int(ch)]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4, `res` is the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `res` remains 0.
    print(res)
    return
    #The program returns `res`, which is the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `res` remains 0.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
