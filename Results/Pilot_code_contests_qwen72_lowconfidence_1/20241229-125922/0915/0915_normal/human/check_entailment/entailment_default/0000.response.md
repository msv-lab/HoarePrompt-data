Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads four integers representing the calories burned for touching each strip (1 to 4) and stores them in a list `c` (with indices 1 to 4). This aligns with the problem description which states that the first line contains four space-separated integers.

2. **String Input**: The program then reads a string `s` which represents the sequence of seconds where a black square appears on one of the strips. This string is processed character by character, and the corresponding calorie value is added to the result `res`.

3. **Calculation**: For each character in the string `s`, the program converts the character to an integer and uses it as an index to look up the calorie value in the list `c`. The calorie value is then added to the running total `res`.

4. **Output**: After processing all characters in the string `s`, the program prints the total number of calories burned, which is stored in `res`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the string `s` is empty by printing 0, as the sum of calories would be zero if no squares appear.

6. **Correctness Verification**: The provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly:
   - For input `1 2 3 4` and `123214`, the output is `13`.
   - For input `1 5 3 2` and `11221`, the output is `13`.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
