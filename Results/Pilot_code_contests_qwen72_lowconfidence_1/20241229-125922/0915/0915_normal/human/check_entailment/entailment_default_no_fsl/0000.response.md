Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program reads the input values for `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` using `input()` in a loop, which means it expects the user to input these values one by one. However, according to the problem description, the input format specifies that the four integers `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` are provided on a single line, separated by spaces. This discrepancy means that the program will not work correctly if the input is provided in the format specified by the problem description.

For example, if the input is:
```
1 2 3 4
123214
```
The program will attempt to read each integer separately, which will result in an error because it will not receive the expected input format.

To fix this, the program should read the four integers in a single line and split them accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    c = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += c[int(ch)]
    print(res)
    return
```

This version reads the four integers in a single line and splits them into a list, which matches the input format specified in the problem description. With this correction, the program will work correctly for all potential cases.
