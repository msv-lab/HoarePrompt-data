Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads four integers (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`) from the user and stores them in a list `c` with indices 1 to 4. This matches the problem description, which states that the first line contains four space-separated integers.
   - The program then reads a string `s` from the user, which represents the sequence of seconds during the game. This matches the problem description, which states that the second line contains a string of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'.

2. **Calculating Calories:**
   - The program initializes a variable `res` to 0, which will store the total number of calories spent.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s`. For each character, it converts the character to an integer and uses it to index into the list `c` to get the corresponding calorie cost. It adds this cost to `res`.
   - This matches the problem description, which requires calculating the total number of calories spent based on the sequence of squares appearing on the strips.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `res`, which is the total number of calories spent. This matches the problem description, which states that the output should be a single integer representing the total number of calories.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string `s` is empty, the program will correctly print 0 because `res` will remain 0 after the loop. This is consistent with the problem description, which implies that no calories are spent if no squares appear.

Given that the program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly calculates the total number of calories spent, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
