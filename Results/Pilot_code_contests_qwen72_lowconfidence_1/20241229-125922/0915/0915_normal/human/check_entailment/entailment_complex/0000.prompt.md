You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Quite recently, a very smart student named Jury decided that lectures are boring, so he downloaded a game called "Black Square" on his super cool touchscreen phone.

In this game, the phone's screen is divided into four vertical strips. Each second, a black square appears on some of the strips. According to the rules of the game, Jury must use this second to touch the corresponding strip to make the square go away. As Jury is both smart and lazy, he counted that he wastes exactly ai calories on touching the i-th strip.

You've got a string s, describing the process of the game and numbers a1, a2, a3, a4. Calculate how many calories Jury needs to destroy all the squares?

Input

The first line contains four space-separated integers a1, a2, a3, a4 (0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104).

The second line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), where the і-th character of the string equals "1", if on the i-th second of the game the square appears on the first strip, "2", if it appears on the second strip, "3", if it appears on the third strip, "4", if it appears on the fourth strip.

Output

Print a single integer — the total number of calories that Jury wastes.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a1, a2, a3, a4 are integers where 0 ≤ a1, a2, a3, a4 ≤ 104, and s is a string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105, consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'.
def func_1():
    c = [0] * 5
    for i in range(1, 5):
        c[i] = int(input())
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a string of length \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5\) consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += c[int(ch)]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4, `res` is the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `res` remains 0.
    print(res)
    return
    #The program returns `res`, which is the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `res` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads four integers from user input and stores them in a list `c` (with indices 1 to 4). It then reads a string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'. The function calculates the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s` and prints this sum. The function does not return any value. If `s` is empty, the function prints 0. Note that the function does not accept any parameters; it only interacts with the user through standard input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
