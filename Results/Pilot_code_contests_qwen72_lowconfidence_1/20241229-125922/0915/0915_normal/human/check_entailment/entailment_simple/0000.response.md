Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program provided correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step analysis of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes a list `c` with 5 elements, all set to 0. This list will store the calorie costs for touching each strip.
   - It then reads four integers from the input, representing the calorie costs for touching the strips 1 through 4, and stores these values in the list `c` at indices 1 to 4. This matches the requirement that the first line of input contains four integers \(a1, a2, a3, a4\).

2. **Reading the Game Process:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input, which represents the sequence of squares appearing on the strips. This string is guaranteed to contain only the characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', as specified in the problem description.

3. **Calculating Total Calories:**
   - The program initializes a variable `res` to 0, which will store the total number of calories spent.
   - It iterates over each character `ch` in the string `s`. For each character, it converts the character to an integer and uses this integer as an index to look up the corresponding calorie cost from the list `c`. It adds this cost to `res`.
   - This correctly calculates the total number of calories spent by summing up the costs for each strip touched during the game process.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `res`, which is the total number of calories spent. This matches the output requirement of the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles the input as specified, processes the data according to the rules, and produces the expected output, it meets all the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
