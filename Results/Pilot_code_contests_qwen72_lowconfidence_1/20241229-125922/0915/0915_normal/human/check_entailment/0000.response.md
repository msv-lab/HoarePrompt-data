Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly. According to the problem description, the input values for `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` should be read in a single line separated by spaces, but the current implementation reads each value in a separate call to `input()`. This will cause the program to fail when given the input in the format specified in the problem description. For example, if the input is:

```
1 2 3 4
123214
```

The program will only read the first value (1) and then wait for additional inputs, which will not match the expected input format. To fix this, the input for `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` should be read in a single line and split into individual values. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += a[int(ch) - 1]
    print(res)
    return
```
