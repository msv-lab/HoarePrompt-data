Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the input correctly. Specifically, it expects separate inputs for each of the four integers `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, and `a4` in a loop, which is not how the problem description specifies the input should be handled. The problem description states that the first line contains four space-separated integers, but the program attempts to read them one by one using `input()`, which will result in incorrect behavior. The correct way to read the input would be to use `input().split()` to read all four values at once and convert them to integers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    res = 0
    for ch in s:
        res += a[int(ch) - 1]
    print(res)
    return
```

This version correctly reads the four integers in a single line and processes the string `s` as described in the problem.
