The code `c[i] = int(input())` updates the list `c` at index `i` (which is 3) with the integer value obtained from the user input. Since `i` is 3, the fourth element in the list `c` is updated.

- `c` initially is `[0, input_integer, int(input()), 0, 0]`.
- After the code executes, `c` becomes `[0, input_integer, int(input()), int(input()), 0]`.

The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `s`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a string of length \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5\) consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer, int(input()), int(input()), 0]`, `i` is 3**
