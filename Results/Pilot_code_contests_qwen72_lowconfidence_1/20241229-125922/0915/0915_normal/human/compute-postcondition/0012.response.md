To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\).
- `s` is a non-empty input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'.
- `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`.
- `i` is 4.
- `res` is `input_integer_ch` where `ch` is the first character of `s` converted to an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for ch in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character `ch` in the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`ch`**: At the start of the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - **`i`**: The variable `i` is not directly related to the loop control, but it is part of the state. Since `i` is 4 at the end of the previous iteration, it remains 4 unless modified within the loop body.
   - **`res`**: The value of `res` is determined by the first character of `s` converted to an integer. For the next iteration, `res` will be updated based on the new character `ch`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `s` must be considered. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` remain unchanged.
- `s` remains the same, but the next character `ch` will be the second character of `s`.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 4.
- `res` will be updated to the integer value of the next character `ch` in `s`.

### Final State:
State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a non-empty input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4, `res` is `input_integer_ch` where `ch` is the second character of `s` converted to an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4)**.
