The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the description, it is implied that the function works with parameters `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and `s`. These parameters are used to construct a list `c` where `c[0] = a1`, `c[1] = a2`, `c[2] = a3`, and `c[3] = a4`. The function then processes the string `s` by converting each character to an integer index and summing the corresponding values from `c`. If `s` is empty, the result `res` remains 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integers `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, and a string `s` consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'. It returns the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s`. If `s` is empty, it returns 0.
