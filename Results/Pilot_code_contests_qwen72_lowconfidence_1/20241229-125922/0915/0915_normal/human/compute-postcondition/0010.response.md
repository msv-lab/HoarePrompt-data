To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the components involved:

- `s` is a new input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'.
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

For the loop to execute, the string `s` must be non-empty. The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`, `c`, `i`, `res`) do not directly affect whether the loop runs, but they may be relevant within the loop body.

Given the initial state:
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\)
- `s` is a new input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'
- `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`
- `i` is 4
- `res` is 0

The critical condition for the loop to execute is that `s` must contain at least one character. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `s` is non-empty.

State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a non-empty input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4, `res` is 0**
