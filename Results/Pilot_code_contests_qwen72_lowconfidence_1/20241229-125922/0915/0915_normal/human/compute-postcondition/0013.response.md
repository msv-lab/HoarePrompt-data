The code snippet `res += c[int(ch)]` updates the value of `res` by adding the value at index `int(ch)` in the list `c`. Here's the detailed impact:

- `res` was initially set to `input_integer_ch`, where `ch` is the second character of `s` converted to an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- The value of `c[int(ch)]` is added to `res`.
- The value of `c[int(ch)]` corresponds to one of the input integers (`input_integer_1`, `input_integer_2`, `input_integer_3`, or `input_integer_4`) based on the value of `ch`.

Thus, the new value of `res` is `input_integer_ch + input_integer_ch`.

The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4` are integers where \(0 \leq a1, a2, a3, a4 \leq 10^4\), `s` is a non-empty input string consisting of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4', `c` is `[0, input_integer_1, input_integer_2, input_integer_3, input_integer_4]`, `i` is 4, `res` is `input_integer_ch + input_integer_ch` where `ch` is the second character of `s` converted to an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4)**.
