Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads four integers from user input and stores them in a list `c` (with indices 1 to 4). It then reads a string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'. The function calculates the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s` and prints this sum. The function does not return any value. If `s` is empty, the function prints 0. Note that the function does not accept any parameters; it only interacts with the user through standard input. **

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
- If the input integers are outside the expected range (0 to 10^4), the function does not handle this and will proceed with whatever values are provided.
- If the input string `s` contains characters other than '1', '2', '3', and '4', the function will raise an error when trying to index `c` with an invalid integer.
- The function does not validate the length of the input string `s` or the range of the input integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs are not as expected.
