The function `func_1` reads four integers from user input and stores them in a list `c` (with indices 1 to 4). It then reads a string `s` from user input, where `s` consists of characters '1', '2', '3', and '4'. The function calculates the sum of the values in `c` indexed by the integer representation of each character in `s` and prints this sum. The function does not return any value. If `s` is empty, the function prints 0. Note that the function does not accept any parameters; it only interacts with the user through standard input.
