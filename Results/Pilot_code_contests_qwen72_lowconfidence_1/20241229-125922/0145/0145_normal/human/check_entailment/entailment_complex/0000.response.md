Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the equivalence check as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1`, particularly in how it handles the base cases and recursive calls.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` has a condition to check if `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2`. This condition is not aligned with the problem description. According to the problem, the base case should be when the length of the substring is 1 (i.e., `j1 - i1 == 1`), and the strings are equivalent if they are equal.
   - The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is overly restrictive and does not cover all possible base cases. For example, if the length of the substring is 3, the function will incorrectly return `False` even though it should be checked further.

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls in `func_1` are not correctly structured to handle the problem's requirements. The function should recursively check both possible splits (i.e., `a1` with `b1` and `a2` with `b2`, or `a1` with `b2` and `a2` with `b1`). However, the current implementation only checks one split and then recursively calls itself with the same split, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
Input:
aabb
bbaa
```
According to the problem description, these strings should be equivalent because they can be split into `a1 = "aa"`, `a2 = "bb"`, `b1 = "bb"`, and `b2 = "aa"`, and `a1` is equivalent to `b2` and `a2` is equivalent to `b1`.

However, the current implementation will return `False` because the base case condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is not satisfied for the length 4, and it will incorrectly handle the recursive calls.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results for some valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
