You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: 

  1. They are equal. 
  2. If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct: 
    1. a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
    2. a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1



As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.

Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!

Input

The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200 000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

aaba
abaa


Output

YES


Input

aabb
abab


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one â€” into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".

In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".

    #The program returns the result of a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to `func_1`. The expression evaluates the AND and OR of the results from these calls, using substrings of `text1` and `text2` defined by the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the content of `text1` and `text2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two strings `text1` and `text2` of equal length, along with their respective substring indices `i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`, and two objects `hash1` and `hash2` that provide a `substring_hash` method. It determines if certain substrings of `text1` and `text2` have matching hash values. Specifically, it checks if the hash values of specified substrings match based on the following conditions:

1. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is not a multiple of 4 or is equal to 2, the function calculates the hash values of the left and right halves of the substrings (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). It then compares these hash values and returns:
   - `True` if `a1 == b1` and `a2 == b2`.
   - `False` if `a1 != b1` and `a2 != b1`.
   - `False` if none of the above conditions are met.

2. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is a multiple of 4 and not equal to 2, the function recursively calls itself with different combinations of the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. It returns the result of a logical expression involving these recursive calls, which can be a combination of `AND` and `OR` operations.

The function does not modify the input strings or the hash objects. It only returns a boolean value indicating the result of the hash value comparisons or the result of the recursive calls. Edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings are not explicitly handled in the provided code, but the function should work correctly for non-empty strings of equal length.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: text1 and text2 are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have the same length.
def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)
    #The program returns the result of `func_1` with parameters (`text1`, `text2`, 0, `len(text1)`, 0, `len(text2)`, `hash1`, `hash2`). `text1` and `text2` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and have the same length; `hash1` is the hash representation of `text1`; `hash2` is the hash representation of `text2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `text1` and `text2`, which are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and are of the same length. It computes the hash representations of `text1` and `text2` using a `Hasher` function and then calls another function `func_1` with these hashes and additional parameters derived from the lengths of `text1` and `text2`. The function returns the result of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the original strings `text1` and `text2` remain unchanged, and the state of the program includes the computed hash values, although these are not directly accessible outside the function. The function assumes that `func_1` will handle the hashes and other parameters correctly, but the specific behavior of `func_1` is not detailed in the provided code. Edge cases such as empty strings or very long strings are not explicitly handled in the code, and the behavior of `func_1` under these conditions is unknown.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and their lengths are equal and within the range 1 to 200,000.
def func_3():
    s1 = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    print(func_2(s1, s2))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads two strings, `s1` and `s2`, from user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with these two strings as arguments and prints the result. The function `func_2` is expected to determine if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. However, `func_3` itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the program will have printed either `True` or `False` depending on whether the two input strings are anagrams. The function assumes that the input strings are valid (i.e., they consist of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths), but it does not validate this assumption. If the input strings do not meet these criteria, the behavior of `func_2` and consequently `func_3` is undefined.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
