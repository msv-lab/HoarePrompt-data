Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: This function is specific to Python 2, while the problem statement does not specify the version of Python. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**: The `Hasher` class is mentioned but not defined in the provided code. Without the implementation of the `Hasher` class, the hashing mechanism used in `func_1` cannot be verified, and it may not work as intended.

3. **Mid Calculation**: The calculation of `mid1` and `mid2` in `func_1` uses integer division, which might lead to incorrect indices if the length of the string is odd. The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is not clearly explained and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

4. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` do not handle the base case properly. For example, if the length of the substrings is 1, the function should directly compare the characters. However, the current implementation does not handle this explicitly.

5. **Substring Hashing**: The `substring_hash` method is assumed to exist in the `Hasher` class, but without its implementation, it's impossible to verify if it works correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
