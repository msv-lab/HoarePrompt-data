Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the equivalence check as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` has a logical flaw in its base case handling and recursive calls. Here are the issues:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is incorrect. The problem statement does not specify any special treatment for substrings whose lengths are not multiples of 4 or are equal to 2. Instead, the base case should simply be when the substrings are of length 1, in which case they are equivalent if and only if they are equal.

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls in `func_1` are not correctly structured to handle the equivalence conditions as described. The function should check both possible ways of splitting the strings (i.e., `a1` with `b1` and `a2` with `b2`, or `a1` with `b2` and `a2` with `b1`) without the unnecessary condition on the length being a multiple of 4.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where the strings are of length 1 correctly. For strings of length 1, the function should simply compare the characters directly.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function that adheres to the problem description:

```python
def func_1(text1, text2, i1, j1, i2, j2, hash1, hash2):
    if j1 - i1 == 1:  # Base case: length 1
        return text1[i1] == text2[i2]

    mid1 = (i1 + j1) // 2
    mid2 = (i2 + j2) // 2

    # Check both possible ways of splitting
    return (func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2)) or \
           (func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2))
```

With this correction, the function should correctly determine if two strings are equivalent according to the problem description. However, the current implementation does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
