Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: As noted in the original assessment, `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. Since the problem statement does not specify the version of Python, using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a `NameError`. This is a clear issue that affects the program's correctness.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**: The `Hasher` class is mentioned but not defined in the provided code. Without the implementation of the `Hasher` class, the hashing mechanism used in `func_1` cannot be verified, and it may not work as intended. This is a significant issue because the correctness of the program relies on the proper functioning of the `Hasher` class.

3. **Mid Calculation**: The calculation of `mid1` and `mid2` in `func_1` uses integer division, which might lead to incorrect indices if the length of the string is odd. The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is not clearly explained and might not handle all edge cases correctly. This could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

4. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` do not handle the base case properly. For example, if the length of the substrings is 1, the function should directly compare the characters. However, the current implementation does not handle this explicitly, which could lead to incorrect results.

5. **Substring Hashing**: The `substring_hash` method is assumed to exist in the `Hasher` class, but without its implementation, it's impossible to verify if it works correctly. This is another critical issue that affects the program's correctness.

6. **Output Hints**: The output hints suggest that `func_3` is expected to determine if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other, which is not consistent with the problem description. The problem description requires determining if two strings are equivalent based on the given rules, not if they are anagrams. This discrepancy further supports the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
