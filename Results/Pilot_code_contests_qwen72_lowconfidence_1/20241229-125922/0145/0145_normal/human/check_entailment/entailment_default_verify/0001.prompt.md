You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: 

  1. They are equal. 
  2. If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct: 
    1. a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
    2. a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1



As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.

Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!

Input

The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200 000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

aaba
abaa


Output

YES


Input

aabb
abab


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one â€” into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".

In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(text1, text2, i1, j1, i2, j2, hash1, hash2):
    mid1 = int((j1 + i1) / 2)
    mid2 = int((j2 + i2) / 2)
    if (j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2:
        a1 = hash1.substring_hash(i1, mid1)
        a2 = hash1.substring_hash(mid1, j1)
        b1 = hash2.substring_hash(i2, mid2)
        b2 = hash2.substring_hash(mid2, j2)
        if a1 == b1:
            return a2 == b2
        elif a2 == b1:
            return a1 == b2
        return False
    return func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2) or (func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2))

#Function 2:
def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    s1 = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    print(func_2(s1, s2))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: This function is specific to Python 2, while the problem statement does not specify the version of Python. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**: The `Hasher` class is mentioned but not defined in the provided code. Without the implementation of the `Hasher` class, the hashing mechanism used in `func_1` cannot be verified, and it may not work as intended.

3. **Mid Calculation**: The calculation of `mid1` and `mid2` in `func_1` uses integer division, which might lead to incorrect indices if the length of the string is odd. The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is not clearly explained and might not handle all edge cases correctly.

4. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` do not handle the base case properly. For example, if the length of the substrings is 1, the function should directly compare the characters. However, the current implementation does not handle this explicitly.

5. **Substring Hashing**: The `substring_hash` method is assumed to exist in the `Hasher` class, but without its implementation, it's impossible to verify if it works correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads two strings, `s1` and `s2`, from user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with these two strings as arguments and prints the result. The function `func_2` is expected to determine if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. However, `func_3` itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the program will have printed either `True` or `False` depending on whether the two input strings are anagrams. The function assumes that the input strings are valid (i.e., they consist of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths), but it does not validate this assumption. If the input strings do not meet these criteria, the behavior of `func_2` and consequently `func_3` is undefined.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
