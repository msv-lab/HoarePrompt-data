You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: 

  1. They are equal. 
  2. If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct: 
    1. a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
    2. a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1



As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.

Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!

Input

The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200 000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

aaba
abaa


Output

YES


Input

aabb
abab


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one â€” into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".

In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes two strings `text1` and `text2` of equal length, along with their respective substring indices `i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`, and two objects `hash1` and `hash2` that provide a `substring_hash` method. It determines if certain substrings of `text1` and `text2` have matching hash values. Specifically, it checks if the hash values of specified substrings match based on the following conditions:

1. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is not a multiple of 4 or is equal to 2, the function calculates the hash values of the left and right halves of the substrings (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). It then compares these hash values and returns:
   - `True` if `a1 == b1` and `a2 == b2`.
   - `False` if `a1 != b1` and `a2 != b1`.
   - `False` if none of the above conditions are met.

2. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is a multiple of 4 and not equal to 2, the function recursively calls itself with different combinations of the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. It returns the result of a logical expression involving these recursive calls, which can be a combination of `AND` and `OR` operations.

The function does not modify the input strings or the hash objects. It only returns a boolean value indicating the result of the hash value comparisons or the result of the recursive calls. Edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings are not explicitly handled in the provided code, but the function should work correctly for non-empty strings of equal length.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `text1` and `text2`, which are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and are of the same length. It computes the hash representations of `text1` and `text2` using a `Hasher` function and then calls another function `func_1` with these hashes and additional parameters derived from the lengths of `text1` and `text2`. The function returns the result of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the original strings `text1` and `text2` remain unchanged, and the state of the program includes the computed hash values, although these are not directly accessible outside the function. The function assumes that `func_1` will handle the hashes and other parameters correctly, but the specific behavior of `func_1` is not detailed in the provided code. Edge cases such as empty strings or very long strings are not explicitly handled in the code, and the behavior of `func_1` under these conditions is unknown.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s1 = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    print(func_2(s1, s2))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads two strings, `s1` and `s2`, from user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with these two strings as arguments and prints the result. The function `func_2` is expected to determine if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. However, `func_3` itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the program will have printed either `True` or `False` depending on whether the two input strings are anagrams. The function assumes that the input strings are valid (i.e., they consist of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths), but it does not validate this assumption. If the input strings do not meet these criteria, the behavior of `func_2` and consequently `func_3` is undefined.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
