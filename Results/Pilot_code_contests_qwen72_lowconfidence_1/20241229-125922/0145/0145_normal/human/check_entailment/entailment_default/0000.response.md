Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining if two strings are equivalent according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` contains a logical error in its base case and recursive case handling. Here are the issues:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the base case when the length of the substring is not a multiple of 4 or is equal to 2. This condition is not aligned with the problem's requirement for splitting the string into two halves. The problem requires checking if the strings are equal or if they can be split into halves that are equivalent. The current implementation does not correctly handle the base case where the substrings are of length 1 or 2.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: The recursive calls in `func_1` are not correctly structured to ensure that all possible splits are checked. The function should recursively check both possible splits (a1 with b1 and a2 with b2, or a1 with b2 and a2 with b1) without the unnecessary condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases such as single-character strings or empty strings, which should be straightforward to check for equivalence.

To fix these issues, the function should be rewritten to correctly handle the base case and recursive case according to the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(text1, text2, i1, j1, i2, j2, hash1, hash2):
    if j1 - i1 == 1:  # Base case: single character
        return text1[i1] == text2[i2]
    
    mid1 = (i1 + j1) // 2
    mid2 = (i2 + j2) // 2
    
    a1 = hash1.substring_hash(i1, mid1)
    a2 = hash1.substring_hash(mid1, j1)
    b1 = hash2.substring_hash(i2, mid2)
    b2 = hash2.substring_hash(mid2, j2)
    
    return (a1 == b1 and a2 == b2) or (a1 == b2 and a2 == b1)

def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)

def func_3():
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print("YES" if func_2(s1, s2) else "NO")
```

This corrected version ensures that the base case is correctly handled and the recursive calls check both possible splits. With this correction, the program should meet the problem description for every potential case.
