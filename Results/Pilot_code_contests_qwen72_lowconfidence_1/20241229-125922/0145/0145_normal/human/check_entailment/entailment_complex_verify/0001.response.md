Final: **False**

Reasoning:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The original assessment correctly points out that `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. The problem description does not specify the Python version, and using `raw_input()` in Python 3 will result in a `NameError`. This is a significant issue that makes the program incorrect.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**: The `Hasher` class is defined in the annotated code, which was not present in the original code. However, the hashing mechanism itself is complex and relies on the correctness of the `Hasher` class and the `substring_hash` method. While the annotated code provides a detailed implementation, it is still a potential point of failure if the hashing logic is not correct.

3. **Mid Calculation**: The calculation of `mid1` and `mid2` in `func_1` uses integer division. The condition `(j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2` is not clearly explained and might not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the length of the substrings is odd, the mid calculation might lead to incorrect indices.

4. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls in `func_1` do not handle the base case properly. For example, if the length of the substrings is 1, the function should directly compare the characters. However, the current implementation does not handle this explicitly, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Substring Hashing**: The `substring_hash` method is assumed to exist in the `Hasher` class, and the annotated code provides an implementation. However, without a thorough verification of the hashing logic, it is difficult to ensure that it works correctly for all cases.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of **False** is accurate.
