You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases: 

  1. They are equal. 
  2. If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct: 
    1. a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
    2. a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1



As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent.

Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!

Input

The first two lines of the input contain two strings given by the teacher. Each of them has the length from 1 to 200 000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes), if these two strings are equivalent, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

aaba
abaa


Output

YES


Input

aabb
abab


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample you should split the first string into strings "aa" and "ba", the second one â€” into strings "ab" and "aa". "aa" is equivalent to "aa"; "ab" is equivalent to "ba" as "ab" = "a" + "b", "ba" = "b" + "a".

In the second sample the first string can be splitted into strings "aa" and "bb", that are equivalent only to themselves. That's why string "aabb" is equivalent only to itself and to string "bbaa".
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(text1, text2, i1, j1, i2, j2, hash1, hash2):
    mid1 = int((j1 + i1) / 2)
    mid2 = int((j2 + i2) / 2)
    if (j1 - i1) % 4 != 0 or j1 - i1 == 2:
        a1 = hash1.substring_hash(i1, mid1)
        a2 = hash1.substring_hash(mid1, j1)
        b1 = hash2.substring_hash(i2, mid2)
        b2 = hash2.substring_hash(mid2, j2)
        if a1 == b1:
            return a2 == b2
        elif a2 == b1:
            return a1 == b2
        return False
    return func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2) or (func_1(text1, text2, i1, mid1, mid2, j2, hash1, hash2) and func_1(text1, text2, mid1, j1, i2, mid2, hash1, hash2))

#Function 2:
def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    s1 = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    print(func_2(s1, s2))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
