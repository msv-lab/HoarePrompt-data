Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling Odd-Length Strings**: The function `func_1` assumes that the strings are always of even length or lengths that are multiples of 4. However, the problem description states that the strings can be of any length from 1 to 200,000. This means the function will fail for strings of odd lengths or lengths that are not multiples of 4.

2. **Hashing Mechanism**: The `Hasher` class is mentioned but not defined in the provided code. Without the implementation of the `Hasher` class, it's impossible to verify if the hashing mechanism works correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the strings are of length 1 or 2 correctly. For example, if both strings are of length 1, they should be considered equivalent if they are the same character. Similarly, for strings of length 2, the function should check if they are equivalent directly without further recursion.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

- **Input**: 
  ```
  ab
  ba
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Actual Output**: 
  The program will likely return `NO` because it does not handle strings of length 2 correctly.

To fix these issues, the program needs to handle all possible string lengths and ensure that the `Hasher` class is properly implemented and used. Additionally, edge cases for short strings should be explicitly handled.
