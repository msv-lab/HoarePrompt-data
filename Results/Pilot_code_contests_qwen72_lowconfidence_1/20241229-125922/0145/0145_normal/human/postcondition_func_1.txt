The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `text1` and `text2`, which are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and are of the same length. It computes the hash representations of `text1` and `text2` using a `Hasher` function and then calls another function `func_1` with these hashes and additional parameters derived from the lengths of `text1` and `text2`. The function returns the result of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the original strings `text1` and `text2` remain unchanged, and the state of the program includes the computed hash values, although these are not directly accessible outside the function. The function assumes that `func_1` will handle the hashes and other parameters correctly, but the specific behavior of `func_1` is not detailed in the provided code. Edge cases such as empty strings or very long strings are not explicitly handled in the code, and the behavior of `func_1` under these conditions is unknown.
