text1 and text2 are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, i1, j1, i2, j2 are integers where 0 <= i1 <= j1 <= len(text1) and 0 <= i2 <= j2 <= len(text2), hash1 and hash2 are objects that provide a substring_hash method which returns a hash value for the substring defined by the indices passed to it.
