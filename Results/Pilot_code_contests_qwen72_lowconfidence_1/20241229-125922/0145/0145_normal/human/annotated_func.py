    #The program returns the result of a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to `func_1`. The expression evaluates the AND and OR of the results from these calls, using substrings of `text1` and `text2` defined by the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the content of `text1` and `text2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two strings `text1` and `text2` of equal length, along with their respective substring indices `i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`, and two objects `hash1` and `hash2` that provide a `substring_hash` method. It determines if certain substrings of `text1` and `text2` have matching hash values. Specifically, it checks if the hash values of specified substrings match based on the following conditions:

1. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is not a multiple of 4 or is equal to 2, the function calculates the hash values of the left and right halves of the substrings (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). It then compares these hash values and returns:
   - `True` if `a1 == b1` and `a2 == b2`.
   - `False` if `a1 != b1` and `a2 != b1`.
   - `False` if none of the above conditions are met.

2. If the length of the substring defined by `j1 - i1` is a multiple of 4 and not equal to 2, the function recursively calls itself with different combinations of the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. It returns the result of a logical expression involving these recursive calls, which can be a combination of `AND` and `OR` operations.

The function does not modify the input strings or the hash objects. It only returns a boolean value indicating the result of the hash value comparisons or the result of the recursive calls. Edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings are not explicitly handled in the provided code, but the function should work correctly for non-empty strings of equal length.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: text1 and text2 are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have the same length.
def func_2(text1, text2):
    hash1 = Hasher(text1)
    hash2 = Hasher(text2)
    return func_1(text1, text2, 0, len(text1), 0, len(text2), hash1, hash2)
    #The program returns the result of `func_1` with parameters (`text1`, `text2`, 0, `len(text1)`, 0, `len(text2)`, `hash1`, `hash2`). `text1` and `text2` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and have the same length; `hash1` is the hash representation of `text1`; `hash2` is the hash representation of `text2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two parameters, `text1` and `text2`, which are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and are of the same length. It computes the hash representations of `text1` and `text2` using a `Hasher` function and then calls another function `func_1` with these hashes and additional parameters derived from the lengths of `text1` and `text2`. The function returns the result of `func_1`. After the function concludes, the original strings `text1` and `text2` remain unchanged, and the state of the program includes the computed hash values, although these are not directly accessible outside the function. The function assumes that `func_1` will handle the hashes and other parameters correctly, but the specific behavior of `func_1` is not detailed in the provided code. Edge cases such as empty strings or very long strings are not explicitly handled in the code, and the behavior of `func_1` under these conditions is unknown.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and their lengths are equal and within the range 1 to 200,000.
def func_3():
    s1 = raw_input()
    s2 = raw_input()
    print(func_2(s1, s2))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads two strings, `s1` and `s2`, from user input. It then calls another function `func_2` with these two strings as arguments and prints the result. The function `func_2` is expected to determine if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other, returning `True` if they are and `False` otherwise. However, `func_3` itself does not return any value. After the function completes, the program will have printed either `True` or `False` depending on whether the two input strings are anagrams. The function assumes that the input strings are valid (i.e., they consist of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths), but it does not validate this assumption. If the input strings do not meet these criteria, the behavior of `func_2` and consequently `func_3` is undefined.
