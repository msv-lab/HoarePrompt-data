The code assigns to `b1` the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `i2` to `mid2` using the `substring_hash` method of `hash2`. This impacts only the variable `b1`.

Given the initial conditions, the values of `text1`, `text2`, `i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`, `hash1`, `hash2`, `mid1`, `mid2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The only new information is the value of `b1`, which is now the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `i2` to `mid2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`text1` and `text2` are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, 0 <= `i1` <= `j1` <= len(`text1`), 0 <= `i2` <= `j2` <= len(`text2`), `hash1` and `hash2` are objects that provide a substring_hash method, `mid1` is `(j1 + i1) // 2`, `mid2` is `(j2 + i2) // 2`, the difference `j1 - i1` is either not a multiple of 4 or equal to 2, `a1` is the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `i1` to `mid1`, `a2` is the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `mid1` to `j1`, `b1` is the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `i2` to `mid2`.**
