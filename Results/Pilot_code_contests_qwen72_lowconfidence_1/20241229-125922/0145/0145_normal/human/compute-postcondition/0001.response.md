The value of `s2` is now updated to the string provided by the user through `raw_input()`. The length of `s2` is equal to the length of the string provided by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 200,000. The value of `s1` remains unchanged as it was initially set by the user and is not modified by the code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string provided by the user through `raw_input()`, `s2` is a string provided by the user through `raw_input()` and their lengths are equal and within the range 1 to 200,000.**
