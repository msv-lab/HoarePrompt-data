You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: text1 and text2 are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, i1, j1, i2, j2 are integers where 0 <= i1 <= j1 <= len(text1) and 0 <= i2 <= j2 <= len(text2), hash1 and hash2 are objects that provide a substring_hash method which returns a hash value for the substring defined by the indices passed to it.
```
def func_1(text1, text2, i1, j1, i2, j2, hash1, hash2):
```
Output: Case_1: The program returns whether the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `mid1` to `j1` (`a2`) is equal to the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `mid2` to `j2` (`b2`).

Case_2: The program returns False because `a1` is not equal to `b2`.

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns the result of a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to `func_1`. The expression evaluates the AND and OR of the results from these calls, using substrings of `text1` and `text2` defined by the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the content of `text1` and `text2`.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
