The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `text1`: A string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `text2`: A string consisting of lowercase English letters, of the same length as `text1`.
- `i1`, `j1`: Integers where 0 <= i1 <= j1 <= len(text1), defining a substring of `text1`.
- `i2`, `j2`: Integers where 0 <= i2 <= j2 <= len(text2), defining a substring of `text2`.
- `hash1`: An object that provides a `substring_hash` method, which returns a hash value for the substring of `text1` defined by the indices passed to it.
- `hash2`: An object that provides a `substring_hash` method, which returns a hash value for the substring of `text2` defined by the indices passed to it.

The function returns:
- **Case_1**: Whether the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `mid1` to `j1` (`a2`) is equal to the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `mid2` to `j2` (`b2`).
- **Case_2**: False, because `a1` is not equal to `b2`.
- **Case_3**: False.
- **Case_4**: The result of a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to `func_1`. The expression evaluates the AND and OR of the results from these calls, using substrings of `text1` and `text2` defined by the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the content of `text1` and `text2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two strings `text1` and `text2` of equal length, along with their respective substring indices `i1`, `j1`, `i2`, `j2`, and two objects `hash1` and `hash2` that provide a `substring_hash` method. It returns whether the hash values of specified substrings match, or a result from a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to itself, or False in specific cases.**
