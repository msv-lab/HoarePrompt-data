Postcondition: ***`text1` and `text2` are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, 0 <= `i1` <= `j1` <= len(`text1`), 0 <= `i2` <= `j2` <= len(`text2`), `hash1` and `hash2` are objects that provide a substring_hash method, `mid1` is `(j1 + i1) // 2`, `mid2` is `(j2 + i2) // 2`, the difference `j1 - i1` is either not a multiple of 4 or equal to 2, `a1` is the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `i1` to `mid1`, `a2` is the hash value of the substring of `text1` from `mid1` to `j1`, `b1` is the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `i2` to `mid2`, `b2` is the hash value of the substring of `text2` from `mid2` to `j2`, and `a1` is not equal to `b1`.***
