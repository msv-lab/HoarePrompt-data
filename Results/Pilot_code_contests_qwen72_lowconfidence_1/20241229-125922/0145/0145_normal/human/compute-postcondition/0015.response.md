Output State: **The program returns the result of a complex logical expression involving multiple calls to `func_1`. The expression evaluates the AND and OR of the results from these calls, using substrings of `text1` and `text2` defined by the indices `i1`, `mid1`, `j1`, `i2`, `mid2`, and `j2`. The exact value returned depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the content of `text1` and `text2`.**
