Postcondition: ***`text1` and `text2` are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, 0 <= `i1` <= `j1` <= len(`text1`), 0 <= `i2` <= `j2` <= len(`text2`), `hash1` and `hash2` are objects that provide a substring_hash method which returns a hash value for the substring defined by the indices passed to it, `mid1` is `(j1 + i1) // 2`, `mid2` is `(j2 + i2) // 2`, and (`(j1 - i1) % 4 == 0 and j1 - i1 != 2`)***
