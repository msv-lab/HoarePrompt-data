The function `func_3` accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`. Both `s1` and `s2` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and their lengths are equal and within the range 1 to 200,000. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `s1` and `s2`.

Since the specific output conditions are not provided, I will assume a common scenario where the function might check if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other (i.e., they contain the same characters in the same frequency).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `s1` and `s2`, both of which are strings consisting of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths within the range 1 to 200,000. The function returns `True` if `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other; otherwise, it returns `False`.**

If you have specific output conditions, please provide them so I can refine the description accordingly.
