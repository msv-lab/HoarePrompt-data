The provided code snippet calls the function `func_2` with `s1` and `s2` as arguments and prints the result. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact output of the function call. However, the impact of this code on the program state is minimal, as no new variables are introduced, and the existing variables (`s1` and `s2`) are not modified.

Output State: **`s1` is a string provided by the user through `raw_input()`, `s2` is a string provided by the user through `raw_input()`, their lengths are equal and within the range 1 to 200,000, and the result of `func_2(s1, s2)` is printed.**
