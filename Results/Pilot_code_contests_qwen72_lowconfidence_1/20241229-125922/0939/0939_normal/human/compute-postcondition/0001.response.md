The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts using spaces as delimiters, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`.

Output State: **N is an input integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, and A is now populated with the integers from the input.**
