Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`. If the count of odd integers is even, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the following: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( A_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( A_i \) ≤ 10^9, and the output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of the count of odd integers in `A`. Edge cases include when `N` is 2 (the minimum allowed value) and when all integers in `A` are even or all are odd. **
