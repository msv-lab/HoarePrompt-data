You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i.

Takahashi will repeatedly perform the following operation on these numbers:

* Select a pair of integers, A_i and A_j, that have the same parity (that is, both are even or both are odd) and erase them.
* Then, write a new integer on the blackboard that is equal to the sum of those integers, A_i+A_j.



Determine whether it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard.

Constraints

* 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9
* A_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 … A_N


Output

If it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard, print `YES`. Otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

NO
Program:
```
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    cnt = 0
    for a in A:
        cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0
    print('YES' if cnt % 2 == 0 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of all numbers on the blackboard remains unchanged through the operations. The program counts the number of odd numbers in the input list. If this count is even, it means the total sum of the numbers (considering their parities) can be combined into a single number, and thus the output is "YES". If the count is odd, it's impossible to end up with a single number, so the output is "NO". This logic holds for all potential cases within the given constraints.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    cnt = 0
    for a in A:
        cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer \( A_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( A_i \) ≤ 10^9, `cnt` is the number of odd integers in the list `A`.
    print('YES' if cnt % 2 == 0 else 'NO')


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
