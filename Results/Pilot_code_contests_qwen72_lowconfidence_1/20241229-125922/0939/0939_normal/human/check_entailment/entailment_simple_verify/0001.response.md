Final: **True**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations.
   - The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of all integers on the blackboard remains invariant under the operations.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to count the number of odd integers in the list `A`.
   - It iterates through the list `A` and increments `cnt` for each odd integer.
   - After the loop, it checks if `cnt` is even. If `cnt` is even, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

3. **Annotations and State**:
   - Before the function call: `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), and `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \(A_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\).
   - After the for loop: `N` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 10^5\), `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \(A_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9\), and `cnt` is the number of odd integers in the list `A`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`.
   - The condition `cnt % 2 == 0` ensures that the number of odd integers is even, which is necessary for the final integer to be a single integer on the blackboard.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description. The original assessment is accurate, and there is no need for changes based on the annotated version.
