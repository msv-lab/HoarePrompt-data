You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i.

Takahashi will repeatedly perform the following operation on these numbers:

* Select a pair of integers, A_i and A_j, that have the same parity (that is, both are even or both are odd) and erase them.
* Then, write a new integer on the blackboard that is equal to the sum of those integers, A_i+A_j.



Determine whether it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard.

Constraints

* 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9
* A_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 … A_N


Output

If it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard, print `YES`. Otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

NO
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, and A is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    cnt = 0
    for a in A:
        cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer \( A_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( A_i \) ≤ 10^9, `cnt` is the number of odd integers in the list `A`.
    print('YES' if cnt % 2 == 0 else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`. If the count of odd integers is even, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the following: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( A_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( A_i \) ≤ 10^9, and the output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of the count of odd integers in `A`. Edge cases include when `N` is 2 (the minimum allowed value) and when all integers in `A` are even or all are odd.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
