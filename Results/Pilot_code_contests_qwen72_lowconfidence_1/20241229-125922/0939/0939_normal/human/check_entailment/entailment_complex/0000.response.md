Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Let's break down why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers from the standard input. This matches the problem description's input format.

2. **Counting Odd Integers**:
   - The program iterates through the list `A` and counts the number of odd integers (`cnt`). This is done using the bitwise AND operation `a & 1` to check if an integer is odd.

3. **Determining the Result**:
   - The program checks if the count of odd integers (`cnt`) is even. If `cnt % 2 == 0`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Why This Logic is Correct:

- **Parity and Operations**:
  - The problem requires determining whether it is possible to end up with only one integer on the blackboard by repeatedly selecting pairs of integers with the same parity and replacing them with their sum.
  - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of two integers depends on their parities:
    - Sum of two even integers is even.
    - Sum of two odd integers is even.
    - Sum of an even and an odd integer is odd.
  - Therefore, the number of odd integers on the blackboard can only change by an even number (since each operation removes two odd integers and adds one even integer, or removes two even integers and adds one even integer).
  - For the final result to be a single integer, the initial number of odd integers must be even. If the initial count of odd integers is odd, it is impossible to end up with a single integer because the parity of the count of odd integers will always remain odd.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard based on the parity of the count of odd integers. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
