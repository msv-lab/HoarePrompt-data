Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of two integers depends only on the parity of the integers being added. Specifically, the sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers is even, while the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.

Given this, the program counts the number of odd integers in the list. If the count of odd integers is even, it means that we can pair all the odd integers with each other, and similarly, we can pair all the even integers with each other. This will result in a series of sums that are all even, and eventually, we can end up with a single even number on the blackboard. If the count of odd integers is odd, it is impossible to pair all the odd integers, and thus, it is impossible to end up with a single integer on the blackboard.

The program correctly handles all potential cases within the given constraints, including edge cases such as when `N` is 2, and when all integers in `A` are either even or all are odd. Therefore, the program is correct.
