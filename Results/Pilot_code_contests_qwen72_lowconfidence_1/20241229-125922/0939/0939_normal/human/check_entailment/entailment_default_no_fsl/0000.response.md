Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard based on the parity of the integers. Here's why the program works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Counting Odd Integers**: The program counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`. This is done using the expression `cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0`, which increments `cnt` for each odd integer.

2. **Parity Check**: The program checks if the count of odd integers (`cnt`) is even. If `cnt % 2 == 0`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Logical Correctness**:
   - **All Even Integers**: If all integers in `A` are even, the count of odd integers (`cnt`) is 0, which is even. The program correctly prints "YES".
   - **All Odd Integers**: If all integers in `A` are odd, the count of odd integers (`cnt`) is equal to `N`. Since `N` is even (as per the constraints), the program correctly prints "YES".
   - **Mixed Parity**: If there are both even and odd integers, the count of odd integers (`cnt`) must be even for the final result to be "YES". This is because each operation reduces the number of odd integers by 2, and the parity of the count of odd integers remains unchanged. If the count of odd integers is odd, it is impossible to reduce the count to 1, so the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Minimum N (2)**: For `N = 2`, if both integers are even, the program prints "YES". If both integers are odd, the program prints "YES". If one is even and one is odd, the program prints "NO".
   - **All Even or All Odd**: As mentioned, the program handles these cases correctly by checking the parity of the count of odd integers.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
