You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are N integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i.

Takahashi will repeatedly perform the following operation on these numbers:

* Select a pair of integers, A_i and A_j, that have the same parity (that is, both are even or both are odd) and erase them.
* Then, write a new integer on the blackboard that is equal to the sum of those integers, A_i+A_j.



Determine whether it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard.

Constraints

* 2 ≦ N ≦ 10^5
* 1 ≦ A_i ≦ 10^9
* A_i is an integer.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_1 A_2 … A_N


Output

If it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard, print `YES`. Otherwise, print `NO`.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

5
1 2 3 4 5


Output

NO
Program:
```
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    A = list(map(int, raw_input().split(' ')))
    cnt = 0
    for a in A:
        cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0
    print('YES' if cnt % 2 == 0 else 'NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program is designed to determine if it's possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of all integers on the blackboard remains invariant under the described operations. This is because:

- The sum of two even numbers is even.
- The sum of two odd numbers is even.
- The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.

Thus, the total parity of the sum of all integers on the blackboard will remain the same before and after any number of operations. For the final result to be a single integer, the sum of all integers must have the same parity as the final integer. Since the final integer can be either odd or even, the initial count of odd integers (`cnt`) must be even for the process to end with a single integer.

The program counts the number of odd integers in the list and checks if this count is even. If it is, the program prints `YES`, indicating that it is possible to end up with a single integer; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

This logic correctly handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `N` and a list `A` of `N` integers from the standard input. It then counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`. If the count of odd integers is even, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the following: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer \( A_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( A_i \) ≤ 10^9, and the output is either "YES" or "NO" based on the parity of the count of odd integers in `A`. Edge cases include when `N` is 2 (the minimum allowed value) and when all integers in `A` are even or all are odd.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
