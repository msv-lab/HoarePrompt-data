Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of all numbers on the blackboard remains unchanged through the operations. The program counts the number of odd numbers in the input list. If this count is even, it means the total sum of the numbers (considering their parities) can be combined into a single number, and thus the output is "YES". If the count is odd, it's impossible to end up with a single number, so the output is "NO". This logic holds for all potential cases within the given constraints.
