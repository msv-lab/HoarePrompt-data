Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `A`, which matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Counting Odd Integers**: The program counts the number of odd integers in the list `A`. This is done using the line `cnt += 1 if a & 1 == 1 else 0`. The expression `a & 1 == 1` checks if the integer `a` is odd, and if so, increments the counter `cnt`.

3. **Determining Feasibility**: The key insight for solving this problem is that the operation of combining two integers with the same parity (both even or both odd) results in a new integer with the same parity. Therefore, the parity of the final integer on the blackboard depends on the initial count of odd integers:
   - If the number of odd integers is even, the remaining integer can be even or odd, and it is possible to end up with a single integer.
   - If the number of odd integers is odd, it is impossible to end up with a single integer because the last two integers would have different parities, making it impossible to combine them.

4. **Output**: The program prints `YES` if the count of odd integers (`cnt`) is even, and `NO` otherwise. This correctly determines whether it is possible to have only one integer on the blackboard according to the problem's constraints.

Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as required.
