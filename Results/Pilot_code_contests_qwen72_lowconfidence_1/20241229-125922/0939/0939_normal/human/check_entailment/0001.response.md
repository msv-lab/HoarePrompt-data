Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program is designed to determine if it's possible to have only one integer on the blackboard after performing the specified operations. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of all integers on the blackboard remains invariant under the described operations. This is because:

- The sum of two even numbers is even.
- The sum of two odd numbers is even.
- The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd.

Thus, the total parity of the sum of all integers on the blackboard will remain the same before and after any number of operations. For the final result to be a single integer, the sum of all integers must have the same parity as the final integer. Since the final integer can be either odd or even, the initial count of odd integers (`cnt`) must be even for the process to end with a single integer.

The program counts the number of odd integers in the list and checks if this count is even. If it is, the program prints `YES`, indicating that it is possible to end up with a single integer; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

This logic correctly handles all edge cases and constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
