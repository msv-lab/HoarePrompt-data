The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with the condition `0 <= r <= n`. The function returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod`, where `fac` is a list of precomputed factorials, `finv` is a list of precomputed modular inverses of factorials, and `mod` is a constant used for modular arithmetic. The function assumes that the lists `fac` and `finv` are already defined and correctly populated with the appropriate values. If `n` is less than `r`, the function handles this edge case by returning `0`.
