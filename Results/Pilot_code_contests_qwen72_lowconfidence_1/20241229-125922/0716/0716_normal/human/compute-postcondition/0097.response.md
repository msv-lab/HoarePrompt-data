The function `func_1` is called with the argument `min(totscore - redscore, totscore)`. This means that the argument passed to `func_1` is the minimum value between `totscore - redscore` and `totscore`.

- `totscore` remains unchanged.
- `redscore` remains unchanged.
- The function `func_1` is called with the calculated argument, but since the function itself is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. However, the call to `func_1` does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `ar`, `adj`, `totscore`, or `redscore`.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the fact that `func_1` has been called with the argument `min(totscore - redscore, totscore)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 105\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist `adj[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) is sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is the maximum value of `curscore - besscore` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `func_1` has been called with the argument `min(totscore - redscore, totscore)`**.
