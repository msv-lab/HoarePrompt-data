The code snippet `curscore += abs(i - j)` updates the value of `curscore` by adding the absolute difference between `i` and `j` to its current value.

- `i` is 1 (initial state).
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.
- `curscore` was initially `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)` (initial state).

Therefore, the updated value of `curscore` is:

\[ \text{curscore} = \text{curscore} + \text{abs}(1 - j) \]

Given that `curscore` was initially `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`, the new value of `curscore` becomes:

\[ \text{curscore} = \text{abs}(1 - new_j) + \text{abs}(1 - j) + \text{abs}(1 - j) \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ \text{curscore} = \text{abs}(1 - new_j) + 2 \times \text{abs}(1 - j) \]

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + 2 * abs(1 - j)`, `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`**
