The code `besscore += abs(med - j)` updates the value of `besscore` by adding the absolute difference between `med` and `j` to its current value. 

Given:
- `n` is at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`
- `curscore` is `abs(2 - j)`
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`
- `besscore` is 0

Impact:
- `besscore` is updated to `abs(med - j)`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is `abs(2 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`**
