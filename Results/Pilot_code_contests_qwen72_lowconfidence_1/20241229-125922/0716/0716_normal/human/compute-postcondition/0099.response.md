Functionality: ** The function `func_29` processes a list `ar` of `m` integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. The function constructs an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`. It then calculates two scores: `totscore`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, and `redscore`, which is the maximum reduction in score achievable by replacing each element `i` in `ar` with the median of its adjacent elements in `adj[i]`. Finally, the function calls `func_1` with the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore`. The function does not return a value directly but affects the state by calling `func_1` with the computed result. **

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- **Empty List (`ar`)**: If `ar` is empty (which is not possible given the constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ 105), the function would still attempt to process it, leading to potential issues.
- **Single Element List (`ar`)**: If `ar` contains only one element, the adjacency list `adj` will remain empty, and both `totscore` and `redscore` will be zero. The function will call `func_1` with zero.
- **All Elements Equal**: If all elements in `ar` are the same, the adjacency list `adj` will remain empty, and `totscore` will be zero. The function will call `func_1` with zero.
- **Large Input Size**: Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), the function should handle large inputs efficiently. The sorting step in the calculation of `redscore` could be a bottleneck for very large lists.
- **Negative Values in `ar`**: The function assumes that all elements in `ar` are positive integers within the specified range. If this assumption is violated, the function may produce incorrect results or raise errors.
