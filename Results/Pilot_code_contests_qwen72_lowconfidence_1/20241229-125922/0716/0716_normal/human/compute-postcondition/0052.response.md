The given code snippet updates the value of `besscore` by adding the absolute difference between `med` and `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`
- `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`
- `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j)`

The code snippet:
```python
besscore += abs(med - j)
```

### Step-by-Step Impact Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j)`
   - `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `besscore += abs(med - j)` adds the value of `abs(med - j)` to `besscore`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`.

### Updated Values:
- `besscore` is now `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`

### Output State:
**`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`, `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`**.
