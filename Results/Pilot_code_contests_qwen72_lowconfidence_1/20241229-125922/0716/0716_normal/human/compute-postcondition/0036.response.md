To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the initial state:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `totscore` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(1, m):
    totscore += abs(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m - 1`.
- For each iteration, `totscore` is incremented by the absolute difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]`.

### Output State:
- If `m` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `totscore` remains 0.
- If `m` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `m - 1` times.
- After the loop finishes, `totscore` will be the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

### Final Output State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.**
