To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 1
- `i` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`
- `redscore` is 0
- `curscore` is `abs(1 - j)`
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]`
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`
- `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`

### Loop Statement:
```
for j in adj[i]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `adj[i]`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was set to the current element in `adj[i]`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the next iteration, `j` will be set to the next element in `adj[i]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: `j` should be updated to the next element in `adj[i]`.
- **`curscore`**: Since `curscore` is calculated based on the current value of `j`, it will be recalculated as `abs(1 - new_j)`.
- **`besscore`**: Similarly, `besscore` will be recalculated as `abs(med - new_j)`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains at least 1
- `i` remains 1
- `m` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)
- `ar` remains a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)
- `adj` remains a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)
- `adj[1]` remains sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element
- `totscore` remains the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`
- `redscore` remains 0
- `l` remains the length of `adj[i]`
- `med` remains `adj[i][l // 2]`
- `j` is updated to the next element in `adj[i]`
- `curscore` is updated to `abs(1 - new_j)`
- `besscore` is updated to `abs(med - new_j)`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j)`, `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j)`**
