To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in adj[i]:` will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `adj[i]` to iterate over.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
   - `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element.
   - `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - `redscore` is 0.
   - `l` is the length of `adj[i]`.
   - `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
   - `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.
   - `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`.
   - `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `adj[i]`, the next value of `j` should be the next element in `adj[i]`.
   - The length `l` of `adj[i]` remains the same.
   - The median `med` of `adj[i]` remains the same.
   - The current score `curscore` and the best score `besscore` are computed based on the current and next elements in `adj[i]`.

Given that `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be set to the next element in `adj[i]`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`, `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j) + abs(med - j)`**
