To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

### For Loop Statement
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `n` is at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`.
- `curscore` is the sum of `abs(1 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]`.
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.

### Analysis
The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `i` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to 2.
- `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

### Updated State
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- All other variables (`m`, `ar`, `adj`, `totscore`, `redscore`, `curscore`, `l`, `med`, `besscore`) remain unchanged.

### Final State
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is the sum of `abs(1 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.**
