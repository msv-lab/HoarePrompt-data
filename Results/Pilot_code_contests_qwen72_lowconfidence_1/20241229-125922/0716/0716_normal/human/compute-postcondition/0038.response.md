To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.
- The variable `i` will take values from 1 to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `n` is at least 1, as the loop will not execute if `n` is less than 1.
- The initial value of `i` should be 1, as the loop starts with `i = 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.

Thus, the state after adjustments is:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0**
