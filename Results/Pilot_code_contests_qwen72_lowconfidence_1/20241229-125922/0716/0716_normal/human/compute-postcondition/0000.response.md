The function `func_21()` is called, which returns two values. These values are assigned to `n` and `m`. Since the function's return values are not specified in the initial state, we assume they are new values that replace the current values of `n` and `m`. However, the constraints on `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) and the condition that `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n remain valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, and `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`**
