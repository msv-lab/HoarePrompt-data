To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`.
- `curscore` is 0.
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]`.
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in adj[i]:
    curscore += abs(i - j)
    besscore += abs(med - j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `j` in `adj[i]`.
   - For each `j`, `curscore` is incremented by `abs(i - j)`.
   - For each `j`, `besscore` is incremented by `abs(med - j)`.

2. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop finishes, `curscore` will be the sum of `abs(i - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.
   - After the loop finishes, `besscore` will be the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute at least once if `adj[i]` is not empty, i.e., `l > 0`.
   - If `adj[i]` is empty, `l` will be 0, and the loop will not execute, leaving `curscore` and `besscore` unchanged (both will remain 0).

### Final Output State:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`.
- `curscore` is the sum of `abs(2 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[2]`.
- `med` is `adj[2][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`.
