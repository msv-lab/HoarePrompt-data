The value of `totscore` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `ar[i]` and `ar[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `totscore` is incremented by `abs(ar[3] - ar[2])`.

The initial state specifies that `totscore` is calculated as `abs(ar[1] - ar[0]) + abs(ar[2] - ar[1])`. After executing the given code, `totscore` becomes `abs(ar[1] - ar[0]) + abs(ar[2] - ar[1]) + abs(ar[3] - ar[2])`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `ar`, `adj`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `totscore` is \( \text{abs}(ar[1] - ar[0]) + \text{abs}(ar[2] - ar[1]) + \text{abs}(ar[3] - ar[2]) \), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
