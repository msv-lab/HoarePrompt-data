The code snippet `curscore += abs(i - j)` updates the value of `curscore` by adding the absolute difference between `i` and `j` to its current value. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- `i` is 3 (as given in the initial state).
- `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the code snippet, implying that `j` must be a variable that is already defined and has a value.
- `curscore` initially holds the value `abs(3 - next_j)`.

The impact of the code is:
- `curscore` is updated to `curscore + abs(3 - j)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order, `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is `abs(3 - next_j) + abs(3 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - next_j)`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.**
