To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in adj[i]:` will execute if `adj[i]` is not empty. This means `adj[i]` must contain at least one element.

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
   - `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - `redscore` is 0.
   - `curscore` is 0.
   - `l` is the length of `adj[i]`.
   - `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
   - `besscore` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `adj[i]` must not be empty. Given that `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `adj[1]` is not empty.
   - Since `adj[1]` is already sorted in ascending order, we do not need to adjust this property.
   - The other variables (`totscore`, `redscore`, `curscore`, `l`, `med`, `besscore`) do not directly affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `adj[1]` is not empty.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `curscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is 0**
