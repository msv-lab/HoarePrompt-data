The value of `totscore` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `ar[i]` and `ar[i-1]`. Given `i` is 2, this means `totscore` is updated to `totscore + abs(ar[2] - ar[1])`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `ar`, `adj`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2, all remain valid.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`, `totscore` is `abs(ar[1] - ar[0]) + abs(ar[2] - ar[1])`, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
