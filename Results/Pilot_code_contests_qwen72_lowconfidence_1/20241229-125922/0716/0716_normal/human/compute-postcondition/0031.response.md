The code `totscore += abs(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` updates the value of `totscore` by adding the absolute difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]` in the list `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`
- `totscore` is 0
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1

The value of `totscore` is updated to `abs(ar[1] - ar[0])`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`
- `totscore` is `abs(ar[1] - ar[0])`
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`, `totscore` is `abs(ar[1] - ar[0])`, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
