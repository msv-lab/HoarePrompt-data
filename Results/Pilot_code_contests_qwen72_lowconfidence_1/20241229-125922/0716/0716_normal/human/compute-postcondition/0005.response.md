Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to the current value of `ar[i - 1]`.***
