To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `curscore` is the sum of `abs(2 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[2]`.
- `med` is `adj[2][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`.
- `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` is at least 2.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes 3.
- Ensure `n` is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is the sum of `abs(2 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`, `l` is the length of `adj[2]`, `med` is `adj[2][l // 2]`, `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)`**
