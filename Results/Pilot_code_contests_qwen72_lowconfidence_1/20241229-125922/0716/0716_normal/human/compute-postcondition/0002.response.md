The code initializes a list of empty lists named `adj`, with the length of this list being `n + 1`. This means that `adj` now contains `n + 1` sublists, each initially empty. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `ar`) remain unchanged, as they were after being updated by `func_21()` and `func_19()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.**
