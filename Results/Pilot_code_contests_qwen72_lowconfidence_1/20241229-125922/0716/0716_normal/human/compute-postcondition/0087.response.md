The given code snippet updates the value of `besscore` by adding the absolute difference between `med` and `j` to it. Let's analyze the impact step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
   - `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - `curscore` is `abs(3 - j)`.
   - `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
   - `besscore` is 0.
   - `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

2. **Code Impact:**
   - The line `besscore += abs(med - j)` adds the absolute difference between `med` and `j` to `besscore`.

3. **Updated Values:**
   - `besscore` is updated to `abs(med - j)`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
   - `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - `curscore` is `abs(3 - j)`.
   - `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
   - `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`.
   - `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is `abs(3 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0**.
