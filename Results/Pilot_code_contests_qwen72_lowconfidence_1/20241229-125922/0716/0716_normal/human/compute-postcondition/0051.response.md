The value of `curscore` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `i` and `j`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`

The specific value of `j` is not provided, so we represent it as `j`.

Therefore, `curscore` is updated from its previous value (which was `abs(1 - new_j)`) to `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`.

The output state is:
**`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one element, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`, `curscore` is `abs(1 - new_j) + abs(1 - j)`, `besscore` is `abs(med - new_j)`**.
