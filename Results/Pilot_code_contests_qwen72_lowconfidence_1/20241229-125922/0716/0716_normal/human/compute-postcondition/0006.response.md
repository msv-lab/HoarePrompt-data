The code snippet `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i - 1])` modifies the `adj` list by appending the value `ar[i - 1]` to the list located at the index `ar[i]` in `adj`.

- `adj[ar[i]]` is the list in `adj` at the index `ar[i]`.
- `ar[i - 1]` is the value being appended to this list.

Since `ar[i]` and `ar[i - 1]` are distinct (as per the precondition), this operation will add `ar[i - 1]` to the list at `adj[ar[i]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to the current value of `ar[i - 1]`. `adj[ar[i]]` now contains the value `ar[i - 1]`.**
