The given code snippet `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])` appends the value `ar[i + 1]` to the list located at index `ar[i]` in the `adj` list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- If `i - 1 >= 0` and `ar[1]` is not equal to `ar[0]`, `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]` and `ar[0]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The current value of `i` is 1.
2. The code `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])` will append `ar[2]` to the list `adj[ar[1]]`.

Since `i` is 1, the condition `i - 1 >= 0` is true. We also know that `ar[1]` is not equal to `ar[0]` from the initial state. Therefore, `adj[ar[1]]` already contains `ar[2]` and `ar[0]`.

After executing the code:
- `adj[ar[1]]` will now contain `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]` again (since `ar[i + 1]` is `ar[2]`).

Thus, the output state is:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]`.**
