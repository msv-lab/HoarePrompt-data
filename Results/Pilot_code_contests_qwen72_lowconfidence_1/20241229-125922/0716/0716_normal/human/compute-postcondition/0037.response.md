The code initializes `redscore` to 0. This does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged except for the new value of `redscore`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0**.
