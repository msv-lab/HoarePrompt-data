The code `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])` appends the value `ar[i + 1]` to the list `adj[ar[i]]`.

- `adj[ar[i]]` is the list in `adj` indexed by `ar[i]`.
- `ar[i + 1]` is the value being appended to this list.

Since `i` is 0 and `i + 1` is less than `m`, the code will execute without errors. The value of `ar[1]` will be appended to the list `adj[ar[0]]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. `adj[ar[0]]` now contains the value `ar[1]`. The current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to the value of `ar[i + 1]`.**
