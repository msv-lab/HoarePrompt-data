The value of `ar` is now the list returned by `func_19()`. Since `n` and `m` have already been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, these values remain unchanged. The list `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`**
