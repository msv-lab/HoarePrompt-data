Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `ar[i] != ar[i + 1]`, `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.***
