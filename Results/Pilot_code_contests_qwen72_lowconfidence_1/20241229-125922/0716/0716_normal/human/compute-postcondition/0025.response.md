The code `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])` appends the value of `ar[i + 1]` to the list `adj[ar[i]]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- If `i - 1 >= 0` and `ar[2] != ar[1]`, `adj[ar[2]]` now includes `ar[1]`. Otherwise, `adj[ar[2]]` remains unchanged.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 2, so `ar[i]` is `ar[2]`.
2. `i + 1` is 3, so `ar[i + 1]` is `ar[3]`.
3. The code `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])` appends `ar[3]` to the list `adj[ar[2]]`.

Since `i - 1 >= 0` and `ar[2] != ar[1]` (as per the initial state), `adj[ar[2]]` already includes `ar[1]`. After executing the code, `adj[ar[2]]` will also include `ar[3]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.
- `adj[ar[2]]` now includes both `ar[1]` and `ar[3]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `adj[ar[2]]` now includes both `ar[1]` and `ar[3]`.**
