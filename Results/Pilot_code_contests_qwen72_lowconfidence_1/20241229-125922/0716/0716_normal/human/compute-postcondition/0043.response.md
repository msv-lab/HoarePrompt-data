The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the fact that the control flow is impacted.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `curscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`. The current value of `l` is 0, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
