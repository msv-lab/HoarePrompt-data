To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `curscore` is `abs(3 - next_j) + abs(3 - j)`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
- `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is `abs(med - next_j) + abs(med - j)`.
- `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in adj[i]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. The loop iterates over the elements in `adj[i]`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value in `adj[i]`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `adj[i]` that hasn't been processed yet.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` needs to be the next element in `adj[i]`.
- Since `i` is 3, we need to ensure that `adj[3]` has at least one more element to process.

### Conclusion:
Given that `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, and assuming the loop has not finished processing all elements in `adj[3]`, the next state should reflect the next value of `j` in `adj[3]`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order, `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is `abs(3 - next_j) + abs(3 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - next_j) + abs(med - j)`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0, `j` is the next element in `adj[3]`**
