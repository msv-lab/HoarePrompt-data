To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `totscore` is calculated as \( \text{abs}(ar[1] - ar[0]) + \text{abs}(ar[2] - ar[1]) \).
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.

### Loop Condition:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `totscore` is \( \text{abs}(ar[1] - ar[0]) + \text{abs}(ar[2] - ar[1]) \).

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `i` (which will be 3) is less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `i` is 3.
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `totscore` remains the same as it is not modified by the loop increment.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `totscore` is \( \text{abs}(ar[1] - ar[0]) + \text{abs}(ar[2] - ar[1]) \), `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**.
