The code snippet updates the value of `besscore` by adding the absolute difference between `med` and `j` to it. Let's break down the changes:

- `besscore` is updated to `besscore + abs(med - j)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the updated state will be:

- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`.
- `curscore` is `3 * abs(2 - j)`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0.
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is now `besscore + abs(med - j)`.
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.
