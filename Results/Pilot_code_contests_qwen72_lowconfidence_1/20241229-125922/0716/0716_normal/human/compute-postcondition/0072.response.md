To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`.
- `curscore` is `abs(2 - j) + abs(2 - j)`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0.
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is `besscore + abs(med - j)`.
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for j in adj[i]:` will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `adj[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the current element in `adj[i]`.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the next element in `adj[i]`.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop will terminate when all elements in `adj[i]` have been processed.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `ar`, `adj`, `totscore`, `redscore`, `curscore`, `l`, `med`, `besscore`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is `abs(2 - j) + abs(2 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `besscore + abs(med - j)`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`.**
