To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given state and the loop conditions:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range.
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers, each within the range [1, n].
   - `n` and `m` have been updated by `func_21()`.
   - `ar` has been set to the list returned by `func_19()`.
   - `adj` is initialized as a list of `n + 1` empty lists.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### Final Adjusted State:

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
