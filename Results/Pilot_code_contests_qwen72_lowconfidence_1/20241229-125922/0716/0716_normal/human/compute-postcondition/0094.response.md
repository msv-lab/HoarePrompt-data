To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the changes it makes to the variables involved. Let's break down the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `curscore` is 0.
- `l` is the length of `adj[3]`.
- `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is 0.
- `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in adj[i]:
    curscore += abs(i - j)
    besscore += abs(med - j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `j` in `adj[i]`. Since `i` is 3, the loop iterates over `adj[3]`.
2. **Variable Updates**:
   - `curscore` is incremented by `abs(i - j)` for each `j` in `adj[3]`.
   - `besscore` is incremented by `abs(med - j)` for each `j` in `adj[3]`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- **`curscore`**: After the loop finishes, `curscore` will be the sum of `abs(3 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[3]`.
- **`besscore`**: After the loop finishes, `besscore` will be the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[3]`.
- **`redscore`**: The value of `redscore` is updated after the loop based on the condition `if l is 0`. However, since `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and the loop executes, `l` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `redscore` will not be updated by this condition.

### Output State:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `curscore` is the sum of `abs(3 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[3]`.
- `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
- `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[3]`.
- `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0, but since `l` is greater than 0, `redscore` remains unchanged.
