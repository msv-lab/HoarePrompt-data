The code snippet `curscore += abs(i - j)` modifies the value of `curscore` by adding the absolute difference between `i` and `j` to its current value. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `i` is 2 (from the initial state).
- `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means it must be defined elsewhere in the code. However, for the purpose of this simulation, we need to assume a value for `j`. Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `abs(i - j)`. Instead, we will represent the updated `curscore` in terms of `j`.

Given that `curscore` is initially 0, the new value of `curscore` will be `abs(2 - j)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is `abs(2 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is 0**
