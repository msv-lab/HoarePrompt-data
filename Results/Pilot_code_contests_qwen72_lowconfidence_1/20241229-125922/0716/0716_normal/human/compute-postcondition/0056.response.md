To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change over the course of the loop's execution and what their final values will be after all iterations have completed. Let's break down the loop and its effects step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is 0.
- `curscore` is 0.
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]`.
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the elements in `adj[i]`:
```python
for j in adj[i]:
    curscore += abs(i - j)
    besscore += abs(med - j)
```

### Output State After All Iterations:
- `n` remains at least 1.
- `i` remains 1.
- `m` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` remains a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` remains a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` remains sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` remains the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` remains 0 (unchanged by the loop).
- `curscore` will be the sum of `abs(1 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.
- `l` remains the length of `adj[i]`.
- `med` remains `adj[i][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` will be the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.

### Summary:
- If `adj[i]` is empty, `curscore` and `besscore` will remain 0.
- If `adj[i]` is not empty, `curscore` will be the sum of the absolute differences between 1 and each element in `adj[i]`, and `besscore` will be the sum of the absolute differences between `med` and each element in `adj[i]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is 0, `curscore` is the sum of `abs(1 - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]`, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.**
