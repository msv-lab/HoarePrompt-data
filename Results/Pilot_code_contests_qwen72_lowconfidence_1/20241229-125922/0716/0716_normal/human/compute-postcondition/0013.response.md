Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[0]` is not equal to `ar[1]`, `adj[ar[0]]` now contains the value `ar[1]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.***
