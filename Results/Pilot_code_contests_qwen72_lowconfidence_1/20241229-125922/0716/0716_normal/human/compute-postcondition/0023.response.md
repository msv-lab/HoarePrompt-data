Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `ar[2] != ar[1]`, `adj[ar[2]]` now includes `ar[1]`. Otherwise, `adj[ar[2]]` remains unchanged.***
