The code snippet initializes the variable `totscore` to 0. This initialization does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `ar`, or `adj`. 

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state, except for the new value of `totscore`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`, `totscore` is 0**.
