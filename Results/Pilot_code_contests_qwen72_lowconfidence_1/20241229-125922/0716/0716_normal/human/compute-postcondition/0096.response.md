To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the final state of each variable.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is 0.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each `i`:
1. `adj[i]` is sorted.
2. `curscore` is calculated as the sum of `abs(i - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`.
3. `besscore` is calculated as the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[i]`, where `med` is the median of `adj[i]`.
4. `redscore` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `curscore - besscore`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- **`n`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
- **`m`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
- **`ar`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
- **`adj`**: Each sublist `adj[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) is sorted in ascending order.
- **`totscore`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
- **`redscore`**: After all iterations, `redscore` will be the maximum value of `curscore - besscore` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

### Summary:
After the loop finishes executing, the final state of the variables is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 105\).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist `adj[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) is sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `redscore` is the maximum value of `curscore - besscore` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 105\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each sublist `adj[i]` for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) is sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is the maximum value of `curscore - besscore` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.**
