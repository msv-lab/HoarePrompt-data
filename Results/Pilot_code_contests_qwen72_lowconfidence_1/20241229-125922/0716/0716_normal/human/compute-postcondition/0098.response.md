The function `func_29` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, and a list `ar`. The parameters `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. The list `ar` contains `m` integers, where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.

The function returns a result based on the processing of the list `ar` within the given constraints. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information, so the exact return value cannot be determined from the given context.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) and a list `ar` of `m` integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). The function processes the list `ar` and returns a result based on the elements of the list and the given constraints.**
