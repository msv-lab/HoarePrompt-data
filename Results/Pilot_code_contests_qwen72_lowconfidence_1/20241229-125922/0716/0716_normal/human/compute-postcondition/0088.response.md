To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the state at the start of the next iteration based on the given for loop statement:

```python
for j in adj[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `adj[i]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `adj[i]` must have at least one element.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
   - `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
   - `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order.
   - `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - `curscore` is `abs(3 - j)`.
   - `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`.
   - `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`.
   - `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is 3 and the loop is iterating over `adj[3]`, the next iteration will use the next element in `adj[3]`.
   - The variable `j` will be set to the next element in `adj[3]`.

### Adjusted State:

- `n` remains at least 3.
- `i` remains 3.
- `m` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\).
- `ar` remains a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
- `adj` remains a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\).
- `adj[1]` remains sorted in ascending order.
- `adj[3]` remains sorted in ascending order.
- `totscore` remains the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- `curscore` will be updated to `abs(3 - next_j)`, where `next_j` is the next element in `adj[3]`.
- `l` remains the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0.
- `med` remains `adj[3][l // 2]`.
- `besscore` will be updated to `abs(med - next_j)`.
- `redscore` will be updated to `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is sorted in ascending order, `adj[3]` is sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is `abs(3 - next_j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - next_j)`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0.**
