To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to run. The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the condition `i < m`. Additionally, the state of the `adj` list may change based on the values in `ar`.

Given the current state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[0]` is not equal to `ar[1]`, `adj[ar[0]]` now contains the value `ar[1]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
2. `m` must still be greater than `i`, so `m` must be greater than 1.
3. The condition `i + 1 < m` (which translates to `1 + 1 < m` or `2 < m`) must hold true.
4. The value of `ar[1]` must be checked against `ar[2]` to determine if `adj` should be updated.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- If `2 < m` and `ar[1]` is not equal to `ar[2]`, then `adj[ar[1]]` will contain the value `ar[2]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[1]` is not equal to `ar[2]`, `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the value `ar[2]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.**
