To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop iterates over the elements in `adj[i]`, so for the loop to execute, `adj[i]` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 3
- `i` is 3
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`
- `curscore` is 0
- `l` is the length of `adj[3]`
- `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`
- `besscore` is 0
- `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0

For the loop to execute:
- `adj[i]` must have at least one element. Since `i` is 3, `adj[3]` must have at least one element.
- Therefore, `l` (the length of `adj[3]`) must be greater than 0.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `adj[3]` is not empty. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[3]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[3][l // 2]`, `besscore` is 0, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)` if `l` is 0**
