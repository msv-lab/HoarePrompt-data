To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will continue to run. The loop iterates over the elements in `adj[i]`, so the loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `adj[i]` to process.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)
- `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order
- `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`
- `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`
- `curscore` is `abs(2 - j)`
- `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0
- `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`
- `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be an element in `adj[i]` that has not yet been processed.
- The loop will continue to the next element in `adj[i]`.

Since `j` is the current element being processed, it will be updated to the next element in `adj[i]` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` should be set to the next element in `adj[i]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `ar`, `adj`, `totscore`, `redscore`, `curscore`, `l`, `med`, `besscore`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body (as per the given information).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is `abs(2 - j)`, `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is `abs(med - j)`, `j` is the next element in `adj[i]`**
