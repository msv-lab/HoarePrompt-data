To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop `for j in adj[i]:` will run. The loop will execute if `adj[i]` is not empty. Let's break down the given state and identify the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n` is at least 2**: This condition ensures that there are at least two elements in the range, which is necessary for the adjacency list to make sense.
2. **`i` is 2**: This is the starting index for the loop, which is fine as long as `adj[2]` is not empty.
3. **`m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\)**: This ensures that the list `ar` has a valid number of elements.
4. **`ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\)**: This ensures that the elements in `ar` are within the valid range.
5. **`adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\)**: This describes the structure of the adjacency list.
6. **`adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order**: This ensures that the first element's adjacency list is sorted.
7. **`adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order**: This ensures that the current element's adjacency list is sorted.
8. **`totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`**: This is a computed value based on `ar`.
9. **`redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`**: This is a computed value based on `curscore` and `besscore`.
10. **`curscore` is 0**: This is the initial score.
11. **`l` is the length of `adj[i]`**: This is the length of the current adjacency list.
12. **`med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`**: This is the median of the current adjacency list.
13. **`besscore` is 0**: This is the best score.

For the loop to execute, `adj[i]` must not be empty. Therefore, `l` (the length of `adj[i]`) must be greater than 0. 

Given that `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `adj[2]` is not empty. If `l` is 0, the loop will not execute, so we need to adjust the state to ensure `l` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `redscore` is `max(0, curscore - besscore)`, `curscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[i]` and must be greater than 0, `med` is `adj[i][l // 2]`, `besscore` is 0**.
