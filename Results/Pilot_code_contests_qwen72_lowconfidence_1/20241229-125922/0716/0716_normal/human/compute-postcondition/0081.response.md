The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables; it only causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there's no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would have no effect on the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to any variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 105\), `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[a_i]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to \(a_i\) and are not equal to \(a_i\), `adj[1]` is now sorted in ascending order, `adj[i]` is now sorted in ascending order, `totscore` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, `curscore` is 0, `l` is the length of `adj[3]`, `med` is `adj[2][l // 2]`, `besscore` is the sum of `abs(med - j)` for all `j` in `adj[2]`, `redscore` is `max(redscore, curscore - besscore)`**
