The given code snippet appends the value of `ar[i - 1]` to the list `adj[ar[i]]`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers, each between 1 and `n`.
- `n` and `m` have been updated by `func_21()`, and `ar` is set by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 1.
- The condition `i + 1 < m` and `ar[1] != ar[2]` has already been checked and found true, meaning `adj[ar[1]]` contains `ar[2]`.

Given these conditions, the code `adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i - 1])` will append `ar[0]` to the list `adj[ar[1]]`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1. `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]` and `ar[0]`.**
