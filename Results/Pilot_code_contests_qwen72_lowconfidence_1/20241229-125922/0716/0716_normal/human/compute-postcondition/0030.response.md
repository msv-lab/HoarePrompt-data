To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`.
- `totscore` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, m)` will execute if `m` is greater than 1. This is because `range(1, m)` generates a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` will start at 1.
3. **Other Variables**: The values of `n`, `ar`, `adj`, and `totscore` do not directly affect the loop condition, but they are part of the initial state.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` should be 1. The other variables (`n`, `ar`, `adj`, and `totscore`) remain as given.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where `adj[ai]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ai` and are not equal to `ai`, `totscore` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
