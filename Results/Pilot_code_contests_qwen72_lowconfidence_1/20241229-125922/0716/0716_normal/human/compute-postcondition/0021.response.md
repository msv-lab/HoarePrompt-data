To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105.
- `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
- `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`.
- `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists.
- `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1.
- If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[i] != ar[i + 1]`, `adj[ar[1]]` now contains the values `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]`. Otherwise, `adj` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop `for i in range(m):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

### Analysis:
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `adj[ar[1]]` contains `ar[2]`, `ar[0]`, and `ar[2]` if `i + 1 < m` and `ar[i] != ar[i + 1]`.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The condition `i < m` must still hold true, so `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Additional Conditions**:
   - If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[i] != ar[i + 1]`, then `adj[ar[2]]` will be modified in the next iteration. However, this is not a state that needs to be adjusted before the loop starts; it is a condition that will be checked during the loop execution.

### Final State:
- `i` is 2.
- `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, `ar` is a list of `m` integers where each element `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n, `n` and `m` have been updated to the values returned by `func_21()`, `ar` is the list returned by `func_19()`, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists, `i` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `i + 1 < m` and `ar[i] != ar[i + 1]`, `adj[ar[2]]` will be modified in the next iteration.**
