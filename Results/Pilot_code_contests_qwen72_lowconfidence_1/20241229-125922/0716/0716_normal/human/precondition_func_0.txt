args is a tuple containing any number of items to be printed, and kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'sep' is a string used to separate the items to be printed, 'file' is the stream to which the items will be written (default is sys.stdout), 'end' is the string appended after the last item, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.
