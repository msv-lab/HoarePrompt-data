The provided function `func_12` does not contain any parameters or use any variables related to the problem statement. It simply calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as an argument. Since there are no variables in the function signature related to the problem, it is not possible to derive a precondition based on the function signature alone.

However, if you need a precondition based on the problem description and typical requirements for solving the problem, here is a general precondition that could be associated with a function designed to solve this problem:

**n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, and a is a list of m integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.**

This precondition reflects the constraints given in the problem description and would typically apply to a function that processes the input for this problem. However, it does not directly relate to the provided `func_12` function.
