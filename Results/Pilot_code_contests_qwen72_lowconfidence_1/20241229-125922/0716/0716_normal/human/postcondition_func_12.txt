The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as an argument. The function does not return any value explicitly. After the function `func_12` concludes, the state of the program is unchanged except for the side effects caused by the call to `func_1('Yes')`. If `func_1` modifies any global variables or has other side effects, those changes will persist. However, since the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can only conclude that `func_12` triggers `func_1` with the string 'Yes'.
