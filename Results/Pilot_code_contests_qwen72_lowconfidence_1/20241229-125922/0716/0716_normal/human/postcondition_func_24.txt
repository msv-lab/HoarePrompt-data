The function `func_24` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_18` with a newline character (`'\n'`) as an argument. After the function `func_24` completes its execution, the state of the program is unchanged except for the side effects that `func_18` might produce when called with `'\n'`. Since the return value of `func_18` is not captured or used, the overall effect of `func_24` is solely dependent on the behavior of `func_18` with the given argument.
