The function `func_4` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It returns `0` if `x` is divisible by `p` (i.e., `x % p == 0`). Otherwise, it returns `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. This means the function computes `x^y % p`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`, `y` is 0, and the function returns the result of the modular exponentiation.
