### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
The problem requires us to minimize the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn in her notebook by merging two pages at most once. The input consists of:
- `n`: the number of pages in the notebook.
- `m`: the number of pieces of information.
- `ar`: a list of `m` integers representing the pages where the information is located.

The goal is to find the minimum number of pages that need to be turned after optionally merging two pages.

#### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - `n, m = func_21()`: Reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - `ar = func_19()`: Reads a list of `m` integers.

2. **Building Adjacency List:**
   - `adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]`: Initializes an adjacency list to store the adjacent pages for each page.
   - For each page in `ar`, it adds the previous and next pages to the adjacency list if they are different.

3. **Calculating Total Score:**
   - `totscore = 0`: Initializes the total score.
   - `for i in range(1, m): totscore += abs(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])`: Calculates the total number of pages turned without any merges.

4. **Finding Maximum Reduction:**
   - `redscore = 0`: Initializes the reduction score.
   - For each page `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - Sorts the adjacency list `adj[i]`.
     - Calculates the current score (`curscore`) and the best score (`besscore`) using the median of the adjacency list.
     - Updates `redscore` to the maximum reduction possible.

5. **Output:**
   - `func_1(min(totscore - redscore, totscore))`: Prints the minimum of the total score and the reduced score.

#### Verification
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary data structures.
  
- **Correctness of Total Score Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of pages turned without any merges by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

- **Correctness of Reduction Calculation:**
  - The program attempts to find the best merge by calculating the reduction in the number of pages turned. It does this by considering the median of the adjacency list, which is a reasonable approach to minimize the sum of absolute differences.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the minimum number of pages turned after considering the best possible merge.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the number of pages turned in Ryouko's notebook by optionally merging two pages. It handles the input, calculates the total score, finds the best reduction, and outputs the correct result.

### Final Verdict
Correctness: **True**

The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly solves the problem for all valid inputs.
