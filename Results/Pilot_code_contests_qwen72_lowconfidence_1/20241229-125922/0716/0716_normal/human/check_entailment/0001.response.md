Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the merging of pages to minimize the number of page turns. The logic in the program attempts to calculate the reduction in the number of pages that need to be turned by considering the median of the adjacency list for each page. However, this approach does not always lead to the optimal solution.

A specific case where the program fails is:
- Input: `4 6` followed by `1 2 3 4 3 2`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: The program might output a different value because it does not correctly identify the optimal merge operation.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the reduction in the number of page turns. It uses the median of the adjacency list to estimate the reduction, but this does not always yield the correct result. A more accurate approach would involve directly calculating the total number of page turns for each possible merge operation and selecting the one that minimizes the total.

For example, in the given input, the optimal solution is to merge page 4 to page 3, which results in the sequence `{1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2}` and a total of 3 page turns. However, the program's current logic may not correctly identify this optimal merge.
