Final: **True**

Reasoning:

The original assessment stated that the program is correct, and the provided annotated version of the code supports this conclusion. Let's break down the key components and their correctness:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_21()` reads the first line of input, which contains `n` and `m`.
   - The function `func_19()` reads the second line of input, which contains the list `ar` of `m` integers.
   - These functions are correctly implemented and handle the input as expected.

2. **Adjacency List Construction:**
   - The program constructs an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the list `ar` and checking the previous and next elements.

3. **Initial Total Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial total score `totscore` as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the list `ar` and summing the absolute differences.

4. **Reduction Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the reduction score `redscore` by considering each page `i` and its adjacent pages.
   - For each page `i`, it sorts the adjacent pages, finds the median, and calculates the current score and the best score.
   - The reduction score is the maximum value of `curscore - besscore` for all pages `i`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the adjacency list and performing the necessary calculations.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program outputs the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore` using the function `func_1`.
   - This is the correct final output as per the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms that each step of the program is implemented correctly and follows the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly reads the input, constructs the adjacency list, calculates the initial and reduction scores, and outputs the correct result. There are no logical errors or issues in the provided code that would affect its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct, and the original assessment is maintained.
