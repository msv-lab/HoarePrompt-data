Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_29` correctly implements the logic to minimize the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn. Let's break down the function step by step to ensure it follows the problem description:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   n, m = func_21()
   ar = func_19()
   ```
   - This reads the number of pages `n` and the number of pieces of information `m`.
   - It then reads the list `ar` of `m` integers, each representing a page number.

2. **Building Adjacency List:**
   ```python
   adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
   for i in range(m):
       if i - 1 >= 0:
           if ar[i] != ar[i - 1]:
               adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i - 1])
       if i + 1 < m:
           if ar[i] != ar[i + 1]:
               adj[ar[i]].append(ar[i + 1])
   ```
   - This creates an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[page]` contains the pages adjacent to `page` in the sequence `ar`.

3. **Calculating Total Score:**
   ```python
   totscore = 0
   for i in range(1, m):
       totscore += abs(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])
   ```
   - This calculates the total number of pages Ryouko needs to turn without any merges.

4. **Finding Maximum Reduction in Score:**
   ```python
   redscore = 0
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       adj[i].sort()
       curscore = 0
       l = len(adj[i])
       if l == 0:
           continue
       med = adj[i][l // 2]
       besscore = 0
       for j in adj[i]:
           curscore += abs(i - j)
           besscore += abs(med - j)
       redscore = max(redscore, curscore - besscore)
   ```
   - For each page `i`, it sorts the adjacent pages and finds the median.
   - It calculates the current score `curscore` (total distance from `i` to its adjacent pages).
   - It calculates the best score `besscore` (total distance from the median to its adjacent pages).
   - It updates `redscore` to the maximum reduction in score.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   ```python
   func_1(min(totscore - redscore, totscore))
   ```
   - It prints the minimum of the total score and the reduced score.

### Verification:

- **Input Handling:** The function correctly reads the input and processes it as described in the problem.
- **Adjacency List Construction:** The adjacency list is built correctly, capturing all adjacent pages.
- **Total Score Calculation:** The total score is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
- **Reduction Calculation:** The reduction in score is calculated by finding the median of the adjacent pages and computing the difference in distances.
- **Result Printing:** The function prints the minimum of the total score and the reduced score, which is the required output.

### Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `4 6\n1 2 3 4 3 2`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Actual Output: `3`
  - Explanation: Merging page 4 to page 3 reduces the total score from 6 to 3.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `10 5\n9 4 3 8 8`
  - Expected Output: `6`
  - Actual Output: `6`
  - Explanation: Merging page 9 to page 4 reduces the total score from 11 to 6.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_29` correctly implements the logic to minimize the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
