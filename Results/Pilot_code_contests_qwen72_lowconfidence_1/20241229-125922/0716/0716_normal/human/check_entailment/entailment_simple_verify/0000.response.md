Final: **True**

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function `func_21()` reads and parses the input for `n` and `m` correctly.
   - The function `func_19()` reads and parses the list of integers `ar` correctly.

2. **Adjacency List Construction:**
   - The adjacency list `adj` is constructed correctly by iterating through the list `ar` and adding connections between adjacent pages that are not the same. This ensures that `adj[ar[i]]` contains the indices of the elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `ar[i]` and are not equal to `ar[i]`.

3. **Initial Total Score Calculation:**
   - The initial total score `totscore` is calculated correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

4. **Reduction Score Calculation:**
   - The reduction score `redscore` is calculated by considering the potential reduction in the total score if each page is merged with its adjacent pages. The algorithm sorts the adjacency list for each page, finds the median, and calculates the current score (`curscore`) and the best score (`besscore`) after merging. The maximum reduction in score is tracked using `redscore`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is the minimum of the initial total score and the total score minus the maximum reduction score. This ensures that the program outputs the minimum number of pages Ryouko needs to turn.

### Key Points from Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads and processes the input.
- The adjacency list construction and initial score calculation are consistent with the problem description.
- The reduction score calculation is logically sound and correctly implemented.
- The final output is correctly computed and printed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each step, confirming that the program meets the problem requirements and handles all necessary cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
