Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program reads the input, constructs an adjacency list representing the transitions between pages, calculates the initial total score (the sum of absolute differences between consecutive pages), and then tries to optimize this score by merging pages. It does this by calculating the reduction in the total score that can be achieved by merging each page with its adjacent pages and selecting the maximum possible reduction. Finally, it prints the minimum number of pages that Ryouko needs to turn.

The logic for merging pages and calculating the potential reduction in the total score is sound. The program handles edge cases, such as when the number of pages or the number of pieces of information is small, and it correctly updates the adjacency list and calculates the scores. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program seems to cover all necessary cases and operates correctly for all inputs I can think of.
