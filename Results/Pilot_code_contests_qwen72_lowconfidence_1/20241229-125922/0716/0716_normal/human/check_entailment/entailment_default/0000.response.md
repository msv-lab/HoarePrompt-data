### Analysis of the Program

The problem description requires us to minimize the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn in her notebook by merging two pages at most once. The provided function `func_29` is supposed to achieve this.

Let's break down the function and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads a list `ar` of `m` integers.

2. **Adjacency List Construction:**
   - An adjacency list `adj` is constructed where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`.

3. **Initial Score Calculation:**
   - `totscore` is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

4. **Reduction Score Calculation:**
   - For each page `i` from 1 to `n`, the function calculates the score reduction if page `i` is merged with the median of its adjacent elements.
   - `curscore` is the current score if page `i` is merged with each of its adjacent elements.
   - `besscore` is the score if page `i` is merged with the median of its adjacent elements.
   - `redscore` is the maximum reduction in score.

5. **Output:**
   - The function outputs the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore`.

### Verification

- **Input Handling:**
  - The function correctly reads the input and constructs the adjacency list.
  - The input constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) are respected.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The initial score `totscore` is calculated correctly as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

- **Reduction Score Calculation:**
  - The function correctly identifies the adjacent elements and calculates the score reduction if a page is merged with the median of its adjacent elements.
  - The median calculation is done correctly by sorting the adjacent elements and selecting the middle element.

- **Output:**
  - The function outputs the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore`, which is the required output.

### Edge Cases

- **Single Page or Single Element:**
  - If `n` or `m` is 1, the function correctly handles this by not performing any merges and outputting the initial score.

- **All Elements Are the Same:**
  - If all elements in `ar` are the same, the function correctly calculates `totscore` as 0 and outputs 0.

- **Large Input:**
  - The function should handle large inputs (up to 105) efficiently, as it uses adjacency lists and sorts only the adjacent elements, which are typically much smaller than `n`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_29` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
