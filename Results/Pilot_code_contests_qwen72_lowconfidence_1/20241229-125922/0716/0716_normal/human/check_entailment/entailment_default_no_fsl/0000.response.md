Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The function `func_29` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function is correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads `n` and `m` from the input using `func_21()`, which converts the input to integers.
   - It then reads the list `ar` of `m` integers using `func_19()`.

2. **Adjacency List Construction**:
   - The function constructs an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`. This is done by iterating through the list `ar` and adding the previous and next elements to the adjacency list if they are different from the current element.

3. **Total Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `totscore`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.

4. **Reduction Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `redscore`, which is the maximum reduction in score achievable by replacing each element `i` in `ar` with the median of its adjacent elements in `adj[i]`.
   - For each element `i` in `ar`, it sorts the adjacency list `adj[i]` and finds the median.
   - It then calculates the current score and the best possible score by replacing the element with the median.
   - The reduction score is updated to the maximum reduction found.

5. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore` using `func_1`.

The function handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- It correctly handles the case where `ar` is a list of identical elements, resulting in `totscore` being 0.
- It correctly handles the case where `ar` is a list of unique elements, ensuring that the adjacency list is constructed correctly.
- It correctly handles the case where `ar` has repeated elements, ensuring that the adjacency list only includes unique adjacent elements.
- The function correctly calculates the median and the reduction score, ensuring that the final output is the minimum number of pages Ryouko needs to turn.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation, the function `func_29` is correct for every potential case.
