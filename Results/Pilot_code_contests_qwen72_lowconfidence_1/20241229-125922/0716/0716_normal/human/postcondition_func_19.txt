The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. If `func_17` returns a string that cannot be split or contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` may be raised during the conversion process. Additionally, if `func_17` returns an empty string, the function will return an empty list.
