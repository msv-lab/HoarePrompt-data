#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple containing any number of items to be printed, and kwargs is a dictionary that may contain the keys 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush' with corresponding values. 'sep' is a string used to separate the items to be printed, 'file' is the stream to which the items will be written (default is sys.stdout), 'end' is the string appended after the last item, and 'flush' is a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream.

If `kwargs` contained the key 'flush' with the value `True`, the buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the items in `args` to a specified output stream (default is `sys.stdout`), using the following formatting options from `kwargs`: `sep` (separator between items, default is a space), `end` (string appended after the last item, default is a newline), and `flush` (a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, default is `False`). After the function executes, the items in `args` are concatenated into the specified stream, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer of the stream is flushed. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, where nothing is printed except the `end` string, and handling of non-string values in `args` which are converted to strings before printing.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: f is a function, and stack is an optional parameter initialized as an empty list.
def func_2(f, stack):
    return wrapped_func
    #The program returns `wrapped_func`, which is a reference to the function `f` possibly modified or wrapped with additional functionality, and `stack` remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a function `f` and an optional parameter `stack` initialized as an empty list. It returns a reference to `wrapped_func`, which is intended to be a reference to `f` possibly modified or wrapped with additional functionality. However, the actual code does not define or use `wrapped_func` anywhere, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function will raise an error and not return anything. If the function were to be fixed to define `wrapped_func`, the `stack` parameter would remain an empty list, as it is not modified within the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function signature does not provide specific variables related to the problem context. The function `wrapped_func` is a generic wrapper that accepts any arguments and keyword arguments, and it uses a stack to handle generator-based operations. It is not directly related to the problem of minimizing page turns in Ryouko's notebook.
def wrapped_func():
    if stack :
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
        #The program returns the result of calling the function `f` with the arguments `*args` and keyword arguments `
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: The function `wrapped_func` is a generic wrapper that accepts any arguments and keyword arguments, and it uses a stack to handle generator-based operations. The stack is empty.

    return to
    #The program returns the final return value from the last generator or function call that was part of the wrapped operation, originally the return value of `f(*args)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapped_func` is a generic wrapper designed to handle function calls that may involve generators. It accepts any number of positional and keyword arguments and processes them through a stack mechanism. If the function `f` called with the provided arguments returns a generator, `wrapped_func` will iterate through the generator, handling each yield and send operation until the generator is exhausted. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the stack is empty, and the function returns the final value produced by the last generator or function call. If the initial call to `f` does not return a generator, the function simply returns the result of that call. Edge cases include scenarios where the generator raises an exception or where the stack becomes corrupted (e.g., if `next` or `send` operations fail), which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer.
def func_3(t):
    for p in range(t):
        func_29()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `p` is `t-1` if `t` > 0, otherwise `p` is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `t`. It iterates from 0 to `t-1` (inclusive), calling the function `func_29` in each iteration. After the function completes, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `func_29` is not called. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop variable `p` will be `t-1` after the last iteration. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, and p is a positive integer.
def func_4(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x = x % p
    if (x == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`, `y` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a positive integer, `res` is 1, and `x` is not equal to 0
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1 == 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`, `res` is `x` raised to the power of the original value of `y` modulo `p`.
    return res
    #The program returns the value of `res` which is `x` (a non-negative integer less than `p`) raised to the power of the original value of `y` (which is 0) modulo `p`. Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, `res` is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It returns `0` if `x` is divisible by `p` (i.e., `x % p == 0`). Otherwise, it returns `x` raised to the power of `y` modulo `p`. This means the function computes `x^y % p`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `x` is a non-negative integer less than `p`, `y` is 0, and the function returns the result of the modular exponentiation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_5(n):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, ([i, n // i] for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5
    ) + 1) if n % i == 0)))
    #The program returns a set containing all the divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself, where `n` is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all the divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n`, ensuring that each divisor is only included once. It handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning the set `{1}`. The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes that the input is always a positive integer. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the returned set contains all divisors of the input integer `n`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
def func_6(a, b):
    if (a == b) :
        return a
        #The program returns a, which is a non-negative integer and currently equal to b.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: a and b are non-negative integers, and a is not equal to b
    while b > 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes in the variables `a` and `b` over multiple iterations.
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers.
    #- `a` is not equal to `b`.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #while b > 0:
    #    a, b = b, a % b
    #```
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis:
    #
    #1. **First Iteration:**
    #   - Before the loop: `a` is `a0`, `b` is `b0`.
    #   - After the loop: `a` is `b0`, `b` is `a0 % b0`.
    #   - Conditions: `b0 > 0`.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration:**
    #   - Before the loop: `a` is `b0`, `b` is `a0 % b0`.
    #   - After the loop: `a` is `a0 % b0`, `b` is `b0 % (a0 % b0)`.
    #   - Conditions: `a0 % b0 > 0`.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration:**
    #   - Before the loop: `a` is `a0 % b0`, `b` is `b0 % (a0 % b0)`.
    #   - After the loop: `a` is `b0 % (a0 % b0)`, `b` is `(a0 % b0) % (b0 % (a0 % b0))`.
    #   - Conditions: `b0 % (a0 % b0) > 0`.
    #
    #### General Pattern:
    #- Each iteration reduces `b` to a smaller non-negative integer.
    #- The loop continues until `b` becomes `0`.
    #- When `b` becomes `0`, the loop terminates, and `a` holds the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.
    #
    #### Final Output State:
    #- The loop will terminate when `b` becomes `0`.
    #- At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #**`a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is `0`.**
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `a` (which is also the GCD in this case). If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD and returns it. The function ensures that the returned value is always a non-negative integer. Edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is zero, in which case the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of integers.
def func_7(ar):
    return list(accumulate(ar))
    #The program returns a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list 'ar' up to that position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar` up to that position. If the input list `ar` is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not modify the original list `ar`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ar is a list of integers.
def func_8(ar):
    return list(accumulate(ar[::-1]))[::-1]
    #The program returns a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The cumulative sums are then reversed to match the original order of `ar`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The cumulative sums are then reversed to match the original order of `ar`. The function correctly handles empty lists and lists with a single element, returning an empty list or a list with the same single element, respectively.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters.
def func_9():
    return int(func_17())
    #The program returns an integer value produced by the function `func_17()`. The specific value depends on the implementation of `func_17()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value produced by the function `func_17()`. The specific value returned depends entirely on the implementation of `func_17()`. If `func_17()` raises an exception or returns a non-integer value, `func_9` will also raise an exception or produce unexpected behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, and a is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
def func_10():
    func_1('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'YES' as its argument. The state of the program after `func_10` completes is dependent on the behavior of `func_1`, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, the final state of the program cannot be determined solely from the given information. The annotations provided do not match the actual code, as they suggest the function should accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, but the function signature and body do not reflect this.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters.
def func_11():
    func_1('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the argument 'NO'. The specific behavior or side effects of `func_1` are not specified, so the final state of the program after `func_11` concludes depends on what `func_1` does. If `func_1` has no side effects, the program state remains unchanged. If `func_1` modifies global variables, writes to a file, or performs any other side effects, those changes will be reflected in the program state after `func_11` completes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_12` does not contain any parameters or use any variables related to the problem statement. It simply calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as an argument. Since there are no variables in the function signature related to the problem, it is not possible to derive a precondition based on the function signature alone.

However, if you need a precondition based on the problem description and typical requirements for solving the problem, here is a general precondition that could be associated with a function designed to solve this problem:

**n and m are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, and a is a list of m integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.**

This precondition reflects the constraints given in the problem description and would typically apply to a function that processes the input for this problem. However, it does not directly relate to the provided `func_12` function.
def func_12():
    func_1('Yes')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'Yes' as an argument. The function does not return any value explicitly. After the function `func_12` concludes, the state of the program is unchanged except for the side effects caused by the call to `func_1('Yes')`. If `func_1` modifies any global variables or has other side effects, those changes will persist. However, since the specific behavior of `func_1` is not provided, we can only conclude that `func_12` triggers `func_1` with the string 'Yes'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105), and a is a list of m integers where each element ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ n.
def func_13():
    func_1('No')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the argument 'No'. The provided annotations and postconditions do not match the actual code. The function does not process any input parameters `n`, `m`, or `a`, nor does it check for valid ranges or return error messages. The function simply calls `func_1('No')` and the state of the program after the function concludes is unchanged except for the side effects of `func_1('No')`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer.
def func_14(i):
    i = i - (i >> 1 & 1431655765)
    i = (i & 858993459) + (i >> 2 & 858993459)
    return ((i + (i >> 4) & 252645135) * 16843009 & 4294967295) >> 24
    #The program returns the result of `((i_new + (i_new >> 4) & 252645135) * 16843009 & 4294967295) >> 24`, where `i_new` is the value of `i` after being updated to `(i & 858993459) + (i >> 2 & 858993459)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `i` and performs a series of bitwise operations on it. It returns an integer that is the result of these operations. Specifically, the function modifies `i` by subtracting the result of a bitwise right shift and AND operation, then combines the results of further bitwise operations. The final output is the result of a complex bitwise calculation, which is designed to transform the input integer in a specific way. The function does not have any side effects and only returns a single integer value. Edge cases, such as very large or very small values of `i`, are handled by the bitwise operations, ensuring that the result is always within the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b ≠ 0.
def func_15(a, b):
    return abs(a // func_6(a, b) * b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the result of `a // func_6(a, b) * b`, where `func_6(a, b)` is an unknown function that returns an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` takes two integers `a` and `b` (with `b` ≠ 0) as parameters and returns the absolute value of the result of the expression `a // func_6(a, b) * b`. Here, `func_6(a, b)` is an unknown function that returns an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned value is the absolute value of the floor division of `a` by the result of `func_6(a, b)`, multiplied by `b`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_6(a, b)` returns 0 or negative values, which could affect the result of the floor division and the final absolute value calculation.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and r are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= n.
def func_16(n, r):
    if (n < r) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        return fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod
        #The program returns the value of `fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod`, where `fac` is a list containing factorials, `finv` is a list containing modular inverses of factorials, and `mod` is a constant used for modular arithmetic. The variables `n` and `r` are non-negative integers with `0 <= r <= n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` accepts two parameters `n` and `r`, both of which are non-negative integers with the condition `0 <= r <= n`. The function returns `0` if `n` is less than `r`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `fac[n] * (finv[r] * finv[n - r] % mod) % mod`, where `fac` is a list of precomputed factorials, `finv` is a list of precomputed modular inverses of factorials, and `mod` is a constant used for modular arithmetic. The function assumes that the lists `fac` and `finv` are already defined and correctly populated with the appropriate values. If `n` is less than `r`, the function handles this edge case by returning `0`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and reads input from stdin, which is not directly related to the variables in the function signature.
def func_17():
    return sys.stdin.readline().rstrip('\r\n')
    #The program returns a string read from the standard input (stdin), with the newline character(s) removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` reads a line from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string with trailing newline characters (including both `\r` and `\n`) removed. If the input is empty or contains no trailing newline characters, the function will still return the input as a string without modification. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: var is a value of any type that can be converted to a string.
def func_18(var):
    sys.stdout.write(str(var))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `var` of any type that can be converted to a string. It writes the string representation of `var` to the standard output (stdout) and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function call is that the string representation of `var` has been printed to stdout, and `var` remains unchanged. If `var` cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used; the function calls another function `func_17` and processes its output.
def func_19():
    return list(map(int, func_17().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the string returned by `func_17()` and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_19` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into substrings based on whitespace, and each substring is converted to an integer. The resulting list of integers is returned. If `func_17` returns a string that cannot be split or contains non-integer values, a `ValueError` may be raised during the conversion process. Additionally, if `func_17` returns an empty string, the function will return an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters, and it relies on the output of `func_17()`. It assumes that `func_17()` returns a string that can be split into a list of strings.
def func_20():
    return list(map(str, func_17().split()))
    #The program returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines), and each substring is converted to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the substrings are already strings). The function returns this list of substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_20` will return an empty list. If `func_17` returns a string with no spaces, `func_20` will return a list containing a single element, which is the original string. If `func_17` returns a string with multiple consecutive whitespace characters, `func_20` will return a list where consecutive whitespace characters are treated as a single delimiter, resulting in empty strings in the list only if there are leading or trailing spaces in the original string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used; the function `func_21` calls another function `func_17` and processes its output.
def func_21():
    return map(int, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the string returned by `func_17()` into an integer. The string from `func_17()` is split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_21` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split by whitespace, and each resulting substring is converted to an integer using the `map` function. The function returns a map object containing these integers. If `func_17` returns an empty string or a string without any whitespace, `func_21` will return a map object that, when iterated over, will yield zero or one integer respectively. If `func_17` returns a string with non-integer substrings, `func_21` will raise a `ValueError` when the map object is evaluated.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters.
def func_22():
    return map(str, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element resulting from splitting the string returned by `func_17()` by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_22` does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object that applies the `str` function to each element in the list generated by splitting the string returned by `func_17()` by spaces. If `func_17()` returns an empty string, the function will return an empty map object. If `func_17()` returns a string with multiple consecutive spaces or leading/trailing spaces, these will be treated as delimiters, and the resulting map object will contain only non-empty substrings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. It relies on the output of `func_17()` which is expected to return a string that can be split and converted into a list of floats.
def func_23():
    return map(float, func_17().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the string returned by `func_17()`, after splitting it, into a float. The exact values depend on the output of `func_17()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:`func_23` does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object that attempts to convert each substring, obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()`, into a float. If `func_17()` returns a string that cannot be split (e.g., an empty string or a string without spaces), the map object will still be returned, but attempting to iterate over it might result in errors if the substrings cannot be converted to floats. The exact values and behavior of the map object depend on the output of `func_17()`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables used in the function signature are relevant to the problem's context or the function's operation.
def func_24():
    func_18('\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_18` with a newline character (`'\n'`) as an argument. After the function `func_24` completes its execution, the state of the program is unchanged except for the side effects that `func_18` might produce when called with `'\n'`. Since the return value of `func_18` is not captured or used, the overall effect of `func_24` is solely dependent on the behavior of `func_18` with the given argument.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, and v is a value of any type.
def func_25(n, v):
    return [v] * n
    #The program returns a list containing `n` repetitions of `v`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `v` is a value of any type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_25` accepts two parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer) and `v` (a value of any type). It returns a list containing `n` repetitions of `v`. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. The function does not modify any external state or variables and operates solely on its input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and v is a value of any type.
def func_26(n, m, v):
    return [([v] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list containing `n` sublists, each of which is a list of length `m` filled with the value `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_26` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `v`. It returns a list containing `n` sublists, each of which is a list of length `m` filled with the value `v`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `v` can be any type of value. If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. If `m` is 0, the function returns a list containing `n` empty sublists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and p are non-negative integers, v is a value of any type.
def func_27(n, m, p, v):
    return [[([v] * p) for _ in range(m)] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a nested list structure with `n` layers of lists, where each layer contains `m` sublists, and each sublist contains `p` instances of the value `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_27` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `p`, and `v`. It returns a nested list structure with `n` layers of lists, where each layer contains `m` sublists, and each sublist contains `p` instances of the value `v`. 

- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- If `m` is 0, the function returns a list containing `n` empty lists.
- If `p` is 0, the function returns a list containing `n` layers, each with `m` empty sublists.
- If `v` is mutable (e.g., a list), changes to `v` in one part of the nested list will affect all other references to `v` within the same sublist due to the way lists are created using multiplication.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that b > 0.
def func_28(a, b):
    return (a + b - 1) // b
    #The program returns the integer division result of (a + b - 1) by b, where a and b are integers and b > 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_28` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a positive integer (`b > 0`). It returns the integer division result of `(a + b - 1)` by `b`. This effectively computes the ceiling of the division of `a` by `b`. The function ensures that the result is always an integer, and it handles the case where `a` is less than `b` by ensuring the result is at least 1. No other edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code.

    func_1(min(totscore - redscore, totscore))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_29` processes a list `ar` of `m` integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. The function constructs an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`. It then calculates two scores: `totscore`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, and `redscore`, which is the maximum reduction in score achievable by replacing each element `i` in `ar` with the median of its adjacent elements in `adj[i]`. Finally, the function calls `func_1` with the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore`. The function does not return a value directly but affects the state by calling `func_1` with the computed result.
