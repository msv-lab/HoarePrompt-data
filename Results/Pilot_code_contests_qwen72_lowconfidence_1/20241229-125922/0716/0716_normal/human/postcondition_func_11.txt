The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the argument 'NO'. The specific behavior or side effects of `func_1` are not specified, so the final state of the program after `func_11` concludes depends on what `func_1` does. If `func_1` has no side effects, the program state remains unchanged. If `func_1` modifies global variables, writes to a file, or performs any other side effects, those changes will be reflected in the program state after `func_11` completes.
