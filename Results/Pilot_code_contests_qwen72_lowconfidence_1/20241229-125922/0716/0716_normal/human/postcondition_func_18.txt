The function `func_18` accepts a parameter `var` of any type that can be converted to a string. It writes the string representation of `var` to the standard output (stdout) and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function call is that the string representation of `var` has been printed to stdout, and `var` remains unchanged. If `var` cannot be converted to a string, a `TypeError` will be raised.
