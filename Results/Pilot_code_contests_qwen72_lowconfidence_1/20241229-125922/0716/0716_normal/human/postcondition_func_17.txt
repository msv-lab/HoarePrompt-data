The function `func_17` reads a line from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string with trailing newline characters (including both `\r` and `\n`) removed. If the input is empty or contains no trailing newline characters, the function will still return the input as a string without modification. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external state.
