The function `func_8` accepts a list of integers `ar` and returns a new list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the original list `ar`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The cumulative sums are then reversed to match the original order of `ar`. The function correctly handles empty lists and lists with a single element, returning an empty list or a list with the same single element, respectively.
