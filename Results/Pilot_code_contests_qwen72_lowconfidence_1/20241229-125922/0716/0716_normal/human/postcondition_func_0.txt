The function `func_1` takes a variable number of positional arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`). It prints the items in `args` to a specified output stream (default is `sys.stdout`), using the following formatting options from `kwargs`: `sep` (separator between items, default is a space), `end` (string appended after the last item, default is a newline), and `flush` (a boolean indicating whether to forcibly flush the stream, default is `False`). After the function executes, the items in `args` are concatenated into the specified stream, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. If `flush` is `True`, the buffer of the stream is flushed. The function modifies the `kwargs` dictionary by removing the keys `sep`, `end`, and `flush` if they are present. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include an empty `args` tuple, where nothing is printed except the `end` string, and handling of non-string values in `args` which are converted to strings before printing.
