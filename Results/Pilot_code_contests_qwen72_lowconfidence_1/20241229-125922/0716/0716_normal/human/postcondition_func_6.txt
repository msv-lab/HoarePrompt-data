The function `func_6` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input. It returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, the function returns `a` (which is also the GCD in this case). If `a` is not equal to `b`, the function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD and returns it. The function ensures that the returned value is always a non-negative integer. Edge cases include when either `a` or `b` is zero, in which case the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD.
