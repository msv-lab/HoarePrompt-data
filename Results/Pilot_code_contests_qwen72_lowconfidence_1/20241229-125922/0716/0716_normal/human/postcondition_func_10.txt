The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It calls another function `func_1` with the string 'YES' as its argument. The state of the program after `func_10` completes is dependent on the behavior of `func_1`, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, the final state of the program cannot be determined solely from the given information. The annotations provided do not match the actual code, as they suggest the function should accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, but the function signature and body do not reflect this.
