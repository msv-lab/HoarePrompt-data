The function `func_28` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer and `b` is a positive integer (`b > 0`). It returns the integer division result of `(a + b - 1)` by `b`. This effectively computes the ceiling of the division of `a` by `b`. The function ensures that the result is always an integer, and it handles the case where `a` is less than `b` by ensuring the result is at least 1. No other edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code.
