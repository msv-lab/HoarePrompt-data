The function `func_5` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a set containing all the divisors of `n`, including 1 and `n` itself. The function correctly identifies and includes all divisors of `n`, ensuring that each divisor is only included once. It handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by returning the set `{1}`. The function does not handle non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes that the input is always a positive integer. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the returned set contains all divisors of the input integer `n`.
