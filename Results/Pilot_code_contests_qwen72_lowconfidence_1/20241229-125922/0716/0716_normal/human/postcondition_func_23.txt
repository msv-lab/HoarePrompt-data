`func_23` does not accept any parameters. It returns a map object that attempts to convert each substring, obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_17()`, into a float. If `func_17()` returns a string that cannot be split (e.g., an empty string or a string without spaces), the map object will still be returned, but attempting to iterate over it might result in errors if the substrings cannot be converted to floats. The exact values and behavior of the map object depend on the output of `func_17()`.
