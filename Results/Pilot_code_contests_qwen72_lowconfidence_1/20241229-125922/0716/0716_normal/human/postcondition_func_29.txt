The function `func_29` processes a list `ar` of `m` integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105. The function constructs an adjacency list `adj` where `adj[i]` contains the indices of elements in `ar` that are adjacent to `i` and are not equal to `i`. It then calculates two scores: `totscore`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `ar`, and `redscore`, which is the maximum reduction in score achievable by replacing each element `i` in `ar` with the median of its adjacent elements in `adj[i]`. Finally, the function calls `func_1` with the minimum of `totscore` and `totscore - redscore`. The function does not return a value directly but affects the state by calling `func_1` with the computed result.
