The function `func_2` accepts a function `f` and an optional parameter `stack` initialized as an empty list. It returns a reference to `wrapped_func`, which is intended to be a reference to `f` possibly modified or wrapped with additional functionality. However, the actual code does not define or use `wrapped_func` anywhere, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called. As a result, the function will raise an error and not return anything. If the function were to be fixed to define `wrapped_func`, the `stack` parameter would remain an empty list, as it is not modified within the function.
