The function `func_15` takes two integers `a` and `b` (with `b` â‰  0) as parameters and returns the absolute value of the result of the expression `a // func_6(a, b) * b`. Here, `func_6(a, b)` is an unknown function that returns an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned value is the absolute value of the floor division of `a` by the result of `func_6(a, b)`, multiplied by `b`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `func_6(a, b)` returns 0 or negative values, which could affect the result of the floor division and the final absolute value calculation.
