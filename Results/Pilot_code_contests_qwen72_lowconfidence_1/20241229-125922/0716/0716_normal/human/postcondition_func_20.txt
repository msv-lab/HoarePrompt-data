The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. It calls another function `func_17`, which is expected to return a string. This string is then split into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines), and each substring is converted to a string (though this conversion is redundant since the substrings are already strings). The function returns this list of substrings. If `func_17` returns an empty string, `func_20` will return an empty list. If `func_17` returns a string with no spaces, `func_20` will return a list containing a single element, which is the original string. If `func_17` returns a string with multiple consecutive whitespace characters, `func_20` will return a list where consecutive whitespace characters are treated as a single delimiter, resulting in empty strings in the list only if there are leading or trailing spaces in the original string.
