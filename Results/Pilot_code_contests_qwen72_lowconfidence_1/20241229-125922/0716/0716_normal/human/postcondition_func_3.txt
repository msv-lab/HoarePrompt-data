The function `func_3` accepts a non-negative integer `t`. It iterates from 0 to `t-1` (inclusive), calling the function `func_29` in each iteration. After the function completes, the value of `t` remains unchanged. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `func_29` is not called. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop variable `p` will be `t-1` after the last iteration. The function does not return any value.
