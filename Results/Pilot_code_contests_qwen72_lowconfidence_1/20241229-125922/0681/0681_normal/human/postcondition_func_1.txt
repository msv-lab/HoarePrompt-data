The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s). It modifies the string by adding 'Y' at both the beginning and end, replaces all '?' characters with 'N', and then checks if there exists a substring of length `k` that consists entirely of 'N' characters, surrounded by either 'Y' or '?'. If such a substring is found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. The function does not modify the original string `s` or the integer `k`.
