The code `seq_N = s1.replace('?', 'N')` replaces all occurrences of the character '?' in the string `s1` with the character 'N'. 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s).
- `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y'.

After executing the code, `seq_N` will be the string `s1` with all '?' characters replaced by 'N'. The original values of `s`, `k`, and `s1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y', `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y'**
