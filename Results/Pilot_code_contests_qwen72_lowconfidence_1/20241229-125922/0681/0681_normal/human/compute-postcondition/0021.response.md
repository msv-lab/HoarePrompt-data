The code snippet `max_r = r` updates the value of `max_r` to the value of `r`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `s` is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?", and must have at least 3 characters.
- `r` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the third character of `s`.
- `max_r` is 0 or 1.
- `i` is 2.
- If the first character of `s` is 'N', `max_r` is 1.
- If `s[2]` is 'N', `r` is 2; otherwise, `r` is 1 if `s[2]` is 'N' and 0 if `s[2]` is not 'N'.
- If `r` is greater than `max_r`, `max_r` is updated to the value of `r`; otherwise, `max_r` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is determined based on the third character of `s`.
- `max_r` is updated to the value of `r`.

After executing `max_r = r`, the new state is:
- `s` is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?" and must have at least 3 characters.
- `r` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the third character of `s`.
- `max_r` is now equal to `r`.
- `i` is 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?" and must have at least 3 characters, `r` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the third character of `s`, `max_r` is equal to `r`, `i` is 2.**
