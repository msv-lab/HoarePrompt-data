The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s` and `k`. `s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s). The function has four cases that determine its return value:

- Case_1: The program returns 1
- Case_2: The program returns 1
- Case_3: The program returns 1
- Case_4: The program returns 0

Since all cases except the last one return 1, and the last case returns 0, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ len(s)). It returns 1 in most cases, and returns 0 in a specific case.**
