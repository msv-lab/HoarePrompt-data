Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?" and must have at least 3 characters, `r` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the third character of `s`, `max_r` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is 'N', `max_r` is 1. If `s[2]` is 'N', `r` is 2, otherwise `r` is 1 if `s[2]` is 'N' and 0 if `s[2]` is not 'N'. If `r` is greater than `max_r`, `max_r` is updated to the value of `r`. Otherwise, `max_r` remains unchanged.***
