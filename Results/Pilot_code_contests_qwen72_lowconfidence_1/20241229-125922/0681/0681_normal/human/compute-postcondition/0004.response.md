Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y', `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y', `i` is 0, and `len(seq_N)` is at least 2. Additionally, the first `k` characters of `seq_N` are all 'N'. The character `s1[i - 1]` is either 'Y' or '?', and the character `s1[i + k]` is either 'Y' or '?'.***
