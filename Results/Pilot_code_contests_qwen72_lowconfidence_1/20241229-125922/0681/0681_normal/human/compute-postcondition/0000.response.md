The code snippet concatenates the character 'Y' at the beginning and end of the string `s`, and assigns this new string to the variable `s1`. The length of `s1` will be the length of `s` plus 2. The variable `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **s is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), s1 is 'Y' + s + 'Y'**
