Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y', `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y', `i` is 2, and `len(seq_N)` is at least 2. If `seq_N[i:i + k]` is 'N' * k and `s1[i - 1]` is in ['Y', '?'] and `s1[i + k]` is in ['Y', '?'], the program returns 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
