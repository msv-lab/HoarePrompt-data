Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s). It modifies the string by adding 'Y' at both the beginning and end, replaces all '?' characters with 'N', and then checks if there exists a substring of length `k` that consists entirely of 'N' characters, surrounded by either 'Y' or '?'. If such a substring is found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. The function does not modify the original string `s` or the integer `k`. **

### Key Points:
- **Input Parameters:**
  - `s`: A string containing only 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters.
  - `k`: A non-negative integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s).

- **Output:**
  - Returns 1 if there exists a substring of length `k` in the modified string (with 'Y' added at both ends and '?' replaced with 'N') that is entirely composed of 'N' characters and is surrounded by either 'Y' or '?'.
  - Returns 0 if no such substring exists.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `k` is 0, the function will always return 0 because a substring of length 0 cannot meet the conditions.
  - If `s` contains no '?' characters, the function will only check for sequences of 'N' without any replacements.
  - If `s` is empty, the function will return 0 because the modified string will be 'YY', which cannot contain a substring of length `k` (where `k > 0`).

- **Missing Logic:**
  - The annotations suggest that the function returns 1 in most cases, but the code itself clearly returns 0 if no valid substring is found, which is a correct and necessary part of the function's behavior.
