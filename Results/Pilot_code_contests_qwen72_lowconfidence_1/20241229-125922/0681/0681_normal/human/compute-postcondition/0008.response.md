To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s).
- `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y'.
- `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y'.
- `i` is 0.
- `len(seq_N)` is at least 2.
- If the first `k` characters of `seq_N` are all 'N', then either `s1[i - 1]` is not in ['Y', '?'] or `s1[i + k]` is not in ['Y', '?'].

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(seq_N)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(seq_N)`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition about the first `k` characters of `seq_N` being all 'N' and the constraints on `s1[i - 1]` and `s1[i + k]` must still hold true for the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 1 (since it was 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1).
- The length of `seq_N` remains the same and must still be at least 2.
- The condition about the first `k` characters of `seq_N` being all 'N' and the constraints on `s1[i - 1]` and `s1[i + k]` must still hold true for the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y', `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y', `i` is 1, and `len(seq_N)` is at least 2. If the first `k` characters of `seq_N` are all 'N', then either `s1[i - 1]` is not in ['Y', '?'] or `s1[i + k]` is not in ['Y', '?']**.
