The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?". It returns the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters found in `s`. After the function concludes, `s` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of 'N' characters in `s`. Edge cases include an empty string, where the function returns 0, and a string with no 'N' characters, where the function also returns 0.
