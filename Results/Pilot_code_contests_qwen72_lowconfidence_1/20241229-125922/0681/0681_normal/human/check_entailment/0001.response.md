Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` is designed to check if the dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to `k`, but it fails to consider all possible configurations of the '?' characters. The current implementation only checks if a sequence of `k` 'N's can be formed by replacing '?' with 'N', and it does not ensure that no longer sequence of 'N's can be formed, which is necessary to ensure the dissatisfaction is exactly `k`.

For example, consider the input:
```
6 1
????NN
```

The correct output should be "NO" because even if we replace some '?' with 'N', the dissatisfaction will always be at least 2 due to the last two 'N's. However, the given program might incorrectly return "YES" because it does not properly check all configurations of '?' to ensure the dissatisfaction is exactly `k`.

This is a clear case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
