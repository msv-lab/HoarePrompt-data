Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to \( k \). Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It then reads a string \( \text{seq} \) representing Stepan's memory of watching episodes.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters in the given string \( s \).
   - It iterates through the string and keeps a running count of consecutive 'N' characters, updating the maximum count whenever a non-'N' character is encountered.
   - The function returns the maximum count of consecutive 'N' characters.

3. **Initial Check with All 'Y':**
   - The program creates a new string \( \text{seq_Y} \) by replacing all '?' characters in \( \text{seq} \) with 'Y'.
   - It then calls `func_1` on \( \text{seq_Y} \) to get the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters if all '?' were 'Y'.
   - If this maximum number is greater than \( k \), it prints 'NO' because Stepan's dissatisfaction cannot be exactly \( k \) if it is already greater than \( k \).

4. **Exact Match Check:**
   - If the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters is exactly \( k \), it prints 'YES' because Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly \( k \).

5. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if it is possible to achieve exactly \( k \) consecutive 'N' characters by considering the '?' characters.
   - It creates a new string \( \text{s1} \) by adding 'Y' at the beginning and end of \( \text{seq} \).
   - It then replaces all '?' characters in \( \text{s1} \) with 'N' to create \( \text{seq_N} \).
   - It iterates through \( \text{seq_N} \) to find any substring of length \( k \) that consists entirely of 'N' characters.
   - It also checks the characters immediately before and after the substring to ensure they are either 'Y' or '?'.
   - If such a substring is found, it returns 1 (indicating a match).
   - If no such substring is found, it returns 0 (indicating no match).

6. **Final Check:**
   - If the initial check with all 'Y' does not result in a 'NO' and the exact match check does not result in a 'YES', the program calls `func_2` to check if it is possible to achieve exactly \( k \) consecutive 'N' characters by considering the '?' characters.
   - If `func_2` returns 1, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `func_2` returns 0, it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly \( k \) by checking all possible scenarios, including the cases where '?' characters can be replaced with 'Y' or 'N'. Therefore, the program is correct.
