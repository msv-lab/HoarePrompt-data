You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had n episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not. 

Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.

Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. 

The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the i-th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.

Output

If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to k, then print "YES" (without qoutes). Otherwise print "NO" (without qoutes).

Examples

Input

5 2
NYNNY


Output

YES


Input

6 1
????NN


Output

NO

Note

In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is 2, because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number 3 and the episode number 4. The answer is "YES", because k = 2.

In the second test k = 1, Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to 2 (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number 5 and number 6), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.
Program:
```
import sys
import re
#Function 1:
def func_1(s):
    r = 0
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'N':
            r += 1
        else:
            r = 0
        if r > max_r:
            max_r = r
    return max_r

#Function 2:
def func_2(s, k):
    s1 = 'Y' + s + 'Y'
    seq_N = s1.replace('?', 'N')
    for i in range(len(seq_N)):
        if seq_N[i:i + k] == 'N' * k:
            if s1[i - 1] in ['Y', '?'] and s1[i + k] in ['Y', '?']:
                return 1
    return 0


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` is intended to check if the dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to `k`, but it fails in certain scenarios. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling of '?' Characters**:
   - The function replaces all '?' characters with 'N' to create the worst-case scenario. However, it then checks if there exists a sequence of exactly `k` consecutive 'N' characters. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of '?' characters being replaced with 'Y' to break sequences of 'N'.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function adds 'Y' at the beginning and end of the string `s1` to handle edge cases. However, this does not always ensure that the sequence of 'N' is correctly identified as being exactly `k` long. For example, consider the input:
     ```
     6 2
     ????NN
     ```
     The function will replace '?' with 'N', resulting in `YYYYNN`. It will then check for sequences of exactly 2 'N' characters, which it will find. However, the correct answer should be "NO" because even if all '?' are replaced with 'Y', the sequence `NN` will still exist, making the dissatisfaction at least 2, not exactly 2.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**:
   - The function returns 1 or 0, but the problem requires a "YES" or "NO" output. This is a minor issue but still indicates a mismatch with the problem requirements.

To fix these issues, the program needs to more carefully consider the placement of '?' characters and ensure that it correctly identifies whether the dissatisfaction can be exactly `k` in all possible scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s). It modifies the string by adding 'Y' at both the beginning and end, replaces all '?' characters with 'N', and then checks if there exists a substring of length `k` that consists entirely of 'N' characters, surrounded by either 'Y' or '?'. If such a substring is found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. The function does not modify the original string `s` or the integer `k`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
