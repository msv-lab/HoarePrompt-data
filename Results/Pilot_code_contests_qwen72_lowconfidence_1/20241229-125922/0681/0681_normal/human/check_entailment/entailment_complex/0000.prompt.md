You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Well, the series which Stepan watched for a very long time, ended. In total, the series had n episodes. For each of them, Stepan remembers either that he definitely has watched it, or that he definitely hasn't watched it, or he is unsure, has he watched this episode or not. 

Stepan's dissatisfaction is the maximum number of consecutive series that Stepan did not watch.

Your task is to determine according to Stepan's memories if his dissatisfaction could be exactly equal to k.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of episodes in the series and the dissatisfaction which should be checked. 

The second line contains the sequence which consists of n symbols "Y", "N" and "?". If the i-th symbol equals "Y", Stepan remembers that he has watched the episode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "N", Stepan remembers that he hasn't watched the epizode number i. If the i-th symbol equals "?", Stepan doesn't exactly remember if he has watched the episode number i or not.

Output

If Stepan's dissatisfaction can be exactly equal to k, then print "YES" (without qoutes). Otherwise print "NO" (without qoutes).

Examples

Input

5 2
NYNNY


Output

YES


Input

6 1
????NN


Output

NO

Note

In the first test Stepan remembers about all the episodes whether he has watched them or not. His dissatisfaction is 2, because he hasn't watch two episodes in a row — the episode number 3 and the episode number 4. The answer is "YES", because k = 2.

In the second test k = 1, Stepan's dissatisfaction is greater than or equal to 2 (because he remembers that he hasn't watch at least two episodes in a row — number 5 and number 6), even if he has watched the episodes from the first to the fourth, inclusive.
Annotated Functions:
import sys
import re

[n, k] = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
seq = sys.stdin.readline().split()[0]
seq_Y = seq.replace('?', 'Y')
max_N_Y = func_1(seq_Y)
if max_N_Y > k:
    print('NO')
elif max_N_Y == k:
    print('YES')
elif func_2(seq, k):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?" representing Stepan's memory of watching episodes, where "Y" means he definitely watched the episode, "N" means he definitely did not watch it, and "?" means he is unsure.
def func_1(s):
    r = 0
    max_r = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 'N':
            r += 1
        else:
            r = 0
        
        if r > max_r:
            max_r = r
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?"; `r` is 0; `max_r` is the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters found in `s`.
    return max_r
    #The program returns the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters found in the string `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters "Y", "N", and "?". It returns the maximum number of consecutive 'N' characters found in `s`. After the function concludes, `s` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the length of the longest contiguous sequence of 'N' characters in `s`. Edge cases include an empty string, where the function returns 0, and a string with no 'N' characters, where the function also returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s).
def func_2(s, k):
    s1 = 'Y' + s + 'Y'
    seq_N = s1.replace('?', 'N')
    for i in range(len(seq_N)):
        if seq_N[i:i + k] == 'N' * k:
            if s1[i - 1] in ['Y', '?'] and s1[i + k] in ['Y', '?']:
                return 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s), `s1` is 'Y' + s + 'Y', `seq_N` is 'Y' + s.replace('?', 'N') + 'Y', and the function returns 1 if there exists an `i` such that `seq_N[i:i + k] == 'N' * k` and both `s1[i - 1]` and `s1[i + k]` are in `['Y', '?']`. If no such `i` is found, the function returns `None`.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of 'Y', 'N', and '?' characters, and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ len(s). It modifies the string by adding 'Y' at both the beginning and end, replaces all '?' characters with 'N', and then checks if there exists a substring of length `k` that consists entirely of 'N' characters, surrounded by either 'Y' or '?'. If such a substring is found, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 0. The function does not modify the original string `s` or the integer `k`.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
