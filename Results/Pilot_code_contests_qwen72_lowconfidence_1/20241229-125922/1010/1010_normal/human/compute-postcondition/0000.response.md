Postcondition: **first is a boolean, let is a character, l is a list of strings, x, y, xInit, yInit, xAnt, yAnt are integers, n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and conj is a set or list. The current values of x and y are such that either (x is not greater than or equal to 0, or x is not less than n, or y is not greater than or equal to 0, or y is not less than m) or (x, y) is in conj.**
