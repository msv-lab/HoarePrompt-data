Postcondition: **first is a boolean, let is a character, l is a list of strings, x, y, xInit, yInit, xAnt, yAnt are integers, n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and conj is a set or list. Additionally, x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, y is greater than or equal to 0 and less than m, and (x, y) is not in conj. The current values of x and y are equal to xInit and yInit, respectively, and the length of conj is greater than 3.**
