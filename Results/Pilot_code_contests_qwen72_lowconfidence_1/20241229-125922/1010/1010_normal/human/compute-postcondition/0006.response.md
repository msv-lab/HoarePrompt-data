Postcondition: **first is a boolean, let is a character, l is a list of strings, x, y, xInit, yInit, xAnt, yAnt are integers, n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and conj is a set or list. Additionally, x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than n, y is greater than or equal to 0 and less than m, and (x, y) is not in conj. Either x is not equal to xInit, or y is not equal to yInit, or the length of conj is less than or equal to 3. The current value of `l[x][y]` is equal to `let`.**
