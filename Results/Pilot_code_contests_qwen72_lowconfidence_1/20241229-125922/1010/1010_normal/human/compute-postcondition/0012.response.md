The given Python code snippet calls a function `func_1` and assigns its return value to the variable `cima`. The function `func_1` is called with the following arguments: `False`, `let`, `l`, `x`, `y - 1`, `n`, `m`, `xInit`, `yInit`, `x`, `y`, and `conj`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific return value of `func_1`. However, we know that `cima` will be assigned the return value of this function call.

The impact of this code on the program is:

- The value of `cima` is updated to the return value of `func_1`.
- No other variables are directly modified by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `let` is a character, `l` is a list of strings, `x`, `y`, `xInit`, `yInit`, `xAnt`, `yAnt` are integers, `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50, and `conj` is a set or list. Additionally, `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`, `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `m`, and (`x`, `y`) is not in `conj`. Either `x` is not equal to `xInit`, or `y` is not equal to `yInit`, or the length of `conj` is less than or equal to 3. The current value of `l[x][y]` is equal to `let`. If `first` is false, (`x`, `y`) is added to `conj`, and the length of `conj` is less than or equal to 4. `cima` is the return value of `func_1(False, let, l, x, y - 1, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)`. The current value of `y - 1` is not equal to `yAnt`.**
