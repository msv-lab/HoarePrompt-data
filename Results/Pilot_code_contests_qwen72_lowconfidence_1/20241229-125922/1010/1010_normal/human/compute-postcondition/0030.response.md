Functionality: ** The function `func_1` checks if a path exists in a grid `l` starting from coordinates `(x, y)` to the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` while avoiding previously visited cells stored in `conj`. The function returns `True` if such a path exists, and `False` otherwise. Here are the key points:

1. **Parameters:**
   - `first`: A boolean indicating whether it is the first call to the function.
   - `let`: A character used to check the value of the current cell in the grid.
   - `l`: A list of strings representing the grid.
   - `x`, `y`: Current coordinates in the grid.
   - `n`, `m`: Dimensions of the grid (2 <= n, m <= 50).
   - `xInit`, `yInit`: Initial coordinates from which the path should lead back to.
   - `xAnt`, `yAnt`: Coordinates of the previous cell to avoid infinite loops.
   - `conj`: A set or list of coordinates that have already been visited.

2. **Return Values:**
   - **Case 1:** Returns `False` if the current coordinates `(x, y)` are out of bounds or have already been visited.
   - **Case 2:** Returns `True` if the current coordinates match the initial coordinates and the number of visited cells is greater than 3.
   - **Case 3:** If the current cell `l[x][y]` matches the character `let`, the function recursively checks the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) that are not the previous cell `(xAnt, yAnt)`. The function returns the logical OR of the results from these recursive calls.
   - **Case 4:** Returns `False` if the current cell `l[x][y]` does not match the character `let`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic:**
   - The function does not handle the case where the grid is empty or the dimensions `n` and `m` are less than 2, although the constraints specify that `2 <= n, m <= 50`.
   - The function assumes that the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` are valid and within the grid boundaries.
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where the initial coordinates are the same as the starting coordinates and the length of `conj` is exactly 3, which might be an edge case depending on the context.

4. **Final State:**
   - The function modifies the `conj` set or list by adding the current coordinates `(x, y)` if `first` is `False` and the current cell matches `let`.
   - The function does not modify any other input parameters.
   - The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a valid path exists from the current coordinates to the initial coordinates. **
