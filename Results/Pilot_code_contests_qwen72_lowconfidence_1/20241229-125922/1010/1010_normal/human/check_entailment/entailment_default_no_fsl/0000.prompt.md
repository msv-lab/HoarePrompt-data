You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a mobile puzzle game called "Two Dots". The basic levels are played on a board of size n × m cells, like this:

<image>

Each cell contains a dot that has some color. We will use different uppercase Latin characters to express different colors.

The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same color. Consider 4 blue dots on the picture forming a circle as an example. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:

  1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj. 
  2. k is at least 4. 
  3. All dots belong to the same color. 
  4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge. 



Determine if there exists a cycle on the field.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50): the number of rows and columns of the board.

Then n lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of m characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.

Output

Output "Yes" if there exists a cycle, and "No" otherwise.

Note

In first sample test all 'A' form a cycle.

In second sample there is no such cycle.

The third sample is displayed on the picture above ('Y' = Yellow, 'B' = Blue, 'R' = Red).
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
l = [raw_input() for i in xrange(n)]
res = False
row = 0
while row < n and (not res):
    for column in xrange(m):
        conj = set()
        tmp = func_1(True, l[row][column], l, row, column, n, m, row, column, row, column, conj)
        if tmp:
            res = True
            break
    row += 1
if res:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

def func_1(first, let, l, x, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, xAnt, yAnt, conj):
    if not (x >= 0 and x < n and (y >= 0) and (y < m)) or (x, y) in conj:
        return False
    if x == xInit and y == yInit and (len(conj) > 3):
        return True
    if l[x][y] == let:
        if not first:
            conj.add((x, y))
        cima = False
        if y - 1 != yAnt:
            cima = func_1(False, let, l, x, y - 1, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        direita = False
        if x + 1 != xAnt:
            direita = func_1(False, let, l, x + 1, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        baixo = False
        if y + 1 != yAnt:
            baixo = func_1(False, let, l, x, y + 1, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        esquerda = False
        if x - 1 != xAnt:
            esquerda = func_1(False, let, l, x - 1, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        return cima or baixo or direita or esquerda
    else:
        return False


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a path exists in a grid `l` starting from coordinates `(x, y)` to the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` while avoiding previously visited cells stored in `conj`. The function returns `True` if such a path exists, and `False` otherwise. Here are the key points:

1.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
