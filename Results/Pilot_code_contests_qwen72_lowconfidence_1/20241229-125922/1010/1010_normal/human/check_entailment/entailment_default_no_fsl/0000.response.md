Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program aims to determine if there exists a cycle of the same color on a grid. However, there are several issues with the implementation that prevent it from being correct for every potential case:

1. **Recursion Depth Limitation**: The program uses recursion to explore paths, which can lead to a stack overflow for large grids. This is not a theoretical issue but a practical one, especially given the constraints (n, m â‰¤ 50).

2. **Cycle Detection Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to detect cycles by checking if it returns to the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` with more than three cells visited. However, this logic can fail in certain cases where a cycle is present but the path taken does not return to the initial coordinates directly. For example, consider a grid where a cycle forms a loop but does not start and end at the same cell.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For instance, it does not properly manage the set of visited cells (`conj`) in all scenarios, which can lead to incorrect cycle detection or infinite loops.

4. **Path Exploration**: The program explores paths in a depth-first search manner but does not ensure that all possible paths are explored correctly. This can lead to missing valid cycles.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Example Input:**
```
4 4
ABCD
EFGH
IJKL
MNOP
```

**Expected Output:**
```
No
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may incorrectly output "Yes" due to the flawed cycle detection logic.

To fix these issues, a more robust approach would involve using a breadth-first search (BFS) or a more sophisticated depth-first search (DFS) with proper cycle detection mechanisms. Additionally, ensuring that the recursion depth is managed or using an iterative approach would help avoid stack overflow issues.
