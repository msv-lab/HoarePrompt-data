Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the board.
   - It then reads the board itself into a list of strings `l`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `res` to `False` to keep track of whether a cycle is found.
   - It iterates over each cell in the board, starting from the first row.

2. **Cycle Detection Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that attempts to find a cycle starting from a given cell `(x, y)`.
   - It uses a set `conj` to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
   - The function checks if the current cell `(x, y)` is within the bounds of the board and has not been visited yet.
   - It checks if the current cell is the same as the initial cell and if the cycle length is at least 4.
   - It recursively explores the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) while ensuring that the current cell is not revisited from the previous cell.

3. **Cycle Conditions:**
   - The function ensures that the cycle is formed by at least 4 cells of the same color.
   - It correctly handles the adjacency condition by checking the coordinates of the adjacent cells.
   - It avoids infinite loops by using the set `conj` to track visited cells.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all cells, if a cycle is found, the program prints "Yes".
   - If no cycle is found, the program prints "No".

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Boundary Conditions:** The program correctly checks if the current cell is within the bounds of the board.
- **Cycle Length:** The program ensures that the cycle length is at least 4 by checking the length of the set `conj`.
- **Same Color Condition:** The program ensures that all cells in the cycle are of the same color by comparing the color of the current cell with the initial cell.
- **Adjacency Condition:** The program correctly checks the adjacency of cells by moving up, down, left, and right from the current cell, while avoiding revisiting the previous cell.

Given these points, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
