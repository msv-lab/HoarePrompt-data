Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the algorithm to detect cycles of the same color in a grid. Here's a breakdown of why it seems to meet the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself correctly using `raw_input()` (note that `raw_input()` is used in Python 2; in Python 3, `input()` would be used).

2. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` is used to recursively explore the grid to find cycles. It uses a set `conj` to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them and to ensure that the cycle length is at least 4.

3. **Boundary and Adjacency Checks**: The function checks if the current cell is within the grid boundaries and if it has already been visited. It also ensures that the next cell to visit is not the previous cell (`xAnt`, `yAnt`) to avoid backtracking immediately.

4. **Cycle Completion**: When the function returns to the initial cell (`xInit`, `yInit`) and the set `conj` has more than 3 elements, it confirms a valid cycle.

5. **Termination and Output**: The main loop iterates over each cell in the grid, and if a cycle is found, it prints "Yes" and terminates. If no cycle is found after checking all cells, it prints "No".

The program handles all the conditions specified in the problem description, including:
- Ensuring the cycle is at least 4 dots long.
- Ensuring all dots in the cycle are of the same color.
- Ensuring the cycle is formed by adjacent dots.

Given these points, the program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
