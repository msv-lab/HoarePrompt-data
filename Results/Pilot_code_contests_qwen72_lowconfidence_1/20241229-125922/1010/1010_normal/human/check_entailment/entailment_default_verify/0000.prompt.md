You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a mobile puzzle game called "Two Dots". The basic levels are played on a board of size n × m cells, like this:

<image>

Each cell contains a dot that has some color. We will use different uppercase Latin characters to express different colors.

The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same color. Consider 4 blue dots on the picture forming a circle as an example. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:

  1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj. 
  2. k is at least 4. 
  3. All dots belong to the same color. 
  4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge. 



Determine if there exists a cycle on the field.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50): the number of rows and columns of the board.

Then n lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of m characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.

Output

Output "Yes" if there exists a cycle, and "No" otherwise.

Note

In second sample there is no such cycle.

The third sample is displayed on the picture above ('Y' = Yellow, 'B' = Blue, 'R' = Red).
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
l = [raw_input() for i in xrange(n)]
res = False
row = 0
while row < n and (not res):
    for column in xrange(m):
        conj = set()
        tmp = func_1(True, l[row][column], l, row, column, n, m, row, column, row, column, conj)
        if tmp:
            res = True
            break
    row += 1
if res:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

def func_1(first, let, l, x, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, xAnt, yAnt, conj):
    if not (x >= 0 and x < n and (y >= 0) and (y < m)) or (x, y) in conj:
        return False
    if x == xInit and y == yInit and (len(conj) > 3):
        return True
    if l[x][y] == let:
        if not first:
            conj.add((x, y))
        cima = False
        if y - 1 != yAnt:
            cima = func_1(False, let, l, x, y - 1, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        direita = False
        if x + 1 != xAnt:
            direita = func_1(False, let, l, x + 1, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        baixo = False
        if y + 1 != yAnt:
            baixo = func_1(False, let, l, x, y + 1, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        esquerda = False
        if x - 1 != xAnt:
            esquerda = func_1(False, let, l, x - 1, y, n, m, xInit, yInit, x, y, conj)
        return cima or baixo or direita or esquerda
    else:
        return False

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the algorithm to detect cycles of the same color in a grid. Here's a breakdown of why it seems to meet the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the dimensions of the grid and the grid itself correctly using `raw_input()` (note that `raw_input()` is used in Python 2; in Python 3, `input()` would be used).

2. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` is used to recursively explore the grid to find cycles. It uses a set `conj` to keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them and to ensure that the cycle length is at least 4.

3. **Boundary and Adjacency Checks**: The function checks if the current cell is within the grid boundaries and if it has already been visited. It also ensures that the next cell to visit is not the previous cell (`xAnt`, `yAnt`) to avoid backtracking immediately.

4. **Cycle Completion**: When the function returns to the initial cell (`xInit`, `yInit`) and the set `conj` has more than 3 elements, it confirms a valid cycle.

5. **Termination and Output**: The main loop iterates over each cell in the grid, and if a cycle is found, it prints "Yes" and terminates. If no cycle is found after checking all cells, it prints "No".

The program handles all the conditions specified in the problem description, including:
- Ensuring the cycle is at least 4 dots long.
- Ensuring all dots in the cycle are of the same color.
- Ensuring the cycle is formed by adjacent dots.

Given these points, the program seems to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks if a path exists in a grid `l` starting from coordinates `(x, y)` to the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` while avoiding previously visited cells stored in `conj`. The function returns `True` if such a path exists, and `False` otherwise. Here are the key points:

1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
