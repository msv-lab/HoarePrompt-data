You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Fox Ciel is playing a mobile puzzle game called "Two Dots". The basic levels are played on a board of size n × m cells, like this:

<image>

Each cell contains a dot that has some color. We will use different uppercase Latin characters to express different colors.

The key of this game is to find a cycle that contain dots of same color. Consider 4 blue dots on the picture forming a circle as an example. Formally, we call a sequence of dots d1, d2, ..., dk a cycle if and only if it meets the following condition:

  1. These k dots are different: if i ≠ j then di is different from dj. 
  2. k is at least 4. 
  3. All dots belong to the same color. 
  4. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ k - 1: di and di + 1 are adjacent. Also, dk and d1 should also be adjacent. Cells x and y are called adjacent if they share an edge. 



Determine if there exists a cycle on the field.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50): the number of rows and columns of the board.

Then n lines follow, each line contains a string consisting of m characters, expressing colors of dots in each line. Each character is an uppercase Latin letter.

Output

Output "Yes" if there exists a cycle, and "No" otherwise.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for detecting cycles of the same color in a grid. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid `l`.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_1` is designed to perform a depth-first search (DFS) to detect cycles. It keeps track of visited cells using a set `conj` and ensures that the cycle is valid by checking the conditions specified in the problem description:
   - The cycle must contain at least 4 dots.
   - All dots in the cycle must be of the same color.
   - Each dot in the cycle must be adjacent to the next dot in the sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as:
   - Ensuring the current cell is within the grid boundaries.
   - Avoiding revisiting the same cell more than once.
   - Ensuring the initial cell is revisited to form a valid cycle.

4. **Termination**: The program correctly terminates and prints "Yes" if a valid cycle is found, and "No" otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to cover all potential cases and correctly identify the presence or absence of a cycle. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
l = [raw_input() for i in xrange(n)]
res = False
row = 0
while row < n and (not res):
    for column in xrange(m):
        conj = set()
        tmp = func_1(True, l[row][column], l, row, column, n, m, row, column, row, column, conj)
        if tmp:
            res = True
            break
    row += 1
if res:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')

Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
