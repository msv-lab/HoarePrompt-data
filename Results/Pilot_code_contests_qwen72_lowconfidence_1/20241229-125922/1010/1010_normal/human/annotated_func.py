#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks if a path exists in a grid `l` starting from coordinates `(x, y)` to the initial coordinates `(xInit, yInit)` while avoiding previously visited cells stored in `conj`. The function returns `True` if such a path exists, and `False` otherwise. Here are the key points:
