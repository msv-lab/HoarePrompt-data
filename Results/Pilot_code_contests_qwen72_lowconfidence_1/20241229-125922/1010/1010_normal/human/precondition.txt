first is a boolean, let is a character, l is a list of strings where each string has length m, x and y are integers representing the current position on the board (0 ≤ x < n and 0 ≤ y < m), n and m are integers representing the dimensions of the board (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 50), xInit and yInit are integers representing the initial position (0 ≤ xInit < n and 0 ≤ yInit < m), xAnt and yAnt are integers representing the previous position (0 ≤ xAnt < n and 0 ≤ yAnt < m), and conj is a set of tuples representing visited positions.
