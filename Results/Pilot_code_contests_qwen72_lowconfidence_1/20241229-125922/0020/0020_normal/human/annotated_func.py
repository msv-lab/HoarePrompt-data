#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer representing the number to be converted, b is an integer representing the base (radix) of the numeral system where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10, and numerals is a string containing the symbols used to represent the digits in the numeral system, defaulting to '0123456789'.
def func_1(num, b, numerals):
    return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]
    #The program returns a string representation of `num` in base `b`, constructed by recursively calling `func_1` with `num // b` and concatenating the remainder of `num % b` using the `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the program returns '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` to its string representation in a specified base `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10) using the provided `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the function returns '0'. For non-zero `num`, the function recursively constructs the string by repeatedly dividing `num` by `b` and appending the corresponding symbol from `numerals` based on the remainder of `num % b`. However, the current implementation has a flaw: it does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. Additionally, the function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string.
