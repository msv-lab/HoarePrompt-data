The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` to its string representation in a specified base `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10) using the provided `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the function returns '0'. For non-zero `num`, the function recursively constructs the string by repeatedly dividing `num` by `b` and appending the corresponding symbol from `numerals` based on the remainder of `num % b`. However, the current implementation has a flaw: it does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. Additionally, the function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string.
