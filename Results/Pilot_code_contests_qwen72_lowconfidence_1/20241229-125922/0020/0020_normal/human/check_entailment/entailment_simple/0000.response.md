Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Function Definition Mismatch**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined with three parameters (`num`, `b`, `numerals`), but it is called with only two parameters (`n`, `base`). This will result in a `TypeError` because the third parameter (`numerals`) is missing.

2. **Incorrect Conversion Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to convert a number to a string representation in a given base. However, the implementation is flawed. The recursive call should pass `num // b` and `b` as arguments, but it currently only passes `num // b`. Additionally, the `numerals` parameter is not being used correctly.

3. **Base-10 Handling**:
   - When the base is 10, the program correctly outputs the numbers without conversion. However, for bases other than 10, the conversion function `func_1` is not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect output.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program does not ensure that the output is formatted correctly for bases other than 10. The conversion function should handle the conversion properly and ensure that the output is in the correct base.

Here is a corrected version of the program that meets the problem description:

```python
import sys

def convert_to_base(num, base):
    if num == 0:
        return '0'
    numerals = '0123456789'
    result = ''
    while num > 0:
        result = numerals[num % base] + result
        num //= base
    return result

base = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = convert_to_base(n, base)
        sys.stdout.write('%s' % n)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Convert to Base Function**:
   - The `convert_to_base` function correctly converts a number to its string representation in the specified base.
   - It handles the case where `num` is 0 by returning '0'.
   - It uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by the base and prepend the remainder to the result string.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the base from standard input.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `base - 1` for both rows and columns.
   - For each cell, it calculates the product `i * j`.
   - If the base is not 10, it converts the product to the correct base using `convert_to_base`.
   - It writes the result to standard output with appropriate spacing.

This corrected program ensures that the output matches the problem description for all valid inputs.
