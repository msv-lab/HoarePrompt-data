You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya studies positional notations. He has already learned to add and subtract numbers in the systems of notations with different radices and has moved on to a more complicated action — multiplication. To multiply large numbers one has to learn the multiplication table. Unfortunately, in the second grade students learn only the multiplication table of decimals (and some students even learn it in the first grade). Help Petya make a multiplication table for numbers in the system of notations with the radix k.

Input

The first line contains a single integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the radix of the system.

Output

Output the multiplication table for the system of notations with the radix k. The table must contain k - 1 rows and k - 1 columns. The element on the crossing of the i-th row and the j-th column is equal to the product of i and j in the system of notations with the radix k. Each line may have any number of spaces between the numbers (the extra spaces in the samples are put for clarity).

Program:
```
import sys

base = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = int(func_1(n, base))
        sys.stdout.write('%d' % n)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

def func_1(num, b, numerals='0123456789'):
    return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]


```
Output hints: The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` to its string representation in a specified base `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10) using the provided `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the function returns '0'. For non-zero `num`, the function recursively constructs the string by repeatedly dividing `num` by `b` and appending the corresponding symbol from `numerals` based on the remainder of `num % b`. However, the current implementation has a flaw: it does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. Additionally, the function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
