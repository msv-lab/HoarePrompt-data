Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from fully meeting the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Handling of Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is intended to convert a number to a specified base. However, there is a logical error in the recursive call within `func_1`. Specifically, the recursive call `func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0')` should be `func_1(num // b, b, numerals).lstrip('0')` to ensure that the `numerals` parameter is passed correctly. This oversight can lead to incorrect conversions, especially for larger numbers.

2. **Leading Zeros Issue**: The function `func_1` does not handle leading zeros correctly. For example, converting the number 0 in any base should return '0', but the current implementation can return an empty string due to the `.lstrip('0')` call.

3. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that the multiplication table should have `k-1` rows and `k-1` columns. However, the current implementation writes an extra space before each number except the first one in each row. This can lead to inconsistent spacing in the output, which does not match the required format.

4. **Base 10 Handling**: The code checks if `base != 10` to decide whether to convert the product to the specified base. However, this check is unnecessary because the conversion function `func_1` can handle base 10 correctly. The check can be removed to simplify the code and avoid potential bugs.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
