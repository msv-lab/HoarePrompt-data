Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the conversion of numbers to the specified base correctly for bases other than 10. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to convert a number to a string representation in a given base, but the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly handle the conversion process, especially for numbers that require multiple digits in the target base. For example, when `base = 3` and `i = 2`, `j = 2`, the product `n = 4` should be converted to `'11'` in base 3, but the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce the correct result. This leads to incorrect output in the multiplication table for bases other than 10.
