Final: **False**

Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the conversion of numbers to the specified base correctly in all cases, particularly for bases other than 10. The function `func_1` is supposed to convert a number from decimal to the specified base, but it is only called for bases other than 10. This means that for base 10, the numbers are not converted to their base 10 representation, which is still required according to the problem description.

For example, for the input `3`, the expected output is:
```
1  2
2 11
```
However, the current implementation will output:
```
1  2
2  4
```
This is incorrect because `4` in base 3 should be represented as `11`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is only called for bases other than 10:
```python
if base != 10:
    n = int(func_1(n, base))
```
This means that for base 10, the numbers are not converted to their base 10 representation, leading to incorrect output. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for at least one input, making it incorrect.
