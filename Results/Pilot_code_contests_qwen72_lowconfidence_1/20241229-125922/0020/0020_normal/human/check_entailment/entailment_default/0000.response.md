Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for every potential case according to the problem description:

1. **Handling of Base 10**: The code unnecessarily converts the product to a string representation in the specified base even when the base is 10. This is redundant because the problem description specifies that for base 10, the output should be in decimal format without any conversion. The line `if base != 10:` should be removed to avoid unnecessary conversions.

2. **Incorrect Conversion Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to convert a number to a string representation in a given base. However, it has a logical issue in the recursive call:
   - The line `func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0')` can lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion because it does not properly handle the base case and can result in leading zeros not being stripped correctly. This can lead to incorrect conversions, especially for larger numbers.

3. **Output Formatting**: The problem description specifies that each line may have any number of spaces between the numbers, but the current implementation writes a single space between numbers. This is not a critical issue, but it should be noted that the output format is strictly adhered to.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, particularly for bases other than 10 and for large products that may be incorrectly converted due to the flawed `func_1` function. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
