Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of numbers to the specified base correctly in all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to convert a number from decimal to the specified base, but it is not called for base 10, which is incorrect because the problem description requires the output to be in the specified base for all cases, including base 10. 

For example, for the input `3`, the output should be:
```
1  2
2 11
```
However, the current implementation will output:
```
1  2
2  4
```
This is incorrect because `4` in base 3 should be represented as `11`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for at least one input, making it incorrect.
