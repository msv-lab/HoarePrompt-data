You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya studies positional notations. He has already learned to add and subtract numbers in the systems of notations with different radices and has moved on to a more complicated action — multiplication. To multiply large numbers one has to learn the multiplication table. Unfortunately, in the second grade students learn only the multiplication table of decimals (and some students even learn it in the first grade). Help Petya make a multiplication table for numbers in the system of notations with the radix k.

Input

The first line contains a single integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 10) — the radix of the system.

Output

Output the multiplication table for the system of notations with the radix k. The table must contain k - 1 rows and k - 1 columns. The element on the crossing of the i-th row and the j-th column is equal to the product of i and j in the system of notations with the radix k. Each line may have any number of spaces between the numbers (the extra spaces in the samples are put for clarity).

Program:
```
import sys

base = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = int(func_1(n, base))
        sys.stdout.write('%d' % n)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

def func_1(num, b, numerals='0123456789'):
    return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the conversion of numbers to the specified base correctly for bases other than 10. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to convert a number to a string representation in a given base, but the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly handle the conversion process, especially for numbers that require multiple digits in the target base. For example, when `base = 3` and `i = 2`, `j = 2`, the product `n = 4` should be converted to `'11'` in base 3, but the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce the correct result. This leads to incorrect output in the multiplication table for bases other than 10.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

base = int(sys.stdin.readline())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = int(func_1(n, base))
        sys.stdout.write('%d' % n)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer representing the number to be converted, b is an integer representing the base (radix) of the numeral system where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10, and numerals is a string containing the symbols used to represent the digits in the numeral system, defaulting to '0123456789'.
def func_1(num, b, numerals):
    return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]
    #The program returns a string representation of `num` in base `b`, constructed by recursively calling `func_1` with `num // b` and concatenating the remainder of `num % b` using the `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the program returns '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` converts an integer `num` to its string representation in a specified base `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10) using the provided `numerals` string. If `num` is 0, the function returns '0'. For non-zero `num`, the function recursively constructs the string by repeatedly dividing `num` by `b` and appending the corresponding symbol from `numerals` based on the remainder of `num % b`. However, the current implementation has a flaw: it does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. Additionally, the function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
