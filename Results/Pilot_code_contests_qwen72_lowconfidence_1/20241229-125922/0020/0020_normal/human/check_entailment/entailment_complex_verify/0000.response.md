Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the `func_1` function, which is responsible for converting a number to a string representation in a given base. The function's current implementation does not correctly handle the conversion process, especially for numbers that require multiple digits in the target base. This leads to incorrect output in the multiplication table for bases other than 10.

The annotated version of the code confirms this issue:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to convert an integer `num` to its string representation in a specified base `b` using the provided `numerals` string.
- The function recursively constructs the string by repeatedly dividing `num` by `b` and appending the corresponding symbol from `numerals` based on the remainder of `num % b`.
- However, the function does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion.
- Additionally, the function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string.

For example, when `base = 3` and `i = 2`, `j = 2`, the product `n = 4` should be converted to `'11'` in base 3. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce the correct result, leading to incorrect output in the multiplication table.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
