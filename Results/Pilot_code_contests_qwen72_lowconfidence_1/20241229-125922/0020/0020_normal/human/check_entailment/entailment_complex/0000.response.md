Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Conversion**: The function `func_1` is intended to convert a number to a string representation in a given base. However, there is a logical error in the recursive call:
   ```python
   return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]
   ```
   The recursive call should pass the base `b` and the `numerals` string to itself:
   ```python
   return num == 0 and '0' or func_1(num // b, b, numerals).lstrip('0') + numerals[num % b]
   ```
   Without passing `b` and `numerals` in the recursive call, the function will not work correctly.

2. **Incorrect Base Conversion for Non-Decimal Bases**: The program attempts to convert the product `n` to the specified base `base` using `func_1` for bases other than 10. However, due to the issue mentioned above, the conversion is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Output Formatting**: The problem description requires that the output should be formatted such that each row contains `k-1` elements, and each element is separated by spaces. The current implementation does not ensure consistent spacing, which might lead to incorrect formatting.

4. **Logical Error in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` has a logical error in the base case and recursive call, which can lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly handle the base conversion and ensure proper formatting of the output. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(num, b, numerals='0123456789'):
    if num == 0:
        return '0'
    result = ''
    while num > 0:
        result = numerals[num % b] + result
        num //= b
    return result

base = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
for i in range(1, base):
    for j in range(1, base):
        if j != 1:
            sys.stdout.write(' ')
        n = i * j
        if base != 10:
            n = func_1(n, base)
        sys.stdout.write('%s' % n)
    sys.stdout.write('\n')
```

In this corrected version:
- The `func_1` function correctly converts a number to a string representation in the specified base.
- The output formatting ensures that each row contains `k-1` elements, and each element is separated by spaces.

With these corrections, the program will meet the requirements of the problem description.
