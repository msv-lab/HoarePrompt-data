Final: **False**

Reasoning:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the conversion of numbers to the specified base correctly in all cases.
- Specifically, the function `func_1` is not called for base 10, which is incorrect because the problem description requires the output to be in the specified base for all cases, including base 10.
- For example, for the input `3`, the expected output is:
  ```
  1  2
  2 11
  ```
  However, the current implementation outputs:
  ```
  1  2
  2  4
  ```
  This is incorrect because `4` in base 3 should be represented as `11`.
- The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` has flaws, such as not handling negative values and potentially leading to incorrect results or infinite recursion. However, the main issue here is the failure to convert numbers to the specified base correctly, especially for base 10.
- Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect based on the problem description and the provided code.
