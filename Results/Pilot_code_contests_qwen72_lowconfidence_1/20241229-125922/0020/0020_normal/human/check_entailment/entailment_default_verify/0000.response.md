Final: **False**

Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The key issues identified in the original assessment are:

1. **Incorrect Conversion to Base:** The function `func_1` is responsible for converting a number to its string representation in a specified base. The output hints confirm that `func_1` has a flaw in its implementation, particularly in handling the conversion process for numbers that require multiple digits in the target base. This leads to incorrect results in the multiplication table for bases other than 10.

2. **Recursive Logic Flaw:** The output hints also point out that the function does not handle negative values of `num` and may lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. Although the problem description guarantees that the input will be valid and within the specified range (2 ≤ k ≤ 10), the function's incorrect handling of the conversion process still affects the correctness of the output.

3. **Leading Zeros Issue:** The function does not strip leading zeros correctly in the recursive calls, which can result in extra leading zeros in the final string. This further contributes to the incorrect output in the multiplication table.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for generating a correct multiplication table for numbers in the system of notations with the radix k. Therefore, the final assessment remains **False**.
