You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is <image>. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.

Input

The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, where mi (0 ≤ mi ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, where wi (0 ≤ wi ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.

The last line contains two space-separated integers hs and hu (0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.

Examples

Input

20 40 60 80 100
0 1 2 3 4
1 0


Output

4900


Input

119 119 119 119 119
0 0 0 0 0
10 0


Output

4930

Note

In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <image> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <image>. Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.
Program:
```
def func():
    m = raw_input().split(' ')
    w = raw_input().split(' ')
    h = raw_input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = int(m[i])
        w1 = int(w[i])
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans = ans + pts
    ans = ans + 100 * int(h[0])
    ans = ans - 50 * int(h[1])
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the division operation correctly in Python 2, which uses integer division by default when dividing two integers. This can lead to incorrect results in the calculation of `pts`. Specifically, the expression `(1 - m1 / 250) * x` will result in an integer division, truncating the decimal part, which can cause significant errors in the score calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
120 120 120 120 120
0 0 0 0 0
0 0
```
Here, `m1 / 250` will always be `0` because `120 / 250` is less than 1, and integer division truncates the result to `0`. This means the score for each problem will be calculated as `x`, which is incorrect because the actual score should be `0.3 * x` since `m1` is 120.

To fix this issue, the division should be performed using floating-point arithmetic, which can be achieved by converting one of the operands to a float:
```python
pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - float(m1) / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
```

This ensures that the division is performed correctly, and the program will produce the expected results for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` should take three parameters: `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`. `submission_times` is a list of five integers representing the times (in minutes) of Kevin's last correct submissions for each problem, where 0 ≤ mi ≤ 119. `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers representing the number of wrong submissions Kevin made on each problem, where 0 ≤ wi ≤ 10. `hacks` is a tuple of two integers (hs, hu) representing the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively, where 0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20.
def func():
    m = raw_input().split(' ')
    w = raw_input().split(' ')
    h = raw_input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        
        m1 = int(m[i])
        
        w1 = int(w[i])
        
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        
        ans = ans + pts
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 4, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, where `m1` and `w1` are the integer values of the corresponding elements in `m` and `w`.
    ans = ans + 100 * int(h[0])
    ans = ans - 50 * int(h[1])
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads three lines of space-separated inputs from the user, interpreting them as lists of integers. The first input is treated as the `submission_times` for five problems, the second as the `wrong_submissions` for those problems, and the third as a tuple `hacks` containing the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. It calculates a score based on these inputs, applying specific scoring rules to each problem and adjusting the total score based on the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. The final score is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of elements), which would cause the function to raise a `ValueError`. The function assumes the input is always valid and does not handle such errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
