You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is <image>. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.

Input

The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, where mi (0 ≤ mi ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, where wi (0 ≤ wi ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.

The last line contains two space-separated integers hs and hu (0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.

Examples

Input

20 40 60 80 100
0 1 2 3 4
1 0


Output

4900


Input

119 119 119 119 119
0 0 0 0 0
10 0


Output

4930

Note

In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <image> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <image>. Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.
Program:
```
def func():
    m = raw_input().split(' ')
    w = raw_input().split(' ')
    h = raw_input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = int(m[i])
        w1 = int(w[i])
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans = ans + pts
    ans = ans + 100 * int(h[0])
    ans = ans - 50 * int(h[1])
    print(ans)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
