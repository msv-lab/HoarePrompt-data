Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the scoring formula correctly according to the problem description. Specifically, the calculation of the points for each problem should use the formula:

\[ \text{points} = \max(0.3 \times x, (1 - \frac{m}{250}) \times x - 50 \times w) \]

However, the code incorrectly performs integer division when calculating the score, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, the expression `m1 / 250` performs integer division in Python 2, which truncates the result. This can cause the score to be calculated incorrectly, especially when `m1` is small.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the score for a problem could be less than 0.3 * x due to the way the formula is applied. The formula ensures that the score is never less than 30% of the maximum points, but the current implementation does not enforce this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code to illustrate the issue:

```python
def func():
    m = raw_input().split(' ')
    w = raw_input().split(' ')
    h = raw_input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = int(m[i])
        w1 = int(w[i])
        # Corrected calculation using float division
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250.0) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans += pts
    ans += 100 * int(h[0])
    ans -= 50 * int(h[1])
    print(ans)
```

This correction ensures that the division is performed as a floating-point operation, and the score is correctly calculated according to the problem description. Without this correction, the program will produce incorrect results for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
