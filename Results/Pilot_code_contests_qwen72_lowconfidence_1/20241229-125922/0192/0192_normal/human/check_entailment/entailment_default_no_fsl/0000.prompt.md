You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Kevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.

Codeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is <image>. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

All arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.

Input

The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, where mi (0 ≤ mi ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.

The second line contains five space-separated integers w1, w2, w3, w4, w5, where wi (0 ≤ wi ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.

The last line contains two space-separated integers hs and hu (0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.

Output

Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.

Examples

Input

20 40 60 80 100
0 1 2 3 4
1 0


Output

4900


Input

119 119 119 119 119
0 0 0 0 0
10 0


Output

4930

Note

In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets <image> of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is <image>. Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.
Program:
```
def func():
    m = raw_input().split(' ')
    w = raw_input().split(' ')
    h = raw_input().split(' ')
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = int(m[i])
        w1 = int(w[i])
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans = ans + pts
    ans = ans + 100 * int(h[0])
    ans = ans - 50 * int(h[1])
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads three lines of space-separated inputs from the user, interpreting them as lists of integers. The first input is treated as the `submission_times` for five problems, the second as the `wrong_submissions` for those problems, and the third as a tuple `hacks` containing the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. It calculates a score based on these inputs, applying specific scoring rules to each problem and adjusting the total score based on the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks. The final score is printed to the console. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect number of elements), which would cause the function to raise a `ValueError`. The function assumes the input is always valid and does not handle such errors.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
