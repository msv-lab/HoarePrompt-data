Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a critical issue in how it calculates the score for each problem. Specifically, the calculation `(1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1` uses integer division, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, when `m1` is 119, `m1 / 250` evaluates to 0 (since integer division truncates the decimal part), leading to an incorrect score calculation. This is a significant deviation from the problem description, which requires precise floating-point arithmetic.

To fix this, the division should be performed using floating-point arithmetic. Here is the corrected version of the relevant line:

```python
pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250.0) * x - 50 * w1)
```

This ensures that the division is performed correctly, and the score is calculated as intended. Without this correction, the program will not produce the correct output for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
