Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` should take three parameters: `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`. However, the provided program reads input directly from the user using `raw_input()` instead of taking these parameters as arguments. This means the function signature does not match the problem description.

2. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the score for each problem is:
     \[
     \text{pts} = \max\left(0.3 \times x, \left(1 - \frac{m1}{250}\right) \times x - 50 \times w1\right)
     \]
   - The program correctly implements this formula, but it does not handle the case where the result of the formula might not be an integer. The problem description guarantees that Kevin's final score is an integer, so the program should ensure that the final score is indeed an integer.

3. **Hack Points**:
   - The program correctly adds 100 points for each successful hack and subtracts 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final score, which is correct according to the problem description.

### Summary:
- **Function Signature**: The function should take parameters instead of reading from `raw_input()`.
- **Integer Score**: The program should ensure that the final score is an integer, as guaranteed by the problem description.

To make the program correct, it should be modified to take the required parameters and ensure that the final score is an integer. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func(submission_times, wrong_submissions, hacks):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = submission_times[i]
        w1 = wrong_submissions[i]
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans += pts
    
    ans += 100 * hacks[0]
    ans -= 50 * hacks[1]
    print(int(ans))
```

This version of the function adheres to the problem description and ensures that the final score is an integer.
