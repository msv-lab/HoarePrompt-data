Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The program provided does not fully adhere to the problem description due to the following issues:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling**: The function `func()` is designed to read input directly from `raw_input()`, but according to the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`. The function should not rely on user input during its execution but instead process the provided parameters.

2. **Scoring Calculation**: The scoring formula used in the program is mostly correct, but there is a subtle issue with the way the division is handled. In Python 2, the division operator `/` performs integer division when both operands are integers, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, `m1 / 250` should be a floating-point division to ensure the correct calculation of the score. In Python 3, this would be `m1 / 250.0` or `m1 / 250` (since Python 3 performs true division by default).

3. **Final Score Adjustment**: The adjustment for successful and unsuccessful hacks is correctly implemented in the program.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final score, which is consistent with the problem description.

To make the program correct, it should be modified to accept parameters as described in the problem statement and ensure that the division is handled correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func(submission_times, wrong_submissions, hacks):
    ans = 0
    for i in range(5):
        x = 500 * (i + 1)
        m1 = submission_times[i]
        w1 = wrong_submissions[i]
        pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250.0) * x - 50 * w1)
        ans += pts
    
    ans += 100 * hacks[0]
    ans -= 50 * hacks[1]
    print(ans)

# Example usage:
submission_times = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
wrong_submissions = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
hacks = (1, 0)
func(submission_times, wrong_submissions, hacks)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly compute Kevin's final score according to the problem description.
