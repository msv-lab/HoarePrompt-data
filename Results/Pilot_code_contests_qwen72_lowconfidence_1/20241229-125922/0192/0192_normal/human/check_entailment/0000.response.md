Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the division operation correctly in Python 2, which uses integer division by default when dividing two integers. This can lead to incorrect results in the calculation of `pts`. Specifically, the expression `(1 - m1 / 250) * x` will result in an integer division, truncating the decimal part, which can cause significant errors in the score calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
120 120 120 120 120
0 0 0 0 0
0 0
```
Here, `m1 / 250` will always be `0` because `120 / 250` is less than 1, and integer division truncates the result to `0`. This means the score for each problem will be calculated as `x`, which is incorrect because the actual score should be `0.3 * x` since `m1` is 120.

To fix this issue, the division should be performed using floating-point arithmetic, which can be achieved by converting one of the operands to a float:
```python
pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - float(m1) / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
```

This ensures that the division is performed correctly, and the program will produce the expected results for all potential cases.
