Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has an issue with the calculation of the points for each problem. Specifically, the expression `(1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1` is using integer division for `m1 / 250`, which can lead to incorrect results in Python 2 (since `raw_input` suggests Python 2). Integer division in Python 2 truncates the decimal part, which can cause the score calculation to be incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
120 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0
```

The program should handle this case correctly, but because `120 / 250` results in `0` (integer division), the score for the first problem will be calculated as:
```
max(0.3 * 500, (1 - 0) * 500 - 50 * 0) = max(150, 500) = 500
```
However, the correct score should be:
```
max(0.3 * 500, (1 - 120 / 250.0) * 500 - 50 * 0) = max(150, (1 - 0.48) * 500) = max(150, 0.52 * 500) = max(150, 260) = 260
```

To fix this, the division should be done using floating-point arithmetic:
```python
pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250.0) * x - 50 * w1)
```

This ensures that the division is performed correctly and the score calculation is accurate.
