The function `func` should take three parameters: `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`. `submission_times` is a list of five integers representing the times (in minutes) of Kevin's last correct submissions for each problem, where 0 ≤ mi ≤ 119. `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers representing the number of wrong submissions Kevin made on each problem, where 0 ≤ wi ≤ 10. `hacks` is a tuple of two integers (hs, hu) representing the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively, where 0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20.
