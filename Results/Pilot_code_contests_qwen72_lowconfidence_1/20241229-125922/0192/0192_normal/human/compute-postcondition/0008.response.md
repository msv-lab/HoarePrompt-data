To determine the output state, let's evaluate the given code snippet:

```
pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `submission_times` is a list of five integers
   - `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers
   - `hacks` is a tuple of two integers
   - `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
   - `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
   - `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
   - `ans` is 0
   - `x` is 500
   - `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`
   - `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`

2. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - Calculate `0.3 * x`:
     \[
     0.3 \times 500 = 150
     \]
   - Calculate `(1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1`:
     \[
     (1 - \frac{m1}{250}) \times 500 - 50 \times w1
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     500 - 2 \times m1 - 50 \times w1
     \]

3. **Determine `pts`:**
   - `pts` is the maximum of `150` and `500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1`.

### Output State:

- `pts` is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{pts} = \max(150, 500 - 2 \times m1 - 50 \times w1)
  \]

- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is 0, `x` is 500, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`, `pts` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`**
