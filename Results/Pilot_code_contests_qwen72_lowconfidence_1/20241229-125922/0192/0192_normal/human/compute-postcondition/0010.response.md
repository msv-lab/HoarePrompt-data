To determine the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The loop iterates over a fixed range from 0 to 4 (inclusive), meaning it will run exactly 5 times.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that this was the first iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(5):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
- The other variables (`submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, `hacks`, `m`, `w`, `h`, `ans`, `x`, `m1`, `w1`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop itself based on the information provided.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 500, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`**
