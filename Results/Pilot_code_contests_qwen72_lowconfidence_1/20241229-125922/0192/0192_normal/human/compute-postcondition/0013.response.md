The value of `w1` is updated to the integer value of the element at index `i` in the list `w`. Given that `i` is 1, `w1` is now the integer value of the second element in the list `w`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1000, `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`**
