The code snippet provided updates the value of `pts` using the formula `pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)`. Given the initial state, let's calculate the new value of `pts`:

- `x` is 1500
- `m1` is `int(m[2])`
- `w1` is `int(w[2])`

The formula for `pts` is:
\[ \text{pts} = \max(0.3 \times x, (1 - \frac{m1}{250}) \times x - 50 \times w1) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{pts} = \max(0.3 \times 1500, (1 - \frac{m1}{250}) \times 1500 - 50 \times w1) \]
\[ \text{pts} = \max(450, (1 - \frac{m1}{250}) \times 1500 - 50 \times w1) \]

Let's break down the second part of the `max` function:
\[ (1 - \frac{m1}{250}) \times 1500 - 50 \times w1 \]
\[ = 1500 - \frac{1500 \times m1}{250} - 50 \times w1 \]
\[ = 1500 - 6 \times m1 - 50 \times w1 \]

So, the formula for `pts` becomes:
\[ \text{pts} = \max(450, 1500 - 6 \times m1 - 50 \times w1) \]

The updated value of `pts` is calculated based on this formula. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1500, `m1` is `int(m[2])`, `w1` is `int(w[2])`, `pts` is `max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`**
