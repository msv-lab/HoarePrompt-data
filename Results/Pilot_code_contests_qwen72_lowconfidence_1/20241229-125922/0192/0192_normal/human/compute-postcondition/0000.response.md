The line of code `m = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `m`. This operation does not affect the initial state of the function parameters `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`.

Output State: **`submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.**
