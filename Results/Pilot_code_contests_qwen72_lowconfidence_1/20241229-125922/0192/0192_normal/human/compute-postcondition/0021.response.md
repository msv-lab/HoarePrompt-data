The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `pts` to it. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- `ans` is initially calculated as `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`.
- `pts` is calculated as `max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`.
- The new value of `ans` becomes `ans + pts`.

Since `m1` and `w1` are derived from the lists `m` and `w` which are obtained by splitting user inputs, their values are not specified in the initial state. However, the calculations for `ans` and `pts` depend on these values.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `submission_times` is a list of five integers
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`
- `x` is 1500
- `m1` is `int(m[2])`
- `w1` is `int(w[2])`
- `pts` is `max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + pts`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1) + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1500, `m1` is `int(m[2])`, `w1` is `int(w[2])`, `pts` is `max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`**.
