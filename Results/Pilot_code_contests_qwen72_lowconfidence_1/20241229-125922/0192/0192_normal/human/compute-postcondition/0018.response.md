The code snippet `m1 = int(m[i])` updates the value of `m1` by converting the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the list `m` to an integer.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces

The new value of `m1` is determined by the third element of `m` (since `i` is 2), converted to an integer.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is 2
- `submission_times` is a list of five integers
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`
- `x` is 1500
- `m1` is `int(m[2])`
- `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`
- `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`

Output State: **`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1500, `m1` is `int(m[2])`, `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`, `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`**
