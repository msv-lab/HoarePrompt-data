The code snippet `m1 = int(m[i])` impacts the variable `m1` by converting the value of `m` at index `i` to an integer and assigning it to `m1`.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `m1` is assigned the integer value of the element in `m` at index `i`.
2. Since `i` is 1, `m1` will be the integer value of the second element in the list `m`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1000, `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`**
