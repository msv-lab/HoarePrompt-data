The code `w1 = int(w[i])` updates the value of `w1` based on the third element (index 2) of the list `w`. Since `i` is 2, `w1` will be set to the integer value of `w[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1500, `m1` is `int(m[2])`, `w1` is `int(w[2])`, `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`**
