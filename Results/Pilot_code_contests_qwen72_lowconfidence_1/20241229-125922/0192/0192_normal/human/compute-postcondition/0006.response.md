The code snippet `m1 = int(m[i])` converts the first element of the list `m` (since `i` is 0) into an integer and assigns it to the variable `m1`.

- `i` remains 0.
- `submission_times` and `wrong_submissions` remain as lists of five integers.
- `hacks` remains as a tuple of two integers.
- `w` and `h` remain as lists of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `x` remains 500.
- `m1` is now an integer equal to the first element of `m` converted to an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is 0, `x` is 500, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`.**
