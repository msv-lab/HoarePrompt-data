The value of `i` is 0. The code assigns `x` the value `500 * (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `x` becomes `500 * (0 + 1)`, which is 500. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is 0, `x` is 500**
