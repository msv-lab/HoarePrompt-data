The code `h = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This means that `h` will now contain this new list.

- `submission_times` remains a list of five integers.
- `wrong_submissions` remains a list of five integers.
- `hacks` remains a tuple of two integers.
- `m` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `w` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `h` is now a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.

Output State: **`submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.**
