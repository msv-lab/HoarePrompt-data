The code snippet calculates the value of `pts` using the formula `max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `x` is given as 1000.
2. `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`.
3. `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`.

The formula for `pts` is:
- `0.3 * x` is `0.3 * 1000 = 300`.
- `(1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1` is calculated as follows:
  - `1 - m1 / 250` is `1 - (m1 / 250)`.
  - Multiplying this by `x` gives `(1 - m1 / 250) * 1000`.
  - Subtracting `50 * w1` from this gives `(1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1`.

Finally, `pts` is set to the maximum of these two values.

Let's assume `m1` and `w1` are specific values for the calculation. For example, let's say `m1` is 50 and `w1` is 10 (since these are not provided, we use these as examples):

- `0.3 * 1000 = 300`.
- `(1 - 50 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * 10`:
  - `1 - 50 / 250 = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8`.
  - `0.8 * 1000 = 800`.
  - `800 - 50 * 10 = 800 - 500 = 300`.

Thus, `pts` is `max(300, 300) = 300`.

Since the values of `m1` and `w1` are not provided, the exact value of `pts` depends on the actual values of `m1` and `w1`.
