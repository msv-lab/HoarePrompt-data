The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `pts` to its current value. We need to evaluate the expressions for `ans` and `pts` based on the given initial state.

- `ans` is defined as `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`.
- `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`.
- `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`.
- `pts` is defined as `max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)`.

Given that `x` is 1000, we can substitute this value into the expressions for `ans` and `pts`.

1. Calculate `ans`:
   - `ans = max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
   - This depends on the values of `m1` and `w1`.

2. Calculate `pts`:
   - `pts = max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`
   - Simplifying: `pts = max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`

3. Update `ans`:
   - `ans = ans + pts`
   - Substitute the values of `ans` and `pts` from the above calculations.

Since the exact values of `m1` and `w1` are not provided, we can express the updated `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1000, `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`, `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`**
