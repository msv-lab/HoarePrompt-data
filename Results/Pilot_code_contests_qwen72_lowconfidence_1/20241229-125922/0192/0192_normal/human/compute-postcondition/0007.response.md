The code snippet `w1 = int(w[i])` converts the first element of the list `w` (since `i` is 0) into an integer and assigns it to the variable `w1`.

- `i` remains 0.
- `submission_times` remains as a list of five integers.
- `wrong_submissions` remains as a list of five integers.
- `hacks` remains as a tuple of two integers.
- `m` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `w` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `h` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `x` remains 500.
- `m1` remains the integer value of the first element of `m`.
- `w1` is now an integer equal to the first element of `w` converted to an integer.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is 0, `x` is 500, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`.**
