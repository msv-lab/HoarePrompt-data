The code updates the value of `ans` by adding 100 times the integer value of the first element in the list `h`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1) + 100 * int(h[0])`, where `m1` and `w1` are the integer values of the corresponding elements in `m` and `w`.**
