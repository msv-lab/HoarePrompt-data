The function `func` accepts three parameters: `submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, and `hacks`.

- `submission_times` is a list of five integers, each representing the time (in minutes) of Kevin's last correct submission for each problem, where 0 ≤ mi ≤ 119.
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, each representing the number of wrong submissions Kevin made on each problem, where 0 ≤ wi ≤ 10.
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers (hs, hu), representing the number of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively, where 0 ≤ hs, hu ≤ 20.

The function does not provide a specific output in the given context. However, based on typical behavior, the function might perform some calculation or logic using these parameters and return a result. Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters and leave the return value open-ended.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `submission_times` (a list of five integers representing submission times), `wrong_submissions` (a list of five integers representing wrong submissions), and `hacks` (a tuple of two integers representing successful and unsuccessful hacks). The function's return value is not specified.**
