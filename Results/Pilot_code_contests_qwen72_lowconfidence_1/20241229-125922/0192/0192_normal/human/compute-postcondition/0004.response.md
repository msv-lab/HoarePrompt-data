To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range function generates a sequence of numbers. In this case, `range(5)` will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which means the loop will execute 5 times.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `submission_times` is a list of five integers.
   - `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers.
   - `hacks` is a tuple of two integers.
   - `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
   - `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
   - `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
   - `ans` is 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute 5 times, so `i` should start at 0 and go up to 4.
   - The lists `submission_times` and `wrong_submissions` must each contain exactly 5 elements for the loop to be meaningful in the context of these lists.
   - The variable `ans` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution but is part of the initial state.
   - The lists `m`, `w`, and `h` are derived from user input and do not directly affect the loop execution, but they should be valid lists (not necessarily containing any specific number of elements).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 0.
- `submission_times` is a list of five integers.
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers.
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers.
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `ans` is 0.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is 0**
