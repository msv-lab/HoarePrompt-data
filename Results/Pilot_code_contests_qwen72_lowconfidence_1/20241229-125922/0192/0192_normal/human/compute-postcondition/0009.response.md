The code snippet `ans = ans + pts` updates the value of `ans` by adding `pts` to its current value. Given the initial state, let's determine the new value of `ans`:

- `ans` initially is 0.
- `pts` is calculated as `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`.
- `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`.
- `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`.

Since the exact values of `m1` and `w1` are not provided, we can only express the calculation in terms of these variables. The value of `pts` will be the maximum of 150 and the result of the expression `500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `ans` will be the value of `pts`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 500, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`**.
