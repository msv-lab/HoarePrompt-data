The code `x = 500 * (i + 1)` updates the value of `x` based on the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation for `x` is:

\[ x = 500 * (2 + 1) = 500 * 3 = 1500 \]

Therefore, the new value of `x` is 1500. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1500, `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`, `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`**
