The code snippet `w = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This updates the variable `w` with the resulting list. The other variables (`submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, `hacks`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.**
