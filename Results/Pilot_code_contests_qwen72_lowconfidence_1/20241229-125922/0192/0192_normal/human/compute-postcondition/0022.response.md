To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior over all five iterations. Let's break down the process step by step:

### Initial State:
- `submission_times` is a list of five integers.
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers.
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers.
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `ans` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(5):
    x = 500 * (i + 1)
    m1 = int(m[i])
    w1 = int(w[i])
    pts = max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)
    ans = ans + pts
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs exactly 5 times because `range(5)` generates the indices `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- For each iteration `i`, `x` is calculated as `500 * (i + 1)`.
- `m1` and `w1` are the integer values of the `i`-th elements of `m` and `w`, respectively.
- `pts` is calculated as `max(0.3 * x, (1 - m1 / 250) * x - 50 * w1)`.
- `ans` is updated by adding `pts` to its current value.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be 4 (the last index of the loop).
- `submission_times` remains a list of five integers.
- `wrong_submissions` remains a list of five integers.
- `hacks` remains a tuple of two integers.
- `m` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `w` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `h` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces.
- `ans` will be the sum of `pts` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = 4`.

### Detailed Calculation of `ans`:
- For `i = 0`:
  - `x = 500 * (0 + 1) = 500`
  - `m1 = int(m[0])`
  - `w1 = int(w[0])`
  - `pts = max(0.3 * 500, (1 - m1 / 250) * 500 - 50 * w1) = max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
  - `ans = 0 + max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

- For `i = 1`:
  - `x = 500 * (1 + 1) = 1000`
  - `m1 = int(m[1])`
  - `w1 = int(w[1])`
  - `pts = max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1) = max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
  - `ans = ans + max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

- For `i = 2`:
  - `x = 500 * (2 + 1) = 1500`
  - `m1 = int(m[2])`
  - `w1 = int(w[2])`
  - `pts = max(0.3 * 1500, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1500 - 50 * w1) = max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
  - `ans = ans + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

- For `i = 3`:
  - `x = 500 * (3 + 1) = 2000`
  - `m1 = int(m[3])`
  - `w1 = int(w[3])`
  - `pts = max(0.3 * 2000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 2000 - 50 * w1) = max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
  - `ans = ans + max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

- For `i = 4`:
  - `x = 500 * (4 + 1) = 2500`
  - `m1 = int(m[4])`
  - `w1 = int(w[4])`
  - `pts = max(0.3 * 2500, (1 - m1 / 250) * 2500 - 50 * w1) = max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1)`
  - `ans = ans + max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1)`

### Final Output State:
**`i` is 4, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, where `m1` and `w1` are the integer values of the corresponding elements in `m` and `w`.**
