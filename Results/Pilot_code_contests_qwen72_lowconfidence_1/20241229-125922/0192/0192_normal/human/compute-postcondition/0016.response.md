To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `submission_times` is a list of five integers
- `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers
- `hacks` is a tuple of two integers
- `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces
- `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`
- `x` is 1000
- `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`
- `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`
- `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(5):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to 4 (inclusive), meaning it will run 5 times.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 5.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- All other variables (`submission_times`, `wrong_submissions`, `hacks`, `m`, `w`, `h`, `ans`, `x`, `m1`, `w1`, `pts`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop condition or by the loop itself.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - (m1 * 4) - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1000, `m1` is the integer value of the second element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the second element of `w`, `pts` is `max(0.3 * 1000, (1 - m1 / 250) * 1000 - 50 * w1)`**
