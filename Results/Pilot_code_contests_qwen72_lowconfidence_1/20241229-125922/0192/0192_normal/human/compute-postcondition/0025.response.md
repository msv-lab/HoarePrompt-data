The code snippet provided is a `print` statement that outputs the value of the variable `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined by the formula given in the initial state. This formula uses the first element of the list `m` (denoted as `m1`), the first element of the list `w` (denoted as `w1`), and the elements of the list `h`.

Since the exact values of `m1`, `w1`, and the elements of `h` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, the `print` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only displays the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional action of printing the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(300, 1000 - 4 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(450, 1500 - 6 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(600, 2000 - 8 * m1 - 50 * w1) + max(750, 2500 - 10 * m1 - 50 * w1) + 100 * int(h[0]) - 50 * int(h[1])`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
