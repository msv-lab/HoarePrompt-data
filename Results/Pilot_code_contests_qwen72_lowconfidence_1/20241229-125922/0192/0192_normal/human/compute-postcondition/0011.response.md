The value of `x` is updated to `500 * (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` becomes `500 * (1 + 1)` which equals `1000`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 1, `submission_times` is a list of five integers, `wrong_submissions` is a list of five integers, `hacks` is a tuple of two integers, `m` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `w` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `h` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the user input by spaces, `ans` is `max(150, 500 - 2 * m1 - 50 * w1)`, `x` is 1000, `m1` is the integer value of the first element of `m`, `w1` is the integer value of the first element of `w`**
