You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Cowboy Vlad has a birthday today! There are n children who came to the celebration. In order to greet Vlad, the children decided to form a circle around him. Among the children who came, there are both tall and low, so if they stand in a circle arbitrarily, it may turn out, that there is a tall and low child standing next to each other, and it will be difficult for them to hold hands. Therefore, children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible.

Formally, let's number children from 1 to n in a circle order, that is, for every i child with number i will stand next to the child with number i+1, also the child with number 1 stands next to the child with number n. Then we will call the discomfort of the circle the maximum absolute difference of heights of the children, who stand next to each other.

Please help children to find out how they should reorder themselves, so that the resulting discomfort is smallest possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) denoting heights of every child.

Output

Print exactly n integers — heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 3 2


Output


1 2 3 2 1


Input


3
30 10 20


Output


10 20 30

Note

In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 1, since the corresponding absolute differences are 1, 1, 1 and 0. Note, that sequences [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] and [3, 2, 1, 1, 2] form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point.

In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 20, since the absolute difference of 10 and 30 is equal to 20.
Program:
```
import sys
import random, math
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(__) for __ in raw_input().split()]
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    newl = list()
    fl = 0
    for el in arr:
        if fl == 0:
            newl.append(el)
            fl = 1
        else:
            newl = [el] + newl
            fl = 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in newl]))


```
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` representing the heights of `n` children. It sorts `arr` in descending order and then rearranges the elements into a new list `newl` such that the elements are placed alternately (the first element of `arr` becomes the last in `newl`, the second becomes the first, and so on). Finally, it prints the elements of `newl` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `n` being an integer within the range 2 to 100, `arr` being a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `newl` containing the elements of `arr` in the specified alternating order. The variable `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. The function does not compute or return the maximum height difference among the children as suggested by the incorrect annotation.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
