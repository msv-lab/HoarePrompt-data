You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Cowboy Vlad has a birthday today! There are n children who came to the celebration. In order to greet Vlad, the children decided to form a circle around him. Among the children who came, there are both tall and low, so if they stand in a circle arbitrarily, it may turn out, that there is a tall and low child standing next to each other, and it will be difficult for them to hold hands. Therefore, children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible.

Formally, let's number children from 1 to n in a circle order, that is, for every i child with number i will stand next to the child with number i+1, also the child with number 1 stands next to the child with number n. Then we will call the discomfort of the circle the maximum absolute difference of heights of the children, who stand next to each other.

Please help children to find out how they should reorder themselves, so that the resulting discomfort is smallest possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) denoting heights of every child.

Output

Print exactly n integers — heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 3 2


Output


1 2 3 2 1


Input


3
30 10 20


Output


10 20 30

Note

In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 1, since the corresponding absolute differences are 1, 1, 1 and 0. Note, that sequences [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] and [3, 2, 1, 1, 2] form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point.

In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 20, since the absolute difference of 10 and 30 is equal to 20.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys
import random, math
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the heights of the children.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(__) for __ in raw_input().split()]
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    newl = list()
    fl = 0
    for el in arr:
        if fl == 0:
            newl.append(el)
            fl = 1
        else:
            newl = [el] + newl
            fl = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n`, `newl` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in an alternating order (first element of `arr` is the last in `newl`, second is the first in `newl`, and so on), `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd, `el` is the last element of `arr`.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in newl]))

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
