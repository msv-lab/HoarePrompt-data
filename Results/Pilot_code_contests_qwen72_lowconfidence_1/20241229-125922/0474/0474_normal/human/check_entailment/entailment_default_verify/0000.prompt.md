You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Cowboy Vlad has a birthday today! There are n children who came to the celebration. In order to greet Vlad, the children decided to form a circle around him. Among the children who came, there are both tall and low, so if they stand in a circle arbitrarily, it may turn out, that there is a tall and low child standing next to each other, and it will be difficult for them to hold hands. Therefore, children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible.

Formally, let's number children from 1 to n in a circle order, that is, for every i child with number i will stand next to the child with number i+1, also the child with number 1 stands next to the child with number n. Then we will call the discomfort of the circle the maximum absolute difference of heights of the children, who stand next to each other.

Please help children to find out how they should reorder themselves, so that the resulting discomfort is smallest possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) denoting heights of every child.

Output

Print exactly n integers — heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 3 2


Output


1 2 3 2 1


Input


3
30 10 20


Output


10 20 30

Note

In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 1, since the corresponding absolute differences are 1, 1, 1 and 0. Note, that sequences [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] and [3, 2, 1, 1, 2] form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point.

In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 20, since the absolute difference of 10 and 30 is equal to 20.
Program:
```
import sys
import random, math
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(__) for __ in raw_input().split()]
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    newl = list()
    fl = 0
    for el in arr:
        if fl == 0:
            newl.append(el)
            fl = 1
        else:
            newl = [el] + newl
            fl = 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in newl]))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem of minimizing the maximum discomfort in a circular arrangement of children based on their heights. The approach taken is to sort the heights in descending order and then alternate placing the highest and the next highest heights in the new list. This ensures that the maximum difference between adjacent heights is minimized. The program works for the provided examples and seems to handle edge cases such as when all heights are the same or when the number of children is small. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this alternating placement strategy effectively minimizes the maximum discomfort, making the program correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` representing the heights of `n` children. It sorts `arr` in descending order and then rearranges the elements into a new list `newl` such that the elements are placed alternately (the first element of `arr` becomes the last in `newl`, the second becomes the first, and so on). Finally, it prints the elements of `newl` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `n` being an integer within the range 2 to 100, `arr` being a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `newl` containing the elements of `arr` in the specified alternating order. The variable `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. The function does not compute or return the maximum height difference among the children as suggested by the incorrect annotation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
