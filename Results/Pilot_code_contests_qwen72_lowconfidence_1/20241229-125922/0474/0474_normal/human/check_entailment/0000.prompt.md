You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Cowboy Vlad has a birthday today! There are n children who came to the celebration. In order to greet Vlad, the children decided to form a circle around him. Among the children who came, there are both tall and low, so if they stand in a circle arbitrarily, it may turn out, that there is a tall and low child standing next to each other, and it will be difficult for them to hold hands. Therefore, children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible.

Formally, let's number children from 1 to n in a circle order, that is, for every i child with number i will stand next to the child with number i+1, also the child with number 1 stands next to the child with number n. Then we will call the discomfort of the circle the maximum absolute difference of heights of the children, who stand next to each other.

Please help children to find out how they should reorder themselves, so that the resulting discomfort is smallest possible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday.

The second line contains integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) denoting heights of every child.

Output

Print exactly n integers — heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child.

If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input


5
2 1 1 3 2


Output


1 2 3 2 1


Input


3
30 10 20


Output


10 20 30

Note

In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 1, since the corresponding absolute differences are 1, 1, 1 and 0. Note, that sequences [2, 3, 2, 1, 1] and [3, 2, 1, 1, 2] form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point.

In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to 20, since the absolute difference of 10 and 30 is equal to 20.
Program:
```
import sys
import random, math
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = [int(__) for __ in raw_input().split()]
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    newl = list()
    fl = 0
    for el in arr:
        if fl == 0:
            newl.append(el)
            fl = 1
        else:
            newl = [el] + newl
            fl = 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in newl]))


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
