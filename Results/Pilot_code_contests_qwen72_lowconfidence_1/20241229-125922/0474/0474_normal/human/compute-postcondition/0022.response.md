The code snippet updates the list `newl` by prepending the third element of the `arr` list (`el`) to the current `newl`. 

- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100.
- `arr` remains a list of integers sorted in descending order with a length of `n`.
- `el` remains the third element in `arr`.
- `fl` remains either 0 or 1.
- `newl` is updated to include `el` at the beginning, making it `[el] + newl`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 3), `el` is the third element in `arr`, `fl` is either 0 or 1, `newl` is `[el] + newl`**.
