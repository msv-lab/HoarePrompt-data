Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the first element in `arr`. If `fl` is 0, `newl` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, and `fl` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `newl` remains `[el]`, and `fl` remains 0.***
