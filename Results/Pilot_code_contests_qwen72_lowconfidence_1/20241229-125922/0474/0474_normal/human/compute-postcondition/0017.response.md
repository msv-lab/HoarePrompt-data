The code snippet `fl = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `fl`. This changes the value of `fl` from whatever it was at the end of the previous iteration to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`, `fl` is 0, `newl` is `[el] + newl`**
