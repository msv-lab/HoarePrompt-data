The value of `el` is the third element in the list `arr`. The code appends `el` to the list `newl`. Since `newl` could initially be `[el]` or contain `[el]` prepended to some existing list, appending `el` again means `newl` will now contain `el` at least twice.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 3), `el` is the third element in `arr`, `fl` is either 0 or 1, `newl` is `[el, el]` or `[el]` followed by the existing elements of `newl` including another `el` at the end.**
