The code snippet `newl.append(el)` appends the second element (`el`) of the list `arr` to the list `newl`. The value of `el` is the second element in `arr`, and `newl` is updated to include this element.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2)
- `el` is the second element in `arr`
- `fl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `newl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration

After executing the code snippet:
- `newl` now includes the second element of `arr` (`el`)
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`, `fl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `newl` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration with `el` appended to it.**
