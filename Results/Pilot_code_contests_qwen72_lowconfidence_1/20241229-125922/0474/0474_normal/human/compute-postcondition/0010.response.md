The code snippet `newl = [el] + newl` modifies the list `newl` by prepending the first element of `arr` (stored in `el`) to the beginning of `newl`. Since `newl` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `newl` will contain only the value of `el`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `newl` is `[el]`, `fl` is not 0, `el` is the first element in `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `newl` is `[el]`, `fl` is not 0, `el` is the first element in `arr`**
