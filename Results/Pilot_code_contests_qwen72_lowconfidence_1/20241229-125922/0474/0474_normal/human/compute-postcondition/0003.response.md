The code snippet `newl = list()` initializes a new empty list named `newl`. This action does not affect the values of `n` or `arr`, which remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `newl` is an empty list.**
