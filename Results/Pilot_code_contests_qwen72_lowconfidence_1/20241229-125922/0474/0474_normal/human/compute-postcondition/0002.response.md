The code snippet `arr.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `arr` in descending order. This impacts the order of elements within `arr` but does not change its length or the value of `n`. The list `arr` now contains the same elements but sorted from the highest to the lowest.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`**.
