Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` representing the heights of `n` children. It sorts `arr` in descending order and then rearranges the elements into a new list `newl` such that the elements are placed alternately (the first element of `arr` becomes the last in `newl`, the second becomes the first, and so on). Finally, it prints the elements of `newl` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `n` being an integer within the range 2 to 100, `arr` being a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `newl` containing the elements of `arr` in the specified alternating order. The variable `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. The function does not compute or return the maximum height difference among the children as suggested by the incorrect annotation. **
