The code snippet `fl = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `fl`. This changes the value of `fl` from whatever it was previously to 1. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `el`, and `newl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`, `fl` is 1, `newl` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration with `el` appended to it.**
