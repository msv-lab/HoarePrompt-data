The code snippet provided sets the value of `fl` to 0. This update does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 3), `el` is the third element in `arr`, `fl` is 0, `newl` is `[el] + newl`**.
