The code `newl.append(el)` adds the value of `el` to the list `newl`. Since `el` is the first element in `arr`, and `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `el` is the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `newl` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `fl` is 0, `el` is the first element in `arr`.**
