The value of `n` is updated to the integer value input by the user through `raw_input()`. The previous value of `n` being within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 remains true as the new value of `n` must also conform to this constraint. The list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and their constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the heights of the children.**
