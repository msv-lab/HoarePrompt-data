Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 3), `el` is the third element in `arr`. If `fl` is 0, `fl` remains 0 and `newl` is `[el] + newl`. If `fl` is 1, `fl` is updated to 1 and `newl` is `[el, el]` or `[el]` followed by the existing elements of `newl` including another `el` at the end.***
