The code snippet prints the elements of the list `newl` as a space-separated string. The values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `newl`, `fl`, and `el` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n`, `newl` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in an alternating order (first element of `arr` is the last in `newl`, second is the first in `newl`, and so on), `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd, `el` is the last element of `arr`.**
