To analyze the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, let's break down the behavior of the loop step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`.
   - `newl` is an empty list.
   - `fl` is 0.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `el` in `arr`.
   - If `fl` is 0, `el` is appended to `newl`, and `fl` is set to 1.
   - If `fl` is 1, `el` is prepended to `newl`, and `fl` is set to 0.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The first element of `arr` is appended to `newl`.
   - The second element of `arr` is prepended to `newl`.
   - The third element of `arr` is appended to `newl`.
   - The fourth element of `arr` is prepended to `newl`.
   - This pattern continues, alternating between appending and prepending elements to `newl`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After `n` iterations, `newl` will contain all elements of `arr`, but in a specific order: the first element of `arr` will be last in `newl`, the second element will be first, the third will be second to last, and so on.
   - The final value of `fl` will depend on whether `n` is even or odd:
     - If `n` is even, `fl` will be 0.
     - If `n` is odd, `fl` will be 1.
   - `el` will be the last element of `arr` after the loop completes.

5. **Summary**:
   - `n` remains an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - `arr` remains a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, with a length of `n`.
   - `newl` will contain the elements of `arr` in an alternating order, starting with the first element of `arr` being the last element of `newl`, and the second element of `arr` being the first element of `newl`.
   - `fl` will be 0 if `n` is even, and 1 if `n` is odd.
   - `el` will be the last element of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n`, `newl` is a list containing the elements of `arr` in an alternating order (first element of `arr` is the last in `newl`, second is the first in `newl`, and so on), `fl` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd, `el` is the last element of `arr`.**
