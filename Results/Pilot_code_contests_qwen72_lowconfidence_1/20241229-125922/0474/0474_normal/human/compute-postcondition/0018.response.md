Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`. If `fl` was 0, then `fl` is now 1 and `newl` has `el` appended to it. Otherwise, if `fl` was not 0, `fl` remains 0 and `newl` is updated to `[el] + newl`.***
