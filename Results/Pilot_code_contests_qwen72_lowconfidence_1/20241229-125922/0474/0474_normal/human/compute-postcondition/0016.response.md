The value of `newl` is updated to include the second element of `arr` (`el`) at the beginning of the list. This means that `el` is prepended to the existing `newl`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `fl` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`, `fl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `newl` is `[el] + newl`**
