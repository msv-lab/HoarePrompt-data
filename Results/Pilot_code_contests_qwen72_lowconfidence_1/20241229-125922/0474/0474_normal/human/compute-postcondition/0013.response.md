To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2).
- `el` is the first element in `arr`.
- If `fl` is 0, `newl` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, and `fl` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `newl` remains `[el]`, and `fl` remains 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for el in arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `el` is the first element in `arr`.
   - `fl` is 0 or 1 (depending on the previous iteration).
   - `newl` is either `[el]` if `fl` was 0, or it remains unchanged if `fl` was 1.

3. **Adjustments for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `el` will be set to the next element in `arr`.
   - The list `arr` has at least 2 elements, so the next element exists.
   - The state of `fl` and `newl` will depend on the previous iteration, but they do not change the condition for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `arr` must be available. Since `arr` has at least 2 elements, the next element is the second element in the list.

### Adjusted State:
- `el` is the second element in `arr`.
- `fl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 0 or 1).
- `newl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either `[el]` if `fl` was 0, or unchanged if `fl` was 1).

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `el` is the second element in `arr`, `fl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `newl` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
