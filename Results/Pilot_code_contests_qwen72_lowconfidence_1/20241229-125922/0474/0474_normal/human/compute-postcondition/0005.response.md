To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can start and continue. The loop iterates over the elements in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. Given the initial state, let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100)**: This condition is already satisfied, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
2. **`arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`**: Since `arr` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, and given that `n` is at least 2, `arr` will always have at least one element. Therefore, this condition is also satisfied.
3. **`newl` is an empty list**: This does not affect the loop's execution directly, so no adjustment is needed.
4. **`fl` is 0**: This does not affect the loop's execution directly, so no adjustment is needed.

Given these points, the only necessary condition to ensure the loop executes is that `arr` is not empty. Since `n` is at least 2, `arr` will always have at least one element.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `arr` has at least one element and the loop variable `el` is set to the first element of `arr`.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order with a length of `n` (at least 2), `newl` is an empty list, `fl` is 0, `el` is the first element in `arr`**
