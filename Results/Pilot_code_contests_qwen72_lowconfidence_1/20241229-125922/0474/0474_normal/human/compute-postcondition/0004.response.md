The code snippet initializes the variable `fl` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or the state of the program beyond this assignment.

- `n` remains an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `arr` remains a list of integers representing the heights of the children, sorted in descending order, with a length equal to `n`.
- `newl` remains an empty list.
- `fl` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children sorted in descending order, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`; `newl` is an empty list; `fl` is 0.**
