The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into individual components, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `arr`. This means that `arr` will contain the integers from the input, each representing the height of a child. The value of `n` is not directly affected by this code, but the list `arr` is populated based on the input, which is expected to match the length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `arr` is a list of integers representing the heights of the children, and the length of `arr` is equal to `n`**.
