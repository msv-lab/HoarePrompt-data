The function `func` should accept two parameters: an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` (where `a` represents the heights of the children). The integer `n` is constrained such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each element in the list `a` (denoted as `a_i`) is constrained such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters, which seems incorrect based on the description. Assuming the correct function signature should be:

```python
def func(n, a):
```

Given the constraints and the relationship between the parameters, the function's output is not specified in your prompt. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the function is supposed to return the maximum height difference among the children.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It returns the maximum height difference among the children.**
