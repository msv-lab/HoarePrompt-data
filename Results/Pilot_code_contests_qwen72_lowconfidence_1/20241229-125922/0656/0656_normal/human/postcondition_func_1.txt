The function `func_2` reads input values for `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\). It then reads `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)` where each pair satisfies \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\). The function constructs a list `station` of `n` lists, where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input. After constructing `station`, the function calculates a list `max_candy` of `n` elements, where each `max_candy[i]` is the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function. Finally, the function computes and prints `n` values, each representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i` based on the elements in `station` and `max_candy`. The function does not return any value.
