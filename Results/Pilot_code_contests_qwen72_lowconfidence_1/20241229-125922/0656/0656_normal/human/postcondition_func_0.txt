The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the edge case where either or both `x` and `y` are zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD, or 0 if both are zero.
