You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is a simplified version of the task Toy Train. These two versions differ only in the constraints. Hacks for this version are disabled.

Alice received a set of Toy Train™ from Bob. It consists of one train and a connected railway network of n stations, enumerated from 1 through n. The train occupies one station at a time and travels around the network of stations in a circular manner. More precisely, the immediate station that the train will visit after station i is station i+1 if 1 ≤ i < n or station 1 if i = n. It takes the train 1 second to travel to its next station as described.

Bob gave Alice a fun task before he left: to deliver m candies that are initially at some stations to their independent destinations using the train. The candies are enumerated from 1 through m. Candy i (1 ≤ i ≤ m), now at station a_i, should be delivered to station b_i (a_i ≠ b_i).

<image> The blue numbers on the candies correspond to b_i values. The image corresponds to the 1-st example.

The train has infinite capacity, and it is possible to load off any number of candies at a station. However, only at most one candy can be loaded from a station onto the train before it leaves the station. You can choose any candy at this station. The time it takes to move the candies is negligible.

Now, Alice wonders how much time is needed for the train to deliver all candies. Your task is to find, for each station, the minimum time the train would need to deliver all the candies were it to start from there.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ m ≤ 200) — the number of stations and the number of candies, respectively.

The i-th of the following m lines contains two space-separated integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n; a_i ≠ b_i) — the station that initially contains candy i and the destination station of the candy, respectively.

Output

In the first and only line, print n space-separated integers, the i-th of which is the minimum time, in seconds, the train would need to deliver all the candies were it to start from station i.

Examples

Input

3 5


Output

Input


2 3
1 2

Output


5 6 

Note

Consider the second sample.

If the train started at station 1, the optimal strategy is as follows.

  1. Load the first candy onto the train. 
  2. Proceed to station 2. This step takes 1 second. 
  3. Deliver the first candy. 
  4. Proceed to station 1. This step takes 1 second. 
  5. Load the second candy onto the train. 
  6. Proceed to station 2. This step takes 1 second. 
  7. Deliver the second candy. 
  8. Proceed to station 1. This step takes 1 second. 
  9. Load the third candy onto the train. 
  10. Proceed to station 2. This step takes 1 second. 
  11. Deliver the third candy. 



Hence, the train needs 5 seconds to complete the tasks.

If the train were to start at station 2, however, it would need to move to station 1 before it could load the first candy, which would take one additional second. Thus, the answer in this scenario is 5+1 = 6 seconds.

        print(res, end=' ')

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where multiple candies at the same station need to be delivered to different stations. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum time to deliver all candies from a starting station does not correctly account for the order in which candies are picked up and delivered. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7 8 9 10 11
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may produce incorrect results because it does not properly consider the sequence of picking up and delivering candies. For example, starting from station 1, the train should pick up all three candies and deliver them in the correct order, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function concludes, `x` holds the GCD of the original `x` and `y`, and `y` is 0. The function correctly handles the edge case where either or both `x` and `y` are zero, returning the non-zero value as the GCD, or 0 if both are zero.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200. a and b are lists of integers where each element a[i] and b[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the final values of the variables and their relationships based on the loop code. Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
    #- `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element `a[i]` and `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].
    #- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(m):
    #    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    #    station[a - 1].append(b - 1)
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop runs `m` times.
    #   - In each iteration, the user inputs two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
    #   - The value `b - 1` is appended to the list at index `a - 1` in `station`.
    #
    #2. **Final State**:
    #   - After `m` iterations, `station` will be a list of `n` lists.
    #   - Each list `station[a - 1]` will contain all the values `b - 1` that were appended during the iterations where `a` was the corresponding index.
    #   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    #   - The values of `a` and `b` are specific integers input by the user in each iteration, and they do not retain any specific final value after the loop (they are overwritten in each iteration).
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
    #- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
    #- For each valid pair `(a, b)` input during the loop, the list `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input.
    #- The loop will execute `m` times, and `i` will be `m - 1` after the last iteration.
    #- `a` and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`.**

                j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` has completed all iterations from `0` to `n-1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` has been calculated and printed `n` times, each time representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i`, `j` has been used in the inner loop and will have taken on values from `i` to `i + n - 1` modulo `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input values for `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\). It then reads `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)` where each pair satisfies \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\). The function constructs a list `station` of `n` lists, where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input. After constructing `station`, the function calculates a list `max_candy` of `n` elements, where each `max_candy[i]` is the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function. Finally, the function computes and prints `n` values, each representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i` based on the elements in `station` and `max_candy`. The function does not return any value.
