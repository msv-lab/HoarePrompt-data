Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the problem as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation of the `max_candy` array and the subsequent computation of the minimum time required to deliver all candies from each starting station are flawed.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `max_candy`:**
   - The function attempts to find the minimum distance to the destination for each station, but the logic used is incorrect. The key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i` does not correctly calculate the minimum distance in a circular network.
   - For example, if `i = 3` and `x = 1`, the distance should be `n - (3 - 1) = n - 2`, but the current logic would incorrectly compute it as `1 + n - 3 = n - 2`.

2. **Incorrect Distance Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the distance `dist` as `j - i`, which is incorrect for a circular network. The correct distance between stations `i` and `j` in a circular network should be `min((j - i) % n, (i - j) % n)`.
   - Additionally, the way the function adds the distance to the destination and the number of candies at the station is not correct. The formula `dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)` is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the following input:
```
5 7
2 4
5 1
2 3
3 4
4 1
5 3
3 5
```

The expected output is:
```
10 9 10 10 9
```

However, the current implementation will likely produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem for every potential case, particularly in the calculation of distances and the overall delivery time. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
