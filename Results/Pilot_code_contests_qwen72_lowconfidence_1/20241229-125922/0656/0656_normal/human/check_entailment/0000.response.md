Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where multiple candies at the same station need to be delivered to different stations. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum time to deliver all candies from a starting station does not correctly account for the order in which candies are picked up and delivered. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
5 3
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7 8 9 10 11
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may produce incorrect results because it does not properly consider the sequence of picking up and delivering candies. For example, starting from station 1, the train should pick up all three candies and deliver them in the correct order, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
