Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple candies need to be picked up from the same station and delivered to different destinations correctly. Specifically, the calculation of `max_candy` is flawed because it only considers the minimum distance to the destination from the current station, but it does not account for the fact that the train might need to make multiple rounds to pick up and deliver all candies from that station.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 3
1 3
1 4
1 5
```
Here, the train starts at station 1 and needs to deliver three candies to stations 3, 4, and 5. The program incorrectly calculates the minimum time required, as it does not account for the need to make multiple rounds to deliver all candies.

The correct output for this input should be:
```
5 6 7 8 9
```
However, the program will produce an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
