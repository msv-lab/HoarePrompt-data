Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where the train starts at a station that does not have any candies to pick up. The calculation of the minimum time to deliver all candies from a given starting station is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the train might need to move to another station to pick up a candy before delivering any. This oversight can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 7
2 4
5 1
2 3
3 4
4 1
5 3
3 5
```

If the train starts at station 1, it will need to move to station 2 to pick up the first candy, then proceed to station 4 to deliver it, and so on. The current implementation does not correctly account for this initial movement to the first station with a candy, leading to an incorrect minimum time calculation.

Additionally, the way `max_candy` is calculated and used in the distance calculation might not always yield the correct minimum time, especially when considering the circular nature of the train's movement and the need to pick up and deliver multiple candies efficiently.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
