Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of stations `n` and the number of candies `m`.
   - It initializes a list `station` of `n` empty lists to store the destination stations for each starting station.

2. **Populating the Station List**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, reading the starting station `a` and the destination station `b` for each candy.
   - It appends the destination station `b - 1` to the list at index `a - 1` in `station`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Distances**:
   - The list `max_candy` is initialized to store the minimum distance for each station.
   - For each station `i`, it finds the minimum distance to the destination station using the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
   - For each starting station `i`, it initializes `res` to 0.
   - It iterates over the stations in a circular manner, calculating the distance for each station.
   - It updates `res` with the maximum distance required to deliver all candies starting from station `i`.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each starting station.

The code handles the following aspects correctly:
- **Circular Movement**: The train moves in a circular manner, and the code correctly handles the circular nature of the stations.
- **Loading and Delivering Candies**: The code ensures that the train loads and delivers candies efficiently, considering the constraints and the circular movement.
- **Edge Cases**: The code handles cases where a station might not have any candies to deliver.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
