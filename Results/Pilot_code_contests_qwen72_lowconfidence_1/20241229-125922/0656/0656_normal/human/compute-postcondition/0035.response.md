The value of `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dist`. The values of `n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `dist` was previously calculated as `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `j` is `j % n`.**
