You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200. a and b are lists of integers where each element a[i] and b[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].
def func_2():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    station = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        station[a - 1].append(b - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the final values of the variables and their relationships based on the loop code. Let's break it down step by step:
    #
    #### Initial State:
    #- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
    #- `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element `a[i]` and `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].
    #- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists.
    #
    #### Loop Code:
    #```python
    #for i in range(m):
    #    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    #    station[a - 1].append(b - 1)
    #```
    #
    #### Analysis:
    #1. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - The loop runs `m` times.
    #   - In each iteration, the user inputs two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
    #   - The value `b - 1` is appended to the list at index `a - 1` in `station`.
    #
    #2. **Final State**:
    #   - After `m` iterations, `station` will be a list of `n` lists.
    #   - Each list `station[a - 1]` will contain all the values `b - 1` that were appended during the iterations where `a` was the corresponding index.
    #   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    #   - The values of `a` and `b` are specific integers input by the user in each iteration, and they do not retain any specific final value after the loop (they are overwritten in each iteration).
    #
    #### Output State:
    #- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
    #- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
    #- For each valid pair `(a, b)` input during the loop, the list `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input.
    #- The loop will execute `m` times, and `i` will be `m - 1` after the last iteration.
    #- `a` and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration.
    #
    #Therefore, the output state is:
    #**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`.**
    max_candy = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        try:
            max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is `n - 1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.
    for i in range(n):
        res = 0
        
        for j in range(i, i + n):
            if len(station[j % n]) == 0:
                continue
            dist = j - i
            j %= n
            dist += (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[
                j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)
            res = max(res, dist)
        
        print(res, end=' ')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` has completed all iterations from `0` to `n-1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` has been calculated and printed `n` times, each time representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i`, `j` has been used in the inner loop and will have taken on values from `i` to `i + n - 1` modulo `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` (an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200), `a` (a list of integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n), and `b` (a list of integers where each element `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ n and `a[i] ≠ b[i]`). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
