To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Range of Loop Execution**: The loop `for j in range(i, i + n)` will execute as long as `i + n` is greater than `i`. Given that `i` is 0, the loop will always execute if `n` is positive.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.
   - `res` is 0.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop `for j in range(i, i + n)` will execute as long as `i + n` is greater than `i`. Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Given that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), this condition is already satisfied.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `j` will start at `i` (which is 0) and go up to `i + n - 1` (which is `n - 1`).
   - No adjustments are needed for `n`, `m`, `station`, `max_candy`, or `res` since they are already in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The initial state is sufficient.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0**
