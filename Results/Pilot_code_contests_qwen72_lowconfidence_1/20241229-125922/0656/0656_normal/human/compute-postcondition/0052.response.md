To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.
- `res` is the maximum distance calculated from all valid `j` in the range `[i, i + n)`.
- `j` is `(i + n - 1) % n`.
- The value of `res` has been printed.

### Loop Structure:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `max_candy` and `res` are computed based on the current value of `i`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Increment `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
- **Update `max_candy` and `res`**: These values are dependent on the new value of `i` and need to be recomputed.
- **Update `j`**: `j` is calculated as `(i + n - 1) % n`. With `i` incremented, `j` will also change.

### New State:
- `i` is now 1.
- `max_candy[1]` will be computed based on the new value of `i` (which is 1).
- `res` will be the maximum distance calculated from all valid `j` in the range `[1, 1 + n)`.
- `j` will be `(1 + n - 1) % n`, which simplifies to `0`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum distance calculated from all valid `j` in the range `[1, 1 + n)`, `j` is `0`.**
