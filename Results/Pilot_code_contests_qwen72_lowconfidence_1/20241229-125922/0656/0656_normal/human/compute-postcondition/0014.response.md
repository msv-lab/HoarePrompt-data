The given code updates the `max_candy` list at index `i` with the minimum value from the list `station[i]`, where the minimum is determined by a custom key function. This key function adjusts the values in `station[i]` based on their relationship to `i`.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists, where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)` updates the `max_candy` list at index `i`.
   - The `min` function is applied to `station[i]` with a custom key function.
   - The key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i` modifies the values in `station[i]`:
     - If `x < i`, the value is adjusted to `x + n - i`.
     - If `x >= i`, the value remains `x - i`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The value of `max_candy[i]` is updated to the minimum value from `station[i]` after applying the key function.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, and the rest of `max_candy`) remain unchanged.

4. **Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `station[i]` contains values `[v1, v2, ..., vk]`.
   - For each value `v` in `station[i]`:
     - If `v < i`, the key value is `v + n - i`.
     - If `v >= i`, the key value is `v - i`.
   - The `min` function selects the minimum value based on these key values.

5. **Output State:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists, where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros, except `max_candy[i]` which is the minimum value from `station[i]` after applying the key function.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros except `max_candy[i]` which is the minimum value from `station[i]` after applying the key function `x + n - i if x < i else x - i`.**
