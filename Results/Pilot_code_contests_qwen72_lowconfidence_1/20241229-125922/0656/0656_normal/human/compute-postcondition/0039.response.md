The code snippet `dist = j - i` updates the value of `dist` by setting it to the difference between `j` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`
- `dist` is `dist + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`
- `j` is 1

The impact of the code snippet:
- `dist` is updated to `j - i`, which is `1 - 0` = `1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`
- `dist` is 1
- `j` is 1

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`, `dist` is 1, `j` is 1**
