To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `res` is the maximum distance calculated over all valid stations.
   - `j` is `(i + n - 1) % n`.
   - `dist` is the last calculated distance.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `j` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is recalculated as `(i + n - 1) % n` with the new value of `i`.

Since `res` and `dist` are not directly affected by the loop increment, they remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`res` is the maximum distance calculated over all valid stations, `j` is `((i + 1) + n - 1) % n`, `dist` is the last calculated distance, all other variables remain unchanged.**
