The code `j %= n` computes the remainder of `j` divided by `n` and assigns the result back to `j`. Given the initial state where `j` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, the result of `1 % n` is always 1 (since 1 is less than `n`).

Therefore, the value of `j` remains 1 after the execution of the code. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`, `dist` is 1, `j` is 1**
