The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The new values of `n` and `m` replace their previous values, but they must still satisfy the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200. The lists `a` and `b` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, a and b are lists of integers where each element a[i] and b[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i]**.
