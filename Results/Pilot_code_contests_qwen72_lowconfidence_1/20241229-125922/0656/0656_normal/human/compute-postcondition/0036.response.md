To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- **`n`**: An integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- **`m`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- **`station`**: A list of `n` lists.
- **`i`**: 0.
- **`max_candy`**: A list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.
- **`res`**: Updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dist`.
- **`dist`**: Calculated as `dist + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
- **`j`**: `j % n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i, i + n)`. Since `i` is 0, the loop iterates over `range(0, n)`, which means it will run `n` times, from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `j` is currently `j % n`. Given that `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - **`j`**: Needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - **`dist`**: Needs to be recalculated using the new value of `j`.
   - **`res`**: Will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the new `dist`.

### Updated State:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`station`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`max_candy`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`j`**: Increments by 1.
- **`dist`**: Recalculated as `dist + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`.
- **`res`**: Updated to the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is 1.**
