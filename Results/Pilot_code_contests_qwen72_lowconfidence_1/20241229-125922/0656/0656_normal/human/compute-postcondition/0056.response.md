The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end immediately and moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. However, since this is a standalone `continue` statement and there's no enclosing loop mentioned in the context, the effect is minimal. No variables are altered by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `j` is 1, and the list `station[j % n]` is empty.**
