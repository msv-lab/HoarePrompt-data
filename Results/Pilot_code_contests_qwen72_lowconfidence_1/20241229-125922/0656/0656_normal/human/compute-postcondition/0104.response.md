To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the changes to the variables over time.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is initialized to `n - 1`.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.

### Loop Analysis:
The outer loop iterates `n` times, from `0` to `n-1`. For each iteration of `i`:
- `res` is initialized to `0`.
- An inner loop iterates over `j` from `i` to `i + n - 1`.
- For each `j`, the following steps are performed:
  - If `station[j % n]` is empty, the loop continues to the next `j`.
  - Otherwise, `dist` is calculated based on the position `j` and the value `max_candy[j % n]`.
  - `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dist`.
- After the inner loop completes, `res` is printed.

### Final Output State:
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- `station` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `i` will have completed all iterations from `0` to `n-1`.
- `max_candy` remains a list of `n` elements with the same properties as described in the initial state.
- `res` will have been calculated and printed `n` times, each time representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i`.
- `j` will have been used in the inner loop and will have taken on values from `i` to `i + n - 1` modulo `n`.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes all iterations:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` has completed all iterations from `0` to `n-1`.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function.
- `res` has been calculated and printed `n` times, each time representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i`.
- `j` has been used in the inner loop and will have taken on values from `i` to `i + n - 1` modulo `n`.
