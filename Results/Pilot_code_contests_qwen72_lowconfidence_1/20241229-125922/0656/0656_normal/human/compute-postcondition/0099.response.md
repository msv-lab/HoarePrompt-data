The code snippet `j %= n` modifies the value of `j` by setting it to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Given the initial state:

- `j` is `((i % n) + 2) % n`
- `n` is greater than 0

After executing `j %= n`, `j` will be set to the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is already the result of a modulo operation with `n` (i.e., `((i % n) + 2) % n`), the value of `j` remains unchanged because `j` is already less than `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `j - i`, `j` is `((i % n) + 2) % n`, `dist` is `j - i`, `n` is greater than 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, the same conditions apply.**
