The `continue` statement causes the current iteration of a loop to end, and the control flow to immediately jump to the next iteration of the loop. It does not alter the values of any variables directly. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the fact that the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`res` is 0, `j` is `i`, `dist` is the last calculated distance, `n` must be greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged, and the length of `station[j % n]` is 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
