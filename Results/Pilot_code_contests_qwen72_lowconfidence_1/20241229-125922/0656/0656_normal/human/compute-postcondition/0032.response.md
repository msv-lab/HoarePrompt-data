The code snippet assigns the value of `j - i` to the variable `dist`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is 0
- If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, the current iteration of the loop or immediate context is skipped

After executing the code snippet `dist = j - i`, the value of `dist` is calculated as `j - 0` (since `i` is 0). Therefore, `dist` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `dist` is `j`. If the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0, the current iteration of the loop or immediate context is skipped.**
