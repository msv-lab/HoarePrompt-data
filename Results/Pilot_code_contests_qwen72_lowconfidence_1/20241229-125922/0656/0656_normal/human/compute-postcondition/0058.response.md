The code snippet `dist = j - i` calculates the difference between `j` and `i` and assigns this value to the variable `dist`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is 0
- `j` is 1

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the calculation `dist = j - i` results in `dist = 1 - 1 = 0`.

The output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 1
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `dist` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `j` is 1, `dist` is 0**
