To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For this loop to execute:
- The range function `range(i, i + n)` must generate at least one value.
- This means that the starting value `i` should be less than the ending value `i + n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The range will be `range(1, 1 + n)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `1 + n` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `n > 0`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is always greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists.
   - `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is determined by a specific condition.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j`, which should be set to the starting value of the range, which is `i` (1 in this case).

### Final State
Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `n`, we only need to ensure that `j` is correctly set to 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `j` is 1**.
