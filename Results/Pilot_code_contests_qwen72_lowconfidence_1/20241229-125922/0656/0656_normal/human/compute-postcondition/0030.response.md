The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed with the next iteration. Since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided snippet, it implies that this `continue` statement is part of a larger context (like being inside a loop or conditional block). However, without the context of the loop or the condition, the `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values but affects the flow control.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the additional note that the current iteration of the loop (or the immediate context) is skipped.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, and the length of the list `station[j % n]` is 0. The current iteration of the loop or immediate context is skipped.**
