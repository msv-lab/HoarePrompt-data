The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. This does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of control within the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is the maximum of its previous value and `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`
- `dist` is now equal to `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`
- `j` is `i + 1`
- All other variables remain unchanged

After executing the `continue` statement:
- The values of `res`, `dist`, and `j` remain the same as specified in the initial state.
- The program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any subsequent code in the current iteration.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the loop control behavior.

Output State: **`res` is the maximum of its previous value and `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `dist` is now equal to `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is `i + 1`, all other variables remain unchanged, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
