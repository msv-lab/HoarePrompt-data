The value of `j` is updated by taking the modulus of `j` with `n`. Given that `j` is 2 and \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), the result of `2 % n` will be 2 for any valid `n` (since 2 is less than any valid `n`).

Therefore, `j` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`, `dist` is 2, `j` is 2**
