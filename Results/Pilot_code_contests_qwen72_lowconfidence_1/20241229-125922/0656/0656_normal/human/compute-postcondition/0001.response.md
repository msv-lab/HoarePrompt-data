The code initializes a list of lists named `station` with `n` sublists, each of which is initially empty. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`.

Output State: **n and m are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, a and b are lists of integers where each element a[i] and b[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i], station is a list of n empty lists.**
