The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context given, we can infer that `func_2` likely accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here's the step-by-step description:

- **Parameters:**
  - `n`: An integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
  - `m`: An integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
  - `a`: A list of integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n.
  - `b`: A list of integers where each element `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ n and `a[i] ≠ b[i]`.

- **Return Value:**
  - The output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on typical function behavior with such parameters, it might involve some computation or processing involving the lists `a` and `b` and the integers `n` and `m`.

Since the specific output is not provided, I'll describe the general functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` (an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200), `a` (a list of integers where each element `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n), and `b` (a list of integers where each element `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ b[i] ≤ n and `a[i] ≠ b[i]`). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided parameters.**
