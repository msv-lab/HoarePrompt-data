To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet in the context of the initial state.

Initial State: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4

Code Snippet:
```python
max_candy[i] = min(station[i], key=lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i)
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is greater than 4 (let's denote it as `n > 4`).

2. **Understand the Code:**
   - The code assigns a value to `max_candy[i]` using the `min` function.
   - The `min` function is applied to `station[i]` with a custom key function.
   - The key function is a lambda function that calculates a value based on the condition `x < i`.

3. **Evaluate the Key Function:**
   - For each element `x` in `station[i]`:
     - If `x < i` (i.e., `x < 4`), the key is `x + n - i`.
     - If `x >= i` (i.e., `x >= 4`), the key is `x - i`.

4. **Determine the Minimum Value:**
   - The `min` function will select the element from `station[i]` that results in the smallest key value.

5. **Update `max_candy[i]`:**
   - `max_candy[4]` will be assigned the element from `station[4]` that minimizes the key function.

Since the exact values of `station[i]` are not provided, we cannot compute the specific value of `max_candy[4]`. However, we can describe the process and the resulting state.

Output State:
- `i` is 4.
- `n` is greater than 4.
- `max_candy[4]` is assigned the element from `station[4]` that minimizes the key function `x + n - i` if `x < 4` or `x - i` if `x >= 4`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `max_candy[4]` is assigned the element from `station[4]` that minimizes the key function `x + n - 4` if `x < 4` or `x - 4` if `x >= 4`.**
