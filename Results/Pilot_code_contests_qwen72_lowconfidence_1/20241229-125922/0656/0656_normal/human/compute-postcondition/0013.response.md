To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will iterate `n` times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
2. **Initial State of `i`**: The initial state given is `i` is `m - 1`. However, this initial state is irrelevant for the loop because the loop will reassign `i` starting from 0.
3. **List `station`**: The list `station` is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains elements appended during `m` iterations. This structure is consistent with the loop's requirement.
4. **List `max_candy`**: The list `max_candy` is initialized to `n` zeros, which is also consistent with the loop's requirement.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` will be reinitialized by the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 100, this condition is satisfied.
- **List `station` and `max_candy`**: These lists are already structured correctly for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Since the initial state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros**
