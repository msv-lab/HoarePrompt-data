To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the final values of the variables and their relationships based on the loop code. Let's break it down step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element `a[i]` and `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].
- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    station[a - 1].append(b - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - In each iteration, the user inputs two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
   - The value `b - 1` is appended to the list at index `a - 1` in `station`.

2. **Final State**:
   - After `m` iterations, `station` will be a list of `n` lists.
   - Each list `station[a - 1]` will contain all the values `b - 1` that were appended during the iterations where `a` was the corresponding index.
   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - The values of `a` and `b` are specific integers input by the user in each iteration, and they do not retain any specific final value after the loop (they are overwritten in each iteration).

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- For each valid pair `(a, b)` input during the loop, the list `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input.
- The loop will execute `m` times, and `i` will be `m - 1` after the last iteration.
- `a` and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`.**
