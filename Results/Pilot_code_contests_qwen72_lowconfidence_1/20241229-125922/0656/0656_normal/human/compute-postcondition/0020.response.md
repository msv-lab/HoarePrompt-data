A `ValueError` can occur when the `min()` function is called on an iterable (in this case, `station[i]`) that contains no elements, or if all elements in the iterable are filtered out by the condition in the lambda function. This would lead to the `min()` function having no values to compare, hence raising a `ValueError`.

In the given code, the `try` block attempts to assign to `max_candy[4]` the element from `station[4]` that minimizes the key function `x + n - 4` if `x < 4` or `x - 4` if `x >= 4`. If `station[4]` is empty or if all elements in `station[4]` are filtered out by the lambda function, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the `except` block will handle this by doing nothing (`pass`).

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. If `station[4]` is not empty and contains at least one element that satisfies the lambda function, `max_candy[4]` is assigned the element from `station[4]` that minimizes the key function. If `station[4]` is empty or all elements are filtered out, no assignment to `max_candy[4]` occurs.
