To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dist`.
- `j` remains `((i % n) + 1) % n`.
- `dist` remains `((i % n) + 1) - i + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `range(i, i + n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within this range.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `i` remains the same throughout the loop.
   - `n` is greater than 0 and does not change.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `((i % n) + 1) % n`.
- For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
- Since `j` is calculated as `((i % n) + 1) % n`, incrementing `j` by 1 gives us `((i % n) + 2) % n`.

### Updated State:
- `res` remains the same as it is updated based on the maximum of its current value and `dist`.
- `j` is now `((i % n) + 2) % n`.
- `dist` remains the same as it is calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, `station`, and `max_candy`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dist`, `j` is `((i % n) + 2) % n`, `dist` remains `((i % n) + 1) - i + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `n` is greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged**.
