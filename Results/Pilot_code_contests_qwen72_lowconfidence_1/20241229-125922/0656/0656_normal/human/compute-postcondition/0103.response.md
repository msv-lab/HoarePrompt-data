The code snippet `print(res, end=' ')` prints the value of `res` followed by a space, without changing the value of `res` or any other variable in the state. The output state remains the same except for the side effect of printing.

Output State: **`res` is the maximum distance calculated from all valid stations, `j` is `(i + n - 1) % n`, `dist` is the last calculated distance, `n` is greater than 0, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
