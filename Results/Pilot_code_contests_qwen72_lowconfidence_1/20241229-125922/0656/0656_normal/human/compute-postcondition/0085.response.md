The value of `j` is updated to `j % n`. Given that `j` was initially equal to `i`, the new value of `j` is `i % n`. Since `n` is specified to be greater than 0, this operation ensures `j` is within the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `res` is 0
- `dist` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`res` is 0, `j` is `i % n`, `dist` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged.**
