The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within certain ranges, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, and `i` is 0.
- After executing the code, the variables `a` and `b` are updated to the values read from the input.

Since the input values for `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, they will take new values based on the input provided. However, the constraints that `1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n` and `a[i] ≠ b[i]` should still hold true for these new values.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are now specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `station` is a list of `n` empty lists, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**.
