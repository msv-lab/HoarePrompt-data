### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element `a[i]` and `b[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ n and a[i] ≠ b[i].
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is `m - 1` after the last iteration of the loop.
- `a` and `b` are not defined after the loop as they are re-assigned in each iteration.

### Code:
```python
max_candy = [0] * n
```

### Analysis:
- The code initializes a new list `max_candy` with `n` elements, all set to 0.
- This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `station`, or `i`.
- The list `max_candy` is now a list of `n` zeros.

### Output State:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations.
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `station` is a list of `n` lists where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input during the `m` iterations, `i` is `m - 1`, `max_candy` is a list of `n` zeros.**
