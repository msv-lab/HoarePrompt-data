`dist` is assigned the value of `j - i`. Given that `j` is equal to `i` initially, `dist` becomes `0`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is 0, `j` is `i`, `dist` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged. If the length of `station[j % n]` is 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
