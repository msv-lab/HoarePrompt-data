Postcondition: ***`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dist`, `j` is `((i % n) + 2) % n`, `dist` remains `((i % n) + 1) - i + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `n` is greater than 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, the same conditions apply as stated above.***
