To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `station[4]` is not empty and contains at least one element that satisfies the lambda function, leading to an assignment to `max_candy[4]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5.

4. **Station and Max_candy**:
   - The state of `station[5]` and `max_candy[5]` will depend on the contents of `station[5]` and the lambda function. If `station[5]` is not empty and contains at least one element that satisfies the lambda function, `max_candy[5]` will be assigned the element from `station[5]` that minimizes the key function. If `station[5]` is empty or all elements are filtered out, no assignment to `max_candy[5]` will occur.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, if `station[5]` is not empty and contains at least one element that satisfies the lambda function, `max_candy[5]` is assigned the element from `station[5]` that minimizes the key function; otherwise, no assignment to `max_candy[5]` occurs.**
