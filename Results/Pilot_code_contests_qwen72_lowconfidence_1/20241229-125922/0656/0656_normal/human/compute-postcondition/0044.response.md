The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`, `dist` is `1 + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is 2**
