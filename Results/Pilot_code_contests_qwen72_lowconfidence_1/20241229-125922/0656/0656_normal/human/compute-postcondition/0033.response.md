The code `j %= n` performs a modulo operation on `j` with `n` and assigns the result back to `j`. This ensures that `j` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function
- `res` is 0
- `dist` is `j`

After executing `j %= n`:
- The value of `j` is now `j % n`, which means `j` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `res`, `dist`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `dist` is `j`, `j` is `j % n`**
