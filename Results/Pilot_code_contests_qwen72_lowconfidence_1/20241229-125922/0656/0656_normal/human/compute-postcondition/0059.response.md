The code snippet `j %= n` computes the remainder of `j` divided by `n` and assigns the result back to `j`. Given that `j` is initially 1 and `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), the remainder of 1 divided by any value of `n` in this range will always be 1. Therefore, `j` remains 1.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, `i`, `max_candy`, `res`, and `dist`) are not affected by this operation and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 1, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is 0, `j` is 1, `dist` is 0**
