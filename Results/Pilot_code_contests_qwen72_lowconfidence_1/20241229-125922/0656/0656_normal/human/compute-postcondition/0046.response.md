The code snippet updates the value of `dist` by setting it to the difference between `j` and `i`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\)
- `station` is a list of `n` lists
- `i` is 0
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements
- `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`
- `dist` is `1 + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`
- `j` is 2

The new value of `dist` is calculated as:
```python
dist = j - i
```
Given `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the new value of `dist` is:
```python
dist = 2 - 0
dist = 2
```

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`, `dist` is 2, `j` is 2**
