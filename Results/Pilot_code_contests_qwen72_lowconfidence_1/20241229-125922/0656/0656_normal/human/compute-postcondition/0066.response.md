The value of `j` is updated to `j % n`. Given that `j` was initially `i + 1`, the new value of `j` will be `(i + 1) % n`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is the maximum of its previous value and `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `dist` is 1, `j` is `(i + 1) % n`, all other variables remain unchanged. If `len(station[j % n]) == 0`, we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
