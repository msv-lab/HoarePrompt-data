Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements where each `max_candy[i]` is either the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and the new `dist`, `dist` is `dist + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is 1. If `station[j % n]` is empty, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
