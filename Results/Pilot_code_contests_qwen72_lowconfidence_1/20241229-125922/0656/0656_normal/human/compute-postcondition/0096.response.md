The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that the values of the variables `res`, `j`, `dist`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the state of the program is not altered in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`res` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dist`, `j` is `((i % n) + 2) % n`, `dist` remains `((i % n) + 1) - i + (len(station[j]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[j] + n - j if max_candy[j] < j else max_candy[j] - j)`, `n` is greater than 0, all other variables remain unchanged**
