The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

- `a` and `b` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The constraints for `a` and `b` remain the same: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1.**
