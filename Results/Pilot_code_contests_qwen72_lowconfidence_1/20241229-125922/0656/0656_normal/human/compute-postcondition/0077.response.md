The code snippet prints the value of `res` followed by a space without moving to a new line. The variables `res`, `j`, and `dist` retain their original values, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`res` is the maximum distance calculated over all valid stations, `j` is `(i + n - 1) % n`, `dist` is the last calculated distance, all other variables remain unchanged.**
