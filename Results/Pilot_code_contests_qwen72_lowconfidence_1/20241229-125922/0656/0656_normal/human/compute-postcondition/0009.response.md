The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This updates the values of `a` and `b` to the new integers provided by the input.

The initial conditions state that `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 < m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1, b - 1]`, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 2.

After executing the code snippet, the new values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input. The rest of the conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 < m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1, b - 1]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2**
