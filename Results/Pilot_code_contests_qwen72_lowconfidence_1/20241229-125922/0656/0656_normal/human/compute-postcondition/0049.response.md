`res` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `res` and the new value of `dist`. The value of `dist` is already updated to its new value as per the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dist` is updated to its new value, `res` is the maximum value between the previous `res` and the new `dist`.
Output State: **`dist` is updated to its new value, `res` is the maximum value between the previous `res` and the new `dist`**
