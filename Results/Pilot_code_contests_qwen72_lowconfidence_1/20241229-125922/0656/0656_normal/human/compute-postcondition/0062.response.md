To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `j = i` to `j = i + n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `i + n`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `res` is the maximum of its previous value and `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`.
   - `dist` is now equal to `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` from `i` to `i + n - 1`, the next iteration will start with `j` incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which will be incremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`res`, `dist`, and any other variables) remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`res` is the maximum of its previous value and `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `dist` is now equal to `(len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is `i + 1`, all other variables remain unchanged.**
