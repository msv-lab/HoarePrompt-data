To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
   - `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
   - `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1]`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` is greater than 0.

Given this information, the loop will execute as long as `i < m`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1.**
