The code snippet `station[a - 1].append(b - 1)` modifies the list `station` by appending the value `b - 1` to the list located at index `a - 1` in `station`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200.
- `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input).
- `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.

After executing the code:
- The list `station[a - 1]` now contains an additional element `b - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1, b - 1]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1.**

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1, b - 1]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1.**
