The code snippet modifies the `station` list by appending the value `b - 1` to the list located at index `a - 1`.

- `station` is a list of `n` empty lists.
- `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b.
- After executing the code, the list at index `a - 1` in `station` will contain one element, which is `b - 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are now specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b, `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1]`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0.**
