Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input values for `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\). It then reads `m` pairs of integers `(a, b)` where each pair satisfies \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\). The function constructs a list `station` of `n` lists, where each `station[a - 1]` contains the elements `b - 1` appended in the order they were input. After constructing `station`, the function calculates a list `max_candy` of `n` elements, where each `max_candy[i]` is the element from `station[i]` that minimizes the key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i`, or `0` if `station[i]` is empty or all elements are filtered out by the key function. Finally, the function computes and prints `n` values, each representing the maximum distance for the corresponding `i` based on the elements in `station` and `max_candy`. The function does not return any value. **

### Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Empty Input for `station[i]`:** If `station[i]` is empty, `max_candy[i]` will be set to `0`. This is handled correctly in the code.
- **Invalid Input:** The function assumes valid input where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\). If invalid input is provided, the function may raise an error or produce incorrect results.
- **Edge Case for `max_candy` Calculation:** The key function `lambda x: x + n - i if x < i else x - i` might lead to unexpected behavior if `x` is very close to `i` or if `x` is significantly larger or smaller than `i`. However, the function handles this by using the `min` function with the key, which should generally work as intended.
- **Output Format:** The function prints the results directly to the console, which may not be ideal for automated testing or further processing. Consider returning the results instead.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation in the inner loop ensures that `j` wraps around when it exceeds `n - 1`, which is necessary for the circular nature of the problem. However, this assumes that `n` is not zero, which is guaranteed by the input constraints.
