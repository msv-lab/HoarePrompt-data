To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\).
- `station` is a list of `n` lists.
- `i` is 0.
- `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements.
- `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`.
- `dist` is calculated as `1 + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`.
- `j` is 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i, i + n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `i` to `i + n`. Since `i` is 0, the loop will iterate from `0` to `n - 1`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1, which means the loop has already executed once for `j = 0`.

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **`j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the current value of `j` is 1, the next value of `j` will be 2.
- **Loop Range**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `[0, n - 1]`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute for `j = 2` as long as `j` is less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `station`, `max_candy`, `res`, `dist`) remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop condition or the loop itself (as the loop body is omitted).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 200\), `station` is a list of `n` lists, `i` is 0, `max_candy` is a list of `n` elements, `res` is the maximum of the original `res` and `dist`, `dist` is `1 + (len(station[1]) - 1) * n + (max_candy[1] + n - 1 if max_candy[1] < 1 else max_candy[1] - 1)`, `j` is 2**
