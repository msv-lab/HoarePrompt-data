According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` is known to be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3. For the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4, and for the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
