According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition that `i` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 < m ≤ 200, `a` and `b` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b (values updated from input), `station` is a list of `n` lists where `station[a - 1]` contains `[b - 1, b - 1]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2**
