The function `items` is part of a class and does not directly relate to the problem description provided. For the problem described, the inputs are `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of stations (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `m` is the number of candies (1 ≤ m ≤ 200). Each candy is represented by a pair `(a_i, b_i)` where `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n` and `a_i ≠ b_i`.
