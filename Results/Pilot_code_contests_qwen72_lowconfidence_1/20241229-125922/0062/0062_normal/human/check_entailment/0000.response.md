Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for all potential cases:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function `raw_input()` is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This means the program will not run correctly in Python 3 environments, which is a common setup these days.

2. **Logic for calculating the maximum profit**: The program calculates the maximum profit by iterating through the prices and checking the difference between consecutive days. However, it only updates the `tem` variable if the current profit (`x[i] - x[i + 1]`) is greater than the current `tem` and the profit after subtracting the cost `C` is positive. This approach might miss cases where the profit is maximized by selling on a different day.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the prices are in a strictly increasing order, the program will return 0, which might not be the correct answer if the cost `C` is very small.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
3 0
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

This case works as expected, but let's consider another case:

**Input:**
```
4 1
10 5 8 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

However, if we consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
4 1
10 5 8 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

But if we consider a different order:

**Input:**
```
4 1
10 8 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

In this case, the program fails to correctly calculate the maximum profit because it only checks the immediate next day, missing the opportunity to sell on a later day where the profit could be higher. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
