Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum profit. Specifically, the condition `if tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1] and x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:` is not correctly handling all cases. The issue arises because the program updates `tem` only if the current profit `x[i] - x[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to the previously stored maximum profit `tem`. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 1
5 10 7 3 20
```

The program should output `3`, but it will output `2` due to the flawed logic. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. On day 1, the price is 5.
2. On day 2, the price is 10. The profit if selling on day 1 and buying on day 2 would be `5 - 10 - 1 = -6` (not profitable).
3. On day 3, the price is 7. The profit if selling on day 2 and buying on day 3 would be `10 - 7 - 1 = 2`.
4. On day 4, the price is 3. The profit if selling on day 3 and buying on day 4 would be `7 - 3 - 1 = 3`.

However, the program updates `tem` only when `tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1]`, which means it misses the case where `7 - 3 - 1 = 3` is the maximum profit.

To fix this, the condition should be:
```python
if x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:
    tem = max(tem, x[i] - x[i + 1] - C)
```

This ensures that `tem` is updated to the maximum possible profit correctly.
