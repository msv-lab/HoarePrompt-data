You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The bear decided to store some raspberry for the winter. He cunningly found out the price for a barrel of honey in kilos of raspberry for each of the following n days. According to the bear's data, on the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) day, the price for one barrel of honey is going to is xi kilos of raspberry.

Unfortunately, the bear has neither a honey barrel, nor the raspberry. At the same time, the bear's got a friend who is ready to lend him a barrel of honey for exactly one day for c kilograms of raspberry. That's why the bear came up with a smart plan. He wants to choose some day d (1 ≤ d < n), lent a barrel of honey and immediately (on day d) sell it according to a daily exchange rate. The next day (d + 1) the bear wants to buy a new barrel of honey according to a daily exchange rate (as he's got some raspberry left from selling the previous barrel) and immediately (on day d + 1) give his friend the borrowed barrel of honey as well as c kilograms of raspberry for renting the barrel.

The bear wants to execute his plan at most once and then hibernate. What maximum number of kilograms of raspberry can he earn? Note that if at some point of the plan the bear runs out of the raspberry, then he won't execute such a plan.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers, n and c (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 0 ≤ c ≤ 100), — the number of days and the number of kilos of raspberry that the bear should give for borrowing the barrel.

The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi ≤ 100), the price of a honey barrel on day i.

Output

Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.

Examples

Input

5 1
5 10 7 3 20


Output

3


Input

6 2
100 1 10 40 10 40


Output

97


Input

3 0
1 2 3


Output

0

Note

In the first sample the bear will lend a honey barrel at day 3 and then sell it for 7. Then the bear will buy a barrel for 3 and return it to the friend. So, the profit is (7 - 3 - 1) = 3.

In the second sample bear will lend a honey barrel at day 1 and then sell it for 100. Then the bear buy the barrel for 1 at the day 2. So, the profit is (100 - 1 - 2) = 97.
Program:
```
def func_1():
    string = raw_input()
    (N, C) = string.split(' ')
    N = int(N)
    C = int(C)
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    tem = 0
    for i in range(N):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
    for i in range(len(x) - 1):
        if tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1] and x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:
            tem = x[i] - x[i + 1]
    if tem > 0:
        tem = tem - C
    return tem


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum profit. Specifically, the condition `if tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1] and x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:` is not correctly handling all cases. The issue arises because the program updates `tem` only if the current profit `x[i] - x[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to the previously stored maximum profit `tem`. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 1
5 10 7 3 20
```

The program should output `3`, but it will output `2` due to the flawed logic. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. On day 1, the price is 5.
2. On day 2, the price is 10. The profit if selling on day 1 and buying on day 2 would be `5 - 10 - 1 = -6` (not profitable).
3. On day 3, the price is 7. The profit if selling on day 2 and buying on day 3 would be `10 - 7 - 1 = 2`.
4. On day 4, the price is 3. The profit if selling on day 3 and buying on day 4 would be `7 - 3 - 1 = 3`.

However, the program updates `tem` only when `tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1]`, which means it misses the case where `7 - 3 - 1 = 3` is the maximum profit.

To fix this, the condition should be:
```python
if x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:
    tem = max(tem, x[i] - x[i + 1] - C)
```

This ensures that `tem` is updated to the maximum possible profit correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and c are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ c ≤ 100. x is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ xi ≤ 100, representing the price of a honey barrel on day i.
def func_1():
    string = raw_input()
    N, C = string.split(' ')
    N = int(N)
    C = int(C)
    x = raw_input().split(' ')
    tem = 0
    for i in range(N):
        x[i] = int(x[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first `N` elements are now integers, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `tem` is 0, `i` is `N-1` if `N` > 0, otherwise `i` is undefined.
    for i in range(len(x) - 1):
        if tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1] and x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0:
            tem = x[i] - x[i + 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is `len(x) - 2`, and `tem` is the maximum value of `x[j] - x[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, len(x) - 2]` such that `x[j] - x[j + 1] - C > 0`. If no such `x[j] - x[j + 1]` exists, `tem` remains 0.
    if (tem > 0) :
        tem = tem - C
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is `len(x) - 2`. If `tem` > 0, `tem` is updated to `tem - C`. Otherwise, `tem` remains 0.
    return tem
    #The program returns `tem`, which is 0 if `tem` was not greater than 0, or `tem - C` if `tem` was greater than 0, where `C` is an integer.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
