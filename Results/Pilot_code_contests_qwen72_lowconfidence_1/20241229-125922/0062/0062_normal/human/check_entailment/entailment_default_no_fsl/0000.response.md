Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the maximum profit in certain scenarios. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Profit**:
   - The program uses the variable `tem` to track the maximum difference between consecutive prices (`x[i] - x[i + 1]`). However, it only updates `tem` if the condition `tem <= x[i] - x[i + 1]` and `x[i] - x[i + 1] - C > 0` is met.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider the scenario where the current difference is greater than `tem` but less than `C`. In such cases, the program might miss the correct maximum profit.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where all price differences are less than or equal to `C` correctly. It should return 0 in this case, but the current logic might not always ensure this.

3. **Example Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5 1
     5 10 7 3 20
     ```
     The correct output should be `3` (as described in the problem statement). However, the program might not correctly compute this because it only updates `tem` under specific conditions.

4. **Simplified Example**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3 2
     10 1 10
     ```
     The correct output should be `7` (since the bear can sell on day 1 for 10 and buy on day 2 for 1, resulting in a profit of 10 - 1 - 2 = 7). However, the program might not correctly compute this due to its flawed logic.

To fix these issues, the program should correctly compute the maximum profit by iterating through the prices and keeping track of the maximum profit possible at each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    string = input()
    (N, C) = map(int, string.split(' '))
    x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    max_profit = 0
    for i in range(N - 1):
        profit = x[i] - x[i + 1] - C
        if profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = profit
    return max_profit
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum profit for all potential cases.
