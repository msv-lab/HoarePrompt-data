The code snippet `N = int(N)` converts the string `N` to an integer and assigns it back to `N`.

- `N` was previously the first part of `string` split by space, which means it was a string. Now, it is converted to an integer.
- The other variables (`n`, `c`, `x`, `C`) are not affected by this conversion.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `xi` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer, `C` is the second part of `string` split by space.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `xi` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer, `C` is the second part of `string` split by space.**
