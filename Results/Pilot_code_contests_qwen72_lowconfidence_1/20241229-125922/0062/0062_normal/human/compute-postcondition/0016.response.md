Postcondition: ***`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is 0. If `tem` is less than or equal to `x[0] - x[1]` and `x[0] - x[1] - C` is greater than 0, then `tem` is updated to `x[0] - x[1]`. Otherwise, `tem` remains 0.***
