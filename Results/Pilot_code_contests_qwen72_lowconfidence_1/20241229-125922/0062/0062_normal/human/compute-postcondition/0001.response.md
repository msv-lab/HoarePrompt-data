The code splits the `string` by spaces and assigns the first element to `N` and the second element to `C`. The values of `N` and `C` are now strings derived from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100. `x` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `xi` ≤ 100, representing the price of a honey barrel on day `i`. `N` is the first part of `string` split by space, `C` is the second part of `string` split by space.**
