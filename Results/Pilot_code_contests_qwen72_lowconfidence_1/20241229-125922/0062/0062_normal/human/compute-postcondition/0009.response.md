The value of `x[i]` is converted to an integer using the `int()` function. Since `i` is 1, the second element of the list `x` (index 1) is converted to an integer. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is now an integer and the second element is also an integer, `N` must be greater than 1, `C` is an integer, `tem` is 0, `i` is 1**
