The value of `tem` is updated to the result of the subtraction `x[i] - x[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `tem` will now be equal to `x[1] - x[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is 1, `tem` is `x[1] - x[2]`.
Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is 1, `tem` is `x[1] - x[2]`**
