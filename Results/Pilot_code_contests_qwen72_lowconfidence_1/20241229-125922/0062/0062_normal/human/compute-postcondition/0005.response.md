The line of code `tem = 0` initializes the variable `tem` to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the current state.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list of strings from the input, `N` is an integer, `C` is an integer, `tem` is 0.**
