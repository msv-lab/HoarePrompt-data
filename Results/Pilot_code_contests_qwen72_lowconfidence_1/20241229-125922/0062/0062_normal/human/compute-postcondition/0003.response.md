The code snippet `C = int(C)` converts the variable `C` from a string to an integer. The value of `C` is taken from the second part of a string split by a space. Since the initial state specifies that `C` is the second part of a string split by space, this operation changes `C` from a string to an integer.

The other variables (`n`, `c`, `x`, and `N`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `xi` ≤ 100, `N` is an integer, `C` is an integer.**
