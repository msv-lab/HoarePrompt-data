Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is `len(x) - 2`, and `tem` is the maximum value of `x[j] - x[j + 1]` for all `j` in the range `[0, len(x) - 2]` such that `x[j] - x[j + 1] - C > 0`. If no such `x[j] - x[j + 1]` exists, `tem` remains 0.**
