Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two inputs: a space-separated string containing two integers `N` and `C`, and a space-separated string of `N` integers representing prices. It then processes these inputs to find the maximum difference between consecutive prices (`x[i] - x[i + 1]`) such that the difference minus `C` is greater than 0. If such a difference exists, it returns the maximum difference minus `C`; otherwise, it returns 0. The function assumes valid input where `2 ≤ N ≤ 100`, `0 ≤ C ≤ 100`, and each price `0 ≤ x[i] ≤ 100`. Edge cases include when all price differences are less than or equal to `C`, resulting in a return value of 0. **
