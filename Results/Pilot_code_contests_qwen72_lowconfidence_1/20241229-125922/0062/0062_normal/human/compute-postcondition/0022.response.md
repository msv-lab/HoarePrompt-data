Postcondition: ***`n` and `c` are integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \) and \( 0 \leq c \leq 100 \), `x` is a list with at least 3 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is 2, and `tem` is either 0 or `x[1] - x[2]` based on the previous iteration's condition. If `tem` â‰¤ `x[2] - x[3]` and `x[2] - x[3] - C > 0`, then `tem` is updated to `x[2] - x[3]`. Otherwise, `tem` remains unchanged.***
