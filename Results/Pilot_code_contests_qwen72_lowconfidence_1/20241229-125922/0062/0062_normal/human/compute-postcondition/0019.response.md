Postcondition: ***`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list with at least 2 elements, `N` is a non-negative integer, `C` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `tem` is either 0 or `x[0] - x[1]` based on the previous iteration's condition. If `tem` ≤ `x[1] - x[2]` and `x[1] - x[2] - C > 0`, then `tem` is updated to `x[1] - x[2]`. Otherwise, `tem` remains unchanged.***
