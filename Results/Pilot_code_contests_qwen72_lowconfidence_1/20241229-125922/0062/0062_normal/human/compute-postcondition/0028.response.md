The function `func_1` does not explicitly show any parameters in its definition. However, based on the given context, it seems to use some internal logic or variables (not directly visible from the function signature) that involve `n`, `c`, and `x` as described in the parameter constraints. The output of the function is `tem`, which is adjusted based on a condition: if `tem` is greater than 0, it returns `tem - C`; otherwise, it returns `0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` can be described as follows:
Functionality: **The function implicitly processes a list `x` of `n` integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ xi ≤ 100) and an integer `C` (where 0 ≤ c ≤ 100). It returns `0` if `tem` is not greater than 0, or `tem - C` if `tem` is greater than 0.**
