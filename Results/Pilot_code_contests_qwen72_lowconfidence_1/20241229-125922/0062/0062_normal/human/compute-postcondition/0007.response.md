The code snippet `x[i] = int(x[i])` changes the first element of the list `x` (since `i` is 0) from a string to an integer by converting it using the `int()` function. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is now an integer, `N` must be greater than 0, `C` is an integer, `tem` is 0, `i` is 0**
