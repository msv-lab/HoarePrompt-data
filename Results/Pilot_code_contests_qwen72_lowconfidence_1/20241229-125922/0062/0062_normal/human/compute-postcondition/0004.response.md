The line of code `x = raw_input().split(' ')` reads a string from the input, splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces, and assigns this list to `x`. This means `x` is no longer a list of `n` integers as specified in the initial state but instead a list of strings (substrings from the input).

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list of strings from the input, `N` is an integer, `C` is an integer.**
