The code snippet `x[i] = int(x[i])` casts the third element of the list `x` (since `i` is 2, and indexing in Python starts at 0) to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that the elements of `x` are already integers, this operation does not change the value of `x[2]`. Therefore, the only change is that `x[2]` is explicitly set to its current integer value.

Output State: **`n` and `c` are integers where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ `c` ≤ 100, `x` is a list where the first element is an integer and the second element is an integer, `x[2]` is an integer, `N` must be greater than 2, `C` is an integer, `tem` is 0, `i` is 2**
