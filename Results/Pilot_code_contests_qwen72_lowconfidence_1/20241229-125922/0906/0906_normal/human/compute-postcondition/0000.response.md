`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The new value of `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The conditions for `s` remain unchanged as no operations have been performed on it yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.**
