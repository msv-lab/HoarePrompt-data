The code snippet updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `spend` to it. Let's break down the impact of this operation:

- `total` was initially set to `int(ss[0]) * 20`.
- `spend` is defined as `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

Thus, the new value of `total` will be `int(ss[0]) * 20 + int(ss[0]) * 10`, which simplifies to `int(ss[0]) * 30`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `ss`, `back`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])` and must be greater than 0, `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 30`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.**
