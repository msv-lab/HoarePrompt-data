The code `total += spend` adds the value of `spend` to `total`. This operation changes the value of `total` but does not affect the other variables or conditions specified in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`spend` is the first digit of `ss` multiplied by \(10^{(\text{len(ss)} - 1)}\), `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + 2 * spend`, `s` must be greater than \( \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \), `ss` is the string representation of `s`**.
