The value of `back` is calculated as `spend // 10`. Given that `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, dividing `spend` by 10 will result in `back` being equal to `int(ss[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `total` is 0, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`**
