According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `s` is an input integer, but it is not specified whether this integer is positive. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `s` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
