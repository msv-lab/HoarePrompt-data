`back` is assigned the value of `spend` divided by 10 using integer division. Given that `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, dividing `spend` by 10 results in `int(ss[0])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` must be greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `back` is `int(ss[0])`**
