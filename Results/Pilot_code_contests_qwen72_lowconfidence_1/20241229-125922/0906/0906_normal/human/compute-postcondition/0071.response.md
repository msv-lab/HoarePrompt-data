The function `func` is described with the following parameter constraints: `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters, which seems inconsistent with the description of the parameters `t` and `s`. Assuming the function should indeed take these parameters, the correct function signature should be:

```python
def func(t, s):
```

Given this, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, with each test case involving a positive integer `s` within the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9. The function processes each of the `t` test cases and returns a result for each `s`.

Since the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the problem statement, I will assume that the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (a positive integer representing the number of test cases) and `s` (a positive integer for each test case within the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9). The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
