The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `spend` to it. The value of `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`. Since `total` was initially `int(ss[0]) * 10`, after adding `spend`, `total` becomes `int(ss[0]) * 10 + int(ss[0]) * 10`, which simplifies to `int(ss[0]) * 20`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` must be greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 20`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `back` is `int(ss[0])`**.
