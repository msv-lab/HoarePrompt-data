To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the `while` loop condition:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`.
- `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 20`.
- `ss` is the string representation of `s`.
- `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`.
- `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while s > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `s` is greater than 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is updated to `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be greater than 0 after this update.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Value of `s`:** Let's denote the initial value of `s` before the update as `s_initial`.
2. **Update Rule:** After the update, `s` becomes `s_initial - 9 * int(ss[0])`.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration:** For the loop to execute one more time, the updated value of `s` must be greater than 0:
   \[
   s_initial - 9 * int(ss[0]) > 0
   \]
4. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   \[
   s_initial > 9 * int(ss[0])
   \]

### Conclusion:
- To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `s_initial` must be greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`.
- Since `s` is updated to `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`, we need to ensure that the new value of `s` is still positive.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])` and must be greater than 0.
- `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 20`.
- `ss` is the string representation of `s`.
- `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`.
- `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])` and must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 20`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`**
