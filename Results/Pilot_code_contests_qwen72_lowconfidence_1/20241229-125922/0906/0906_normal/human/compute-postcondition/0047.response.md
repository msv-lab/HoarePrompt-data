To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is 0 or a non-positive value.
   - `total` is the sum of all `spend` values calculated during the iterations, where each `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(t):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes 2.
   - Ensure `t` is greater than 1: `t` must be greater than 1.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `s` remains 0 or a non-positive value.
   - `total` remains the sum of all `spend` values calculated during the iterations, where each `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `s` is 0 or a non-positive value, `total` is the sum of all `spend` values calculated during the iterations, where each `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`**.
