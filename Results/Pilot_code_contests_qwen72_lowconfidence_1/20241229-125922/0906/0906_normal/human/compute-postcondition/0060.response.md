The value of `total` is incremented by `spend`. The other variables, including `back` which is calculated as `spend // 10`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `spend` is calculated as described above, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`spend` is calculated as described above, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, the other variables remain unchanged.**
