The code `back = spend // 10` updates the value of `back`. Given that `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, when we divide `spend` by 10 using integer division (`//`), the result is `int(ss[0])`. Therefore, `back` is now equal to `int(ss[0])`.

Since `back` was already equal to `int(ss[0])` before this operation, the value of `back` remains the same. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])` and must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 20`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.**
