The code snippet `total += spend` updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `spend` to it. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `s` is greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`
- `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`
- `ss` is the string representation of `s`
- `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`
- `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`

Since `total` was initially `int(ss[0]) * 10` and `spend` is also `int(ss[0]) * 10`, the new value of `total` after executing the code snippet is:

\[ \text{new total} = \text{int(ss[0])} * 10 + \text{int(ss[0])} * 10 = \text{int(ss[0])} * 20 \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 20`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.**
