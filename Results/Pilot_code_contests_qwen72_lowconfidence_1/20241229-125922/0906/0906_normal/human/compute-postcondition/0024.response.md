According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `total` is the sum of all `spend` values calculated during the iterations, where each `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`**
