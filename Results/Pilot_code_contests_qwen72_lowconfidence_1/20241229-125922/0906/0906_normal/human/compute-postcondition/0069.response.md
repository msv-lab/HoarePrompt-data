The code snippet `print(total)` prints the value of the variable `total`. The value of `total` is the sum of all `spend` values computed during the loop, but since the actual `spend` values and the loop are not provided, the exact value of `total` cannot be determined. However, the print statement does not change the state of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 0, `total` is the sum of all `spend` values computed during the loop, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`s` is 0, `total` is the sum of all `spend` values computed during the loop, `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2**
