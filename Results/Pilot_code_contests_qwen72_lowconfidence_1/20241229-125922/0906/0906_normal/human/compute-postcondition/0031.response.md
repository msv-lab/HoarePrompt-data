The code `total += spend` updates the value of `total` by adding the value of `spend` to it. Given the initial state, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, and `total` starts at 0. After the execution, `total` will be equal to `spend`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 1
- `s` is greater than 0
- `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`
- `ss` is the string representation of `s`
- `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`
- `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`**
