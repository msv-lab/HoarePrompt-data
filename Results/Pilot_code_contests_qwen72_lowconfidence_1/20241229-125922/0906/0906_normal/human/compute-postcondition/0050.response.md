To determine which states need adjustment for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `s > 0`.

### Current State:
- `t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is the input integer.
- `total` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The condition `s > 0` determines whether the loop will execute.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `total`) do not directly affect the condition of the loop.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s` must be greater than 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `total` do not need to be adjusted as they do not impact the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, `i` is 2, `s` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
