The code snippet updates the value of `spend` to `int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)`. This means that `spend` is now calculated as the first digit of `ss` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the length of `ss` minus one.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`
- `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 20`
- `ss` is the string representation of `s`
- `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`
- `back` is `int(ss[0])`

After executing the code snippet, the updated value of `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 20`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)`, `back` is `int(ss[0])`**
