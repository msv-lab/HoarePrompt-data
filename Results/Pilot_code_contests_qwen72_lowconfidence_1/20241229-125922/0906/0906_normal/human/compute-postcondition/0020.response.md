The value of `total` is updated by adding the value of `spend` to it. Given that `total` is initially `int(ss[0]) * 20` and `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, the new value of `total` becomes `int(ss[0]) * 30`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is `s - 9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is `int(ss[0]) * 30`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`**
