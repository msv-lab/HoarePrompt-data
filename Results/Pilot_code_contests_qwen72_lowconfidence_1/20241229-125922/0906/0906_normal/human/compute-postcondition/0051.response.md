The value of `s` is converted to a string and assigned to the variable `ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again, `i` is 2, `s` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0, `ss` is the string representation of `s`**
