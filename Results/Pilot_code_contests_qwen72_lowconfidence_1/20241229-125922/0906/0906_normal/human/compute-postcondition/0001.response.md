According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this ensures that `t` is at least 1, making the loop executable. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, which is used as the loop counter. For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0.

Additionally, the state mentions `s` as a positive integer for each of the `t` test cases, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `s` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9**
