The code snippet converts the value of `s` into a string and assigns it to the variable `ss`. This operation does not affect the values of `spend`, `back`, `total`, or the condition that `s` must be greater than \( \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \).

Output State: **`spend` is calculated as described, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, `s` must be greater than \( \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \), `ss` is the string representation of `s`**
