The value of `back` is calculated as `spend // 10`. Given that `spend` is defined as `int(ss[0]) * 10`, the value of `spend` is 10 times the integer value of the first character of the string `ss`. Therefore, `back` will be the integer value of the first character of `ss`.

For example, if `s` is 12345, then `ss` is "12345", and `spend` is `int("1") * 10` which equals 10. Thus, `back` is `10 // 10` which equals 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `total` is 0, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `back` is `int(ss[0])`**
