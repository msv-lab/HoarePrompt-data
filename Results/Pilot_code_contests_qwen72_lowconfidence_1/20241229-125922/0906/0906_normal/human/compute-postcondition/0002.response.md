The code snippet assigns a new value to `s` by converting the user input to an integer using `int(input())`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, the new value of `s` will also be a positive integer within this range. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9**
