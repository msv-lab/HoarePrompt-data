The value of `s` is converted to a string and assigned to the variable `ss`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `total` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, `total` is 0, `ss` is the string representation of `s`**
