To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the given state:

The loop condition is `s > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `spend` is calculated as described (though the exact formula is not provided, we know it has been calculated).
- `back` is `spend // 10`.
- `total` is updated to `total + spend`.
- `s` is updated to `s - spend + back`.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must be positive after the updates. Since `s` is updated to `s - spend + back`, we need to ensure that this expression results in a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be such that:
\[ s - \text{spend} + \text{back} > 0 \]

Given that `back` is `spend // 10`, this means:
\[ s - \text{spend} + \frac{\text{spend}}{10} > 0 \]
\[ s - \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} > 0 \]
\[ s > \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \]

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than \( \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \).

State: **`spend` is calculated as described, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, `s` must be greater than \( \frac{9 \times \text{spend}}{10} \)**
