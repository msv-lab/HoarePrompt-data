The value of `back` is updated to be `spend // 10`. Given that `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, dividing `spend` by 10 results in `int(ss[0])`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `s` is greater than `9 * int(ss[0])`, `total` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`, `ss` is the string representation of `s`, `back` is equal to `int(ss[0])`, `spend` is equal to `int(ss[0]) * 10`.**
