The code `s = s - spend + back` updates the value of `s`. Initially, `spend` is calculated as described, `back` is `spend // 10`, and `total` is updated to `total + spend`. The new value of `s` is `s - spend + back`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `spend` is calculated as described, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, `s` is `s - spend + back`.
Output State: **`spend` is calculated as described, `back` is `spend // 10`, `total` is `total + spend`, `s` is `s - spend + back`**
