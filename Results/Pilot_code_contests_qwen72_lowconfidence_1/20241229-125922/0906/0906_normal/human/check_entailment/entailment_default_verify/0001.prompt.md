You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. 

Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 ≤ x ≤ s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain ⌊x/10⌋ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains ⌊x/10⌋ back). The operation ⌊a/b⌋ means a divided by b rounded down.

It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.

Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.

Output

For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = int(input())
        total = 0
        while s > 0:
            ss = str(s)
            spend = int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)
            back = spend // 10
            total += spend
            s = s - spend + back
        print(total)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the way it calculates the amount to spend (`spend = int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)`) is flawed. This approach assumes that Mishka will always spend the largest possible multiple of 10 that fits into `s`, which is not necessarily optimal.

For example, consider the case where `s = 19`:
- According to the program:
  - First iteration: `s = 19`, `spend = 10`, `back = 1`, `total = 10`, `s = 10`.
  - Second iteration: `s = 10`, `spend = 10`, `back = 1`, `total = 20`, `s = 1`.
  - Third iteration: `s = 1`, `spend = 0` (since `spend` is calculated as `1 * 10 ** 0 = 1`, but `s` is already 1), `total = 20`.

The program incorrectly outputs `20` instead of the correct answer `21`. The correct sequence should be:
- First iteration: `s = 19`, `spend = 10`, `back = 1`, `total = 10`, `s = 10`.
- Second iteration: `s = 10`, `spend = 10`, `back = 1`, `total = 20`, `s = 1`.
- Third iteration: `s = 1`, `spend = 1`, `back = 0`, `total = 21`, `s = 0`.

Thus, the program does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads another integer `s` (where `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9`). The function then calculates a total value by repeatedly spending and adjusting the value of `s` until `s` becomes 0 or a non-positive value. Specifically, in each iteration, it calculates `spend` as the first digit of `s` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the length of `s` minus one, adds `spend` to `total`, and updates `s` by subtracting `spend` and adding back `spend // 10`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the `total` value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is 0 or a non-positive value for each test case, and `total` is the sum of all `spend` values for each test case. Edge cases include when `s` is a single-digit number or when `s` is exactly a power of 10.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
