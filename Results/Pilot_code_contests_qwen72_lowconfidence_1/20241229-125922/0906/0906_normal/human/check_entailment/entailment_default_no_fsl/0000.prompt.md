You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. 

Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 ≤ x ≤ s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain ⌊x/10⌋ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains ⌊x/10⌋ back). The operation ⌊a/b⌋ means a divided by b rounded down.

It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.

Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.

Output

For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

Program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = int(input())
        total = 0
        while s > 0:
            ss = str(s)
            spend = int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)
            back = spend // 10
            total += spend
            s = s - spend + back
        print(total)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads another integer `s` (where `1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9`). The function then calculates a total value by repeatedly spending and adjusting the value of `s` until `s` becomes 0 or a non-positive value. Specifically, in each iteration, it calculates `spend` as the first digit of `s` multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the length of `s` minus one, adds `spend` to `total`, and updates `s` by subtracting `spend` and adding back `spend // 10`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the `total` value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is 0 or a non-positive value for each test case, and `total` is the sum of all `spend` values for each test case. Edge cases include when `s` is a single-digit number or when `s` is exactly a power of 10.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
