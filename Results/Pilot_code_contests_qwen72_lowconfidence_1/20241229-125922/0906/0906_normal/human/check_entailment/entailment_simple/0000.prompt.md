You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. 

Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 ≤ x ≤ s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain ⌊x/10⌋ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains ⌊x/10⌋ back). The operation ⌊a/b⌋ means a divided by b rounded down.

It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.

Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.

Output

For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, s is a positive integer where 1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = int(input())
        
        total = 0
        
        while s > 0:
            ss = str(s)
            spend = int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)
            back = spend // 10
            total += spend
            s = s - spend + back
        
        print(total)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is 0 or a non-positive value for each test case, `total` is the sum of all `spend` values calculated during the iterations for each test case, where each `spend` is `int(ss[0]) * 10

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
