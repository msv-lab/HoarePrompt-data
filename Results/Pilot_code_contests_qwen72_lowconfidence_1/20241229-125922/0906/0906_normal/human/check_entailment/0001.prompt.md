You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. 

Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 ≤ x ≤ s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain ⌊x/10⌋ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains ⌊x/10⌋ back). The operation ⌊a/b⌋ means a divided by b rounded down.

It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.

Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.

Output

For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

        while s > 0:
            ss = str(s)
            spend = int(ss[0]) * 10 ** (len(ss) - 1)
            back = spend // 10
            total += spend
            s = s - spend + back
        print(total)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
