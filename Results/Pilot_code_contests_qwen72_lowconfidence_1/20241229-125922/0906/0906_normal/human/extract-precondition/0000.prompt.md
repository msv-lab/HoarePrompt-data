You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has s burles on his card. 

Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number 1 ≤ x ≤ s, buy food that costs exactly x burles and obtain ⌊x/10⌋ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends x burles and obtains ⌊x/10⌋ back). The operation ⌊a/b⌋ means a divided by b rounded down.

It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs x for any possible value of x.

Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.

For example, if Mishka has s=19 burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is 21. Firstly, he can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback. Now he has s=10 burles, so can spend x=10 burles, obtain 1 burle as a cashback and spend it too.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The next t lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 10^9) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.

Output

For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.
