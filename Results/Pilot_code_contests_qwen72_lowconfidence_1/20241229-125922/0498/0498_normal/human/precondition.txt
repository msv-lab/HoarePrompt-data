n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), representing the number of points. Each point (x, y) is represented by two non-negative integers (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100 000), and all points are distinct. Additionally, if a point (x, y) is present, then all points (x', y') such that 0 ≤ x' ≤ x and 0 ≤ y' ≤ y are also present. The list w contains n integers ( - 100 000 ≤ wi ≤ 100 000) representing the required special values for the aesthetically pleasing numbering.
