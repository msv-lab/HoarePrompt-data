Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of points `n` and the points themselves, storing them in a list `a`.
   - It also reads the special values `w` for each point.

2. **Grouping Points by Special Value:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` object `mem` to count the occurrences of each special value in `w`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` of lists `mem2` to group points by their special value (`y - x`).

3. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the number of points with each special value in `mem2` matches the count in `mem`. If not, it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - This ensures that the required special values are present in the correct quantities.

4. **Sorting and Labeling:**
   - The points in each group are sorted in descending order of their coordinates.
   - The program assigns labels to the points in a way that respects the aesthetically pleasing condition. Specifically, it ensures that for each point `(x, y)` labeled with `i`, all points `(x', y')` with `x' ≥ x` and `y' ≥ y` are labeled with a number not less than `i`.

5. **Output:**
   - If all conditions are met, the program prints 'YES' followed by the coordinates of the points in the correct order.
   - If any condition is violated, the program prints 'NO' and exits.

### Key Points:
- **Special Value Grouping:** The program correctly groups points by their special value and ensures the counts match the required special values.
- **Sorting:** The points are sorted in descending order to ensure the aesthetically pleasing condition.
- **Labeling:** The program correctly labels the points and checks the conditions to ensure the labeling is valid.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles the input constraints as specified and ensures that the conditions are met for all valid inputs.

Given that the program follows the problem description and handles all valid cases correctly, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
