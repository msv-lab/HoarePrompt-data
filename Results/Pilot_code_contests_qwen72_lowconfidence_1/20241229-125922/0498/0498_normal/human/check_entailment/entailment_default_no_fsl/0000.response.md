Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically in how it initializes and uses the `labels` array and in the boundary conditions for checking adjacent points.

1. **Initialization of `labels`:**
   - The `labels` array is initialized as a 1000x1000 grid, which is hardcoded and may not be sufficient for larger inputs (e.g., when coordinates are close to 100,000). This can lead to out-of-bounds errors for large inputs.

2. **Boundary Conditions for Checking Adjacent Points:**
   - The code checks if `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]`. However, this check assumes that the points `(x + 1, y)` and `(x, y + 1)` are always within the bounds of the `labels` array. If these points are out of bounds, it can lead to incorrect results or errors.
   - For example, if the point `(x, y)` is on the boundary of the grid (e.g., `x = 999` or `y = 999`), the code will attempt to access `labels[1000][y]` or `labels[x][1000]`, which are out of bounds.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where the input points are at the boundaries of the coordinate system (e.g., `x = 100000` or `y = 100000`). This can lead to incorrect results or errors.

To ensure the program works correctly for every potential case, the following changes are necessary:
- Initialize the `labels` array dynamically based on the maximum coordinates in the input.
- Add boundary checks to ensure that the points being accessed are within the bounds of the `labels` array.

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

```python
from sys import stdin
from collections import *

rints = lambda : [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
(n, points) = (int(input()), [rints() for _ in range(n)])
w = rints()

def func_1():
    max_x = max(y[0] for y in points)
    max_y = max(y[1] for y in points)
    labels = [[0 for _ in range(max_y + 1)] for _ in range(max_x + 1)]
    mem = Counter(w)
    mem2 = defaultdict(list)
    out = []
    
    for (x, y) in points:
        mem2[y - x].append([x, y])
    
    for (i, j) in mem.items():
        if len(mem2[i]) != j:
            print('NO')
            exit()
        mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)
    
    for i in range(n):
        (x, y) = mem2[w[i]][-1]
        labels[x][y] = i + 1
        if i > 0:
            if x + 1 <= max_x and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]:
                print('NO')
                exit()
            if y + 1 <= max_y and labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]:
                print('NO')
                exit()
        out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))
    
    print('YES')
    print('\n'.join(out))

func_1()
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
