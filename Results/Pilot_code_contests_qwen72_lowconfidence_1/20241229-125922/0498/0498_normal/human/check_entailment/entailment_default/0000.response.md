Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically when dealing with the labeling of points. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Incorrect Labeling Check**: The code checks the labeling condition using `labels[x + 1][y]` and `labels[x][y + 1]`, which can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect comparisons. The correct condition should be to check the labels of all points that are greater than or equal to the current point's coordinates.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The code does not handle edge cases where the points are at the boundary of the grid. For example, if a point is at `(0, 0)`, checking `labels[x + 1][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1]` will be out of bounds.

3. **Sorting and Grouping**: The sorting and grouping logic is correct, but the labeling and validation logic is flawed. The code should ensure that all points with the same special value are labeled in a way that maintains the aesthetic condition.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

- **Out-of-Bounds Error**: The code uses `labels[x + 1][y]` and `labels[x][y + 1]` to check the labeling condition. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors if the point is at the boundary of the grid. For example, if a point is at `(0, 0)`, `labels[1][0]` and `labels[0][1]` will be out of bounds.

- **Incorrect Labeling Validation**: The code should validate the labeling condition by ensuring that for each point `(x, y)`, all points `(x', y')` such that `x' ≥ x` and `y' ≥ y` have labels not less than the label of `(x, y)`. The current implementation does not fully capture this condition.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1
```

The code will correctly output this for the given example. However, consider the following edge case:

**Input:**
```
4
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

The code will incorrectly output:
```
YES
0 0
0 1
1 0
1 1
```

This is because the code does not correctly validate the labeling condition for all points. Specifically, the point `(1, 1)` should not be labeled with a number less than or equal to the label of `(1, 0)` or `(0, 1)`.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
