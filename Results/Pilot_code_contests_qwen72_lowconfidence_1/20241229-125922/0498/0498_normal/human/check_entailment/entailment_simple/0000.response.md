Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding an aesthetically pleasing numbering of points in a set such that the special value \( s(x, y) = y - x \) matches the given sequence \( w \). However, there are several issues in the implementation that prevent it from correctly solving the problem in all cases.

1. **Incorrect Handling of Aesthetic Constraints**:
   - The program checks if the numbering is aesthetically pleasing by comparing the labels of adjacent points (`labels[x + 1][y]` and `labels[x][y + 1]`). However, this check is insufficient because it only considers immediate neighbors. The problem requires that for any point \((x, y)\) with label \(i\), all points \((x', y')\) such that \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must have labels not less than \(i\). This means the program should ensure that for any point \((x, y)\) with label \(i\), all points \((x', y')\) in the set where \(x' \geq x\) and \(y' \geq y\) must have labels \(\geq i\).

2. **Incorrect Use of `labels` Array**:
   - The `labels` array is initialized as a 1000x1000 grid, which is not necessary given the constraints (points can have coordinates up to 100,000). More importantly, the program updates `labels[x][y]` but does not correctly handle the case where the coordinates exceed the bounds of the `labels` array. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect labeling.

3. **Handling of Special Values**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each special value in `w` and a `defaultdict` to group points by their special values. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the special values in `w` do not match the special values of the points in the set. Specifically, it checks if the length of `mem2[i]` matches the count in `mem`, but it does not ensure that the points in `mem2[i]` can be assigned the labels in `w` in a way that satisfies the aesthetic constraints.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the result in the correct format if a solution exists, but it may incorrectly determine that a solution exists when it does not, due to the issues mentioned above.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
5
2 0
0 0
1 0
1 1
0 1
0 -1 -2 1 0
```
The program should output:
```
YES
0 0
1 0
2 0
0 1
1 1
```
However, due to the issues mentioned, the program might incorrectly label the points or fail to correctly check the aesthetic constraints, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the numbering is aesthetically pleasing and that the special values match the given sequence `w`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
