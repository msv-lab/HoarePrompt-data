The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `mem2[w[i]]` to the variables `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order
- `out` is a list containing two elements: the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped, and the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before it was popped
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points
- For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`
- `i` is 2
- `x` and `y` are the second-to-last element of the list `mem2[w[1]]`
- `labels[x][y]` is 2
- If `i` is true and either `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]`, the program terminates with no changes to the state. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state.

After executing the code:
- `x` and `y` are assigned the last element of the list `mem2[w[2]]`

The rest of the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is a list containing two elements: the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped, and the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before it was popped, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[2]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 2, if `i` is true and either `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]`, the program terminates with no changes to the state. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state.**
