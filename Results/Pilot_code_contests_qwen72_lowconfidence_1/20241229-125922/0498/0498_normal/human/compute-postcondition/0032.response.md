The code `out.append(' '.join(map(str, mem2[w[i]].pop())))` performs the following actions:

1. It accesses the list stored in `mem2` at the key `w[i]`.
2. It pops the last element from this list (since lists are popped from the end by default).
3. It converts each element of the popped list to a string.
4. It joins these string elements into a single string separated by spaces.
5. It appends this joined string to the list `out`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order.
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points
- For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`
- `i` is 0
- `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`
- `labels[x][y]` is 1
- The condition `(i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` is false, so the program continues with no changes to the variables.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `out` now contains one element, which is the string representation of the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`, with the elements separated by spaces.
- The list `mem2[w[0]]` has had its last element removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is a list containing one element which is the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the second-to-last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]` (if the list had more than one element), `labels[x][y]` is 1.**
