The code `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])` appends the point pair `[x, y]` to the list stored in `mem2` at the key `y - x`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` is a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 2 points.
- (x, y) is the second point pair in the list `a`.

The code updates `mem2` by appending the point pair `[x, y]` to the list at the key `y - x`. Since `(x, y)` is the second point pair in the list `a`, this operation will add `[x, y]` to the list associated with the key `y - x` in `mem2`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` now includes `[x, y]` as its last element.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 2 points.
- (x, y) is the second point pair in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` now includes `[x, y]` as its last element, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 2 points, (x, y) is the second point pair in the list `a`**.
