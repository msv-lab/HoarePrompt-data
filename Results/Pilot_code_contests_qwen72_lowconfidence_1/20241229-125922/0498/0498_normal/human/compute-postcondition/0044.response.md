The `exit()` function is called, which immediately terminates the program without making any changes to the variables or their values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is a list containing two elements: the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped, and the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[1]]` before it was popped, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[2]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 3, if `i` is true and either `labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y]` or `labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y]`, the program terminates with no changes to the state. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state.**
