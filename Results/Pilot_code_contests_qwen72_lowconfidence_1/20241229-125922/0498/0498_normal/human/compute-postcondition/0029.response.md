The provided Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This code simply prints the string 'NO' and does not modify any of the variables or data structures in the initial state.

Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged from the Initial State, except that the string 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 1, and the condition `(i and labels[x + 1][y] < labels[x][y] or labels[x][y + 1] < labels[x][y])` is true. The string 'NO' has been printed.**
