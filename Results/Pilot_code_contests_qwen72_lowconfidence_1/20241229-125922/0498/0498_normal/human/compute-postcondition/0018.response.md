The code snippet `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order. Since the precondition already states that `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order, this operation does not change the state of `mem2[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w` and must be non-empty, `i` is the second key in `mem`, `j` is the corresponding value in `mem`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order. `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points. If the length of the list `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, the program has terminated. Otherwise, the program continues executing.**
