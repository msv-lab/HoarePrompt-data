The code `labels[x][y] = i + 1` updates the value of `labels[x][y]` to `i + 1`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order
- `out` is a list containing one element which is the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points
- For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`
- `i` is 1
- `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[1]]`
- `labels[x][y]` is 1

The impact of the code `labels[x][y] = i + 1` is:
- `labels[x][y]` is updated to `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is a list containing one element which is the string representation of the last element of `mem2[w[0]]` before it was popped, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem` minus one for `i == w[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[1]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 2.**
