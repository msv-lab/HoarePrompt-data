The code `mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `mem2[i]` in descending order.

- `mem2[i]` is a list of all `[x, y]` pairs from `a` that have the same difference `y - x` equal to `i`.
- Sorting this list in reverse order means that the pairs will be ordered from the pair with the highest `y` value to the lowest `y` value, assuming `y` values are distinct or from the pair with the highest combined value of `[x, y]` to the lowest if there are ties.

Since the sorting operation only affects the order of elements in `mem2[i]` and does not change the values of other variables, the output state remains largely unchanged except for the sorted order of `mem2[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w` and must be non-empty, `i` is the first key in `mem`, `j` is the corresponding value in `mem`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. `mem2[i]` is now sorted in descending order. `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points. If the length of the list `mem2[i]` is not equal to `j`, the program has terminated.**
