To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given information:

- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- The list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`.
- `out` is an empty list.
- The loop iterates over the list `a`, which is not explicitly defined but is implied to be a list of point pairs (x, y).

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The list `a` must contain at least one point pair (x, y).
2. The variable `(x, y)` should be initialized to the first point pair in the list `a`.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, the list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 1 point, (x, y) is the first point pair in the list `a`**.
