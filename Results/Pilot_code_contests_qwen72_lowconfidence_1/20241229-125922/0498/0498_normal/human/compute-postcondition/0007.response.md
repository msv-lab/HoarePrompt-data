Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points.**
