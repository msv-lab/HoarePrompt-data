The code snippet `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])` appends the point pair `[x, y]` to the list associated with the key `y - x` in the `defaultdict` `mem2`. This operation modifies the `mem2` dictionary but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` now includes `[x, y]` as its last element
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 3 points
- (x, y) is the third point pair in the list `a`

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` now includes `[x, y]` as its last two elements (the original last element and the newly appended `[x, y]`)
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 3 points
- (x, y) is the third point pair in the list `a`

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` now includes `[x, y]` as its last two elements, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 3 points, (x, y) is the third point pair in the list `a`**
