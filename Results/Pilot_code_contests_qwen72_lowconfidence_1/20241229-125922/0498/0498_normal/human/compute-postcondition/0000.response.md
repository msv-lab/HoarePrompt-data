The code initializes three variables: `mem`, `mem2`, and `out`. 

- `mem` is initialized as a `Counter` object from the `collections` module, which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `w`.
- `mem2` is initialized as a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module with a default type of `list`, which means that accessing a non-existent key will return an empty list.
- `out` is initialized as an empty list.

The initial state remains unchanged except for these new variable assignments.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000; the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct; the list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000; `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`; `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`; `out` is an empty list.**
