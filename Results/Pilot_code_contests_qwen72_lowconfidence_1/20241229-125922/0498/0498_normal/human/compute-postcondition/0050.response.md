The function `func_1` seems to be missing the parameters in the provided definition. Based on the given parameter constraints, I will assume the function should accept the following parameters:

- `n`: An integer representing the number of points, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- `points`: A list of tuples, each containing two integers (x, y), representing the coordinates of the points, where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- `w`: A list of integers of length `n`, representing special values associated with each point, where -100,000 ≤ wi ≤ 100,000.

Given these assumptions, the function could be defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(n, points, w):
```

Output: The output is not specified in the provided information. However, based on typical problem statements involving points and special values, the function might return a value or a set of values derived from the points and their associated special values. Without further context, I will describe the general functionality assuming a common output scenario:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer indicating the number of points), `points` (a list of tuples representing the coordinates of the points), and `w` (a list of integers representing special values associated with each point). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the points and their associated special values.**

If you can provide more specific details about the expected output, I can refine the description accordingly.
