The `exit()` function call terminates the program immediately. This means no further execution occurs after this point, and the program does not continue to process any subsequent code. The state of the variables before the `exit()` call remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w` and must be non-empty, `i` is the second key in `mem`, `j` is the corresponding value in `mem`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. `mem2[i]` is now sorted in descending order. `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points. The program has terminated.**
