To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to consider the effects of the loop on the variables involved and the conditions under which the loop terminates.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `points` are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 100,000\), and all points are distinct.
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\).
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i, j in mem.items():
    if len(mem2[i]) != j:
        print('NO')
        exit()
    mem2[i].sort(reverse=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each key-value pair `(i, j)` in the `mem` dictionary.
   - For each key `i` in `mem`, the loop checks if the length of the list `mem2[i]` is equal to the value `j` in `mem`.
   - If the lengths do not match, the program prints 'NO' and exits.
   - If the lengths match, the list `mem2[i]` is sorted in descending order.

2. **Final State**:
   - If the loop completes without exiting, it means that for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`.
   - After the loop, each list in `mem2` will be sorted in descending order.

### Output State:
- `n` remains an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `w` remains a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\).
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order.
- `out` remains an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points.
- The program does not terminate with 'NO' if the loop completes, meaning that for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order. `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, and for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`.**
