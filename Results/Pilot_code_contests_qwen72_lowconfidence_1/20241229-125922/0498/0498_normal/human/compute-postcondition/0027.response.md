The given code snippet modifies the `labels` array at the position `[x][y]` by setting its value to `i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\)
- `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\)
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order
- `out` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points
- For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`
- `i` is 0
- `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`

The code `labels[x][y] = i + 1` updates the `labels` array at the position `[x][y]` to 1, since `i` is 0 and `i + 1` equals 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`, `labels[x][y]` is 1**
