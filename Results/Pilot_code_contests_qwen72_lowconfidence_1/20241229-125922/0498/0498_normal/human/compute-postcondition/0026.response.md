The code snippet assigns the last element of the list `mem2[w[i]]` to the variables `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

1. **Initial State Recap**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
   - `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points.
   - For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `x, y = mem2[w[i]][-1]` accesses the last element of the list `mem2[w[i]]` and unpacks it into `x` and `y`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `x` and `y` are now assigned the last element of the list `mem2[w[i]]`.
   - The value of `i` remains 0.
   - All other variables (`n`, `w`, `mem`, `mem2`, `out`, `a`) remain unchanged.

4. **Specific Values**:
   - Since `i` is 0, `w[i]` is `w[0]`.
   - Let's denote `w[0]` as `k`. The value of `k` is within the range \(-100,000 \leq k \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem2[k]` is a list of [x, y] pairs that have the difference `k`.
   - The last element of `mem2[k]` is `[x, y]`, which is now assigned to `x` and `y`.

5. **Output State**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\).
   - `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
   - `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order.
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points.
   - For every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where \(-100,000 \leq w_i \leq 100,000\), `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and for each (x, y) in `a`, `mem2[y - x]` contains the list of all [x, y] pairs that have the same difference `y - x`. Each list in `mem2` is sorted in descending order, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least `n` points, for every key `i` in `mem`, the length of `mem2[i]` is equal to the corresponding value `j` in `mem`, `i` is 0, `x` and `y` are the last element of the list `mem2[w[0]]`.**
