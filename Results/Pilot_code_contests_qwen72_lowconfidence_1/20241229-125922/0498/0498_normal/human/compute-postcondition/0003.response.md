To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- The list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` is a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 1 point.
- `(x, y)` is the first point pair in the list `a`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (x, y) in a:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a`.
2. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will move to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The current state needs to reflect the new point pair `(x, y)` being processed.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop has already processed the first point pair `(x, y)`, the next point pair in the list `a` will be the second one.
- The list `a` must have at least 2 point pairs for the loop to execute one more time.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000.
- The points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct.
- The list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000.
- `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`.
- `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list`, and `mem2[y - x]` is a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element.
- `out` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 2 points.
- `(x, y)` is the second point pair in the list `a`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, the list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list` and `mem2[y - x]` is a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 2 points, (x, y) is the second point pair in the list `a`**
