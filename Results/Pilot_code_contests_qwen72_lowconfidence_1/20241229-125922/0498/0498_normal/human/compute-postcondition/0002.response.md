The code snippet `mem2[y - x].append([x, y])` impacts the `mem2` defaultdict by appending the point `[x, y]` to the list associated with the key `y - x`. Let's break down the changes:

- The key `y - x` in `mem2` now has a new list or an updated list with `[x, y]` appended to it.
- The value of `mem2[y - x]` is now a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element.

All other variables (`n`, `w`, `mem`, `out`, `a`) remain unchanged, and the properties of `a` (having at least one point and `(x, y)` being the first point pair) remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, the points are described by pairs of integers (x, y) where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100,000, and all points are distinct, the list of special values `w` is a list of integers of length `n` where -100,000 ≤ `wi` ≤ 100,000, `mem` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `w`, `mem2` is a `defaultdict` with a default type of `list` and `mem2[y - x]` is a list that includes `[x, y]` as its last element, `out` is an empty list, `a` is a list of point pairs (x, y) that must have at least 1 point, (x, y) is the first point pair in the list `a`**
