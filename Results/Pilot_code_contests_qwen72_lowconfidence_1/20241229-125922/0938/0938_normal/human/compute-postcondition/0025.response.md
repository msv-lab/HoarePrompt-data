The provided Python code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the string `'POSSIBLE'`. This operation does not alter the values of any variables in the initial state. The conditions and values of `N`, `K`, `A`, `tmp`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`, `flag` is `True`, and 'POSSIBLE' is printed.**
