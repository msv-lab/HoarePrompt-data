Postcondition: **`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`, and `flag` is `True`. There exists an element `a` in `A` such that `a == K` or `(K - a) % tmp == 0`.**
