The code snippet `tmp = reduce(gcd, A)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `A` using the `reduce` function from the `functools` module and the `gcd` function from the `math` module. The result is stored in the variable `tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is the first integer input.
- `K` is the second integer input.
- `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element `A_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `A_i` ≤ 10^9, and the list is sorted in ascending order.
- `K` is less than or equal to `A[-1]`.
- `flag` is True.

After executing the code:
- `tmp` is assigned the GCD of all elements in the list `A`.
- The values of `N`, `K`, `A`, and `flag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, K is less than or equal to A[-1], flag is True, tmp is the GCD of all elements in A.**
