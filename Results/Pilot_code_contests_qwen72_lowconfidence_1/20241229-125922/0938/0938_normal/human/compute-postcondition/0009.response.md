Postcondition: ***N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, K is less than or equal to A[-1], and tmp is the GCD of all elements in A. If tmp is not 1, flag is False. Otherwise, flag remains True.***
