Postcondition: ***`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \). If `K` is greater than the last element of `A` (i.e., `A[-1]`), 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. Otherwise, `K` is less than or equal to `A[-1]`, and `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`. If `flag` is `True`, 'POSSIBLE' is printed. If `flag` is `False`, no message is printed.***
