Postcondition: ***N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), K is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), tmp is the GCD of all elements in A, A must have at least one element (N must be at least 1), a is the next element in A. If `a == K` or `(K - a) % tmp == 0`, then flag is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the flag remains False.***
