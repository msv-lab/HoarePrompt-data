The code snippet sets the variable `flag` to `True`. This overrides any previous value of `flag`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`, `A` must have at least one element remaining, `a` is the next element in `A`, `flag` is `True`**
