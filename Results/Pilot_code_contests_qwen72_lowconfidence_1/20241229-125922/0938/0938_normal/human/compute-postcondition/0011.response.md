Postcondition: **N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), K is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), tmp is the GCD of all elements in A, flag is False if tmp is not 1, otherwise flag remains True, and A must have at least one element (N must be at least 1). Additionally, either \( a \) equals \( K \) or \( (K - a) \% \text{tmp} \) equals 0.**
