The code prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and does not alter any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the action of printing 'IMPOSSIBLE'.

Output State: **N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is now a sorted list of N integers, where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, and the list is sorted in ascending order. Additionally, K is greater than the last element of A (A[-1]). 'IMPOSSIBLE' has been printed.**
