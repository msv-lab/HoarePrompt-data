The value of `flag` is set to `False`. The other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`, `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, K is less than or equal to A[-1], flag is False, tmp is the GCD of all elements in A, and the current value of tmp is not 1.**
