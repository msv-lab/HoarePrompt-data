The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from the standard input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then checks whether it is possible to form the integer `K` by adding or subtracting multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A`. If `K` is greater than the largest element in `A`, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, if `K` can be formed as described, the function prints 'POSSIBLE'; otherwise, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing the result. The function handles edge cases where `K` is outside the range of elements in `A` or where the GCD of `A` is not 1.
