Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully adhere to the problem description and fails in certain scenarios. Hereâ€™s the detailed reasoning:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The code uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. This would cause the code to fail in a Python 3 environment, which is more commonly used today.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The code calculates the GCD of the entire list `A` using `reduce(gcd, A)`. While this is generally correct, it assumes that the GCD of the list is a key factor in determining if `K` can be formed. However, the problem requires checking if `K` can be formed by taking the absolute difference of any two numbers in the list, which is a more complex operation.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code checks if `K` is greater than the maximum element in `A` and immediately prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. This is incorrect because it is possible to form a number larger than the maximum element in `A` through repeated operations. For example, if `A = [1, 2]` and `K = 3`, the operation can produce `3` by taking the absolute difference of `1` and `2`.

4. **GCD Condition**: The code checks if `(K - a) % tmp == 0` for any `a` in `A`. This condition is not sufficient to ensure that `K` can be formed. The correct approach involves checking if `K` is within the range of possible values that can be formed by the GCD of the elements in `A`.

5. **Algorithmic Correctness**: The algorithm should consider the properties of the GCD and the fact that any number that can be formed by the operations must be a multiple of the GCD of the initial set of numbers. The current implementation does not fully capture this property.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
