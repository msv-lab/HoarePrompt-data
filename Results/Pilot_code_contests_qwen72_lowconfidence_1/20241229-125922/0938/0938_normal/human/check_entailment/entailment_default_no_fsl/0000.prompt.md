You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a box containing N balls. The i-th ball has the integer A_i written on it. Snuke can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Take out two balls from the box. Then, return them to the box along with a new ball, on which the absolute difference of the integers written on the two balls is written.



Determine whether it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

If it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written, print `POSSIBLE`; if it is not possible, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

Program:
```
from fractions import gcd

def func():
    (N, K) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    if K > A[-1]:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
    else:
        flag = True
        tmp = reduce(gcd, A)
        if tmp != 1:
            flag = False
        for a in A:
            if a == K or (K - a) % tmp == 0:
                flag = True
                break
        if flag:
            print('POSSIBLE')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from the standard input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then checks whether it is possible to form the integer `K` by adding or subtracting multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A`. If `K` is greater than the largest element in `A`, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, if `K` can be formed as described, the function prints 'POSSIBLE'; otherwise, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing the result. The function handles edge cases where `K` is outside the range of elements in `A` or where the GCD of `A` is not 1.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
