You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a box containing N balls. The i-th ball has the integer A_i written on it. Snuke can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Take out two balls from the box. Then, return them to the box along with a new ball, on which the absolute difference of the integers written on the two balls is written.



Determine whether it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

Output

If it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written, print `POSSIBLE`; if it is not possible, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

    else:
        flag = True
        tmp = reduce(gcd, A)
        if tmp != 1:
            flag = False
        for a in A:
            if a == K or (K - a) % tmp == 0:
                flag = True
                break
        if flag:
            print('POSSIBLE')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the target value `K` can be reached is flawed. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
2 5
10 15
```

### Expected Output:
```
POSSIBLE
```

### Actual Output:
```
IMPOSSIBLE
```

### Explanation:
In this case, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array `[10, 15]` is `5`. Since `K = 5` and `5` is a multiple of the GCD, it should be possible to reach `K` by performing the operations described. However, the program incorrectly prints `IMPOSSIBLE`.

The issue lies in the logic that checks if `K` can be reached. The program uses the condition `(K - a) % tmp == 0` to check if `K` can be reached, but this condition is not sufficient to cover all cases. Specifically, the program should also consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the numbers and the target `K` to ensure that the operations can indeed produce the desired result.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9, and A is a list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    N, K = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    if (K > A[-1]) :
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
    else :
        flag = True
        tmp = reduce(gcd, A)
        if (tmp != 1) :
            flag = False
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, K is less than or equal to A[-1], and tmp is the GCD of all elements in A. If tmp is not 1, flag is False. Otherwise, flag remains True.
        for a in A:
            if a == K or (K - a) % tmp == 0:
                flag = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`, and `flag` is `True` if there exists an element `a` in `A` such that `a == K` or `(K - a) % tmp == 0`; otherwise, `flag` is `False`.
        if flag :
            print('POSSIBLE')
        else :
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`. If `flag` is `True`, 'POSSIBLE' is printed. If `flag` is `False`, no message is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \). If `K` is greater than the last element of `A` (i.e., `A[-1]`), 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. Otherwise, `K` is less than or equal to `A[-1]`, and `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`. If `flag` is `True`, 'POSSIBLE' is printed. If `flag` is `False`, no message is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from the standard input, followed by a list of `N` integers `A`. It then checks whether it is possible to form the integer `K` by adding or subtracting multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `A`. If `K` is greater than the largest element in `A`, the function prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. Otherwise, if `K` can be formed as described, the function prints 'POSSIBLE'; otherwise, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by printing the result. The function handles edge cases where `K` is outside the range of elements in `A` or where the GCD of `A` is not 1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
