Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle a specific edge case correctly. Consider the following input:

```
2 3
1 2
```

For this input, the correct output should be `POSSIBLE` because we can take the balls with values 1 and 2, and return a ball with the value |1 - 2| = 1. We can repeat this process to eventually get a ball with the value 3. However, the program will output `IMPOSSIBLE`.

The issue lies in the logic that checks if `K` can be formed by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the array. The program uses the GCD of all elements in the array to determine if `K` can be formed, but this approach does not consider the possibility of forming `K` through repeated operations that might not involve all elements.

To fix this, the program should check if `K` is a multiple of the GCD of the differences between all pairs of elements, rather than the GCD of the entire array. This ensures that the program correctly handles all possible cases.
