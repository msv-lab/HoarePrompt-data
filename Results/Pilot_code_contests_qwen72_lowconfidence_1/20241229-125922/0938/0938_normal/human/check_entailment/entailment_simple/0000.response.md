Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of `raw_input()`**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. This could lead to compatibility issues if the program is run in Python 3.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `A` using `reduce(gcd, A)`. However, the GCD of the initial elements is not sufficient to determine if the final state can contain the integer `K`. The correct approach is to check if the GCD of the differences between the elements and `K` can be reduced to 1, which would allow `K` to be formed through the operations.

3. **Flag Logic**: The logic for setting the `flag` variable is flawed. The program checks if `K` is equal to any element in `A` or if the difference between `K` and any element in `A` is divisible by the GCD of the elements. This is not a sufficient condition to ensure that `K` can be formed through the operations described.

4. **Early Termination**: The program incorrectly terminates early if `K` is greater than the maximum element in `A`. While this is a valid condition to check, it is not the only condition that needs to be considered. The GCD condition is more critical.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the GCD of the differences between the elements in `A` and `K`.
- Check if this GCD is 1. If it is, then it is possible to form `K` through the operations; otherwise, it is not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def func():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if K > max(A):
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
    else:
        # Calculate the GCD of the differences between elements in A and K
        differences = [abs(a - K) for a in A]
        gcd_diff = reduce(gcd, differences)
        
        if gcd_diff == 1:
            print('POSSIBLE')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program:
- Uses `input()` for Python 3 compatibility.
- Calculates the GCD of the differences between the elements in `A` and `K`.
- Checks if this GCD is 1 to determine if `K` can be formed.

By following this approach, the program correctly implements the problem description.
