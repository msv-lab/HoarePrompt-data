You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a box containing N balls. The i-th ball has the integer A_i written on it. Snuke can perform the following operation any number of times:

* Take out two balls from the box. Then, return them to the box along with a new ball, on which the absolute difference of the integers written on the two balls is written.



Determine whether it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9
* 1 \leq K \leq 10^9
* All input values are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
A_1 A_2 ... A_N


Output

If it is possible for Snuke to reach the state where the box contains a ball on which the integer K is written, print `POSSIBLE`; if it is not possible, print `IMPOSSIBLE`.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from fractions import gcd

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, K is an integer such that 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9, and A is a list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    N, K = map(int, raw_input().split())
    A = sorted(list(map(int, raw_input().split())))
    if (K > A[-1]) :
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
    else :
        flag = True
        tmp = reduce(gcd, A)
        if (tmp != 1) :
            flag = False
        #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is the first integer input, K is the second integer input, A is a sorted list of N integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9, K is less than or equal to A[-1], and tmp is the GCD of all elements in A. If tmp is not 1, flag is False. Otherwise, flag remains True.
        for a in A:
            if a == K or (K - a) % tmp == 0:
                flag = True
                break
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`, and `flag` is `True` if there exists an element `a` in `A` such that `a == K` or `(K - a) % tmp == 0`; otherwise, `flag` is `False`.
        if flag :
            print('POSSIBLE')
        else :
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \), `K` is less than or equal to \( A[-1] \), `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`. If `flag` is `True`, 'POSSIBLE' is printed. If `flag` is `False`, no message is printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is the first integer input, `K` is the second integer input, `A` is a sorted list of `N` integers where each element \( A_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9 \). If `K` is greater than the last element of `A` (i.e., `A[-1]`), 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed. Otherwise, `K` is less than or equal to `A[-1]`, and `tmp` is the GCD of all elements in `A`. If `flag` is `True`, 'POSSIBLE' is printed. If `flag` is `False`, no message is printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
