Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the target value `K` can be reached is flawed. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
2 5
10 15
```

### Expected Output:
```
POSSIBLE
```

### Actual Output:
```
IMPOSSIBLE
```

### Explanation:
In this case, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array `[10, 15]` is `5`. Since `K = 5` and `5` is a multiple of the GCD, it should be possible to reach `K` by performing the operations described. However, the program incorrectly prints `IMPOSSIBLE`.

The issue lies in the logic that checks if `K` can be reached. The program uses the condition `(K - a) % tmp == 0` to check if `K` can be reached, but this condition is not sufficient to cover all cases. Specifically, the program should also consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the numbers and the target `K` to ensure that the operations can indeed produce the desired result.
