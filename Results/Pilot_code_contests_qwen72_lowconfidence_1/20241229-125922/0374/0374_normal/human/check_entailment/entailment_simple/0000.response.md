Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of days `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the number of marks strictly above the water level on each day.
   - This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes several variables: `tem` (a list to store indices), `tem2` (a list of zeros to store intermediate results), and `ans` (the final answer initialized to 0).

3. **First Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and updates the `tem` list to store indices where a new mark is added. This ensures that `tem` contains indices where the water level increases.
   - This step is crucial for identifying the points where new marks are made.

4. **Second Loop**:
   - The program appends `n-1` to `tem` to ensure the last day is considered.
   - It then iterates backward through the `tem` list to set values in `tem2`. The value `cur` is updated to the maximum of the current and previous marks, ensuring that the marks are correctly propagated backward.
   - This step ensures that `tem2` contains the maximum number of marks that can be strictly above the water level for each day, considering the constraints.

5. **Final Loop**:
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and calculates the number of marks strictly below the water level for each day using `max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)`.
   - The result is accumulated in `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `ans`, which represents the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level over all days.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Handling Marks Above Water**: The program correctly identifies and propagates the number of marks above the water level using the `tem` and `tem2` lists.
- **Calculating Marks Below Water**: The program accurately calculates the number of marks below the water level by subtracting the number of marks above the water level from the maximum possible marks above the water level.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as no marks on the first day and varying water levels over the days.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes the input within the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) by using linear time complexity operations.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.
