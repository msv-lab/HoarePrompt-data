You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arkady decides to observe a river for n consecutive days. The river's water level on each day is equal to some real value.

Arkady goes to the riverside each day and makes a mark on the side of the channel at the height of the water level, but if it coincides with a mark made before, no new mark is created. The water does not wash the marks away. Arkady writes down the number of marks strictly above the water level each day, on the i-th day this value is equal to mi.

Define di as the number of marks strictly under the water level on the i-th day. You are to find out the minimum possible sum of di over all days. There are no marks on the channel before the first day.

Input

The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers m1, m2, ..., mn (0 ≤ mi < i) — the number of marks strictly above the water on each day.

Output

Output one single integer — the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.

Output

0

Note

In the first example, the following figure shows an optimal case.

<image>

Note that on day 3, a new mark should be created because if not, there cannot be 3 marks above water on day 4. The total number of marks underwater is 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 = 6.

In the second example, the following figure shows an optimal case.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    (n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()])
    (tem, tem2, ans) = ([], [0] * n, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if not tem or a[i] > a[tem[-1]]:
            tem.append(i)
    tem.append(n - 1)
    for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
        cur = max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])
        for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
            tem2[j] = cur
            cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
    for i in range(n):
        ans += max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)
    print(ans)


```
Output hints: The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and a list of `n` integers `a` where each element `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai < i. It then processes these inputs to calculate and print the total "water trapped" between the elements of `a`. The function constructs a list `tem` of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element. It uses this list to fill another list `tem2` with values that represent the maximum height of water that can be trapped at each position. Finally, it calculates the total amount of water trapped by summing the differences between the values in `tem2` and `a`, and prints this total. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (no water can be trapped), or when all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order (minimal or no water trapped).

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
