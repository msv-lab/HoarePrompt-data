You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Arkady decides to observe a river for n consecutive days. The river's water level on each day is equal to some real value.

Arkady goes to the riverside each day and makes a mark on the side of the channel at the height of the water level, but if it coincides with a mark made before, no new mark is created. The water does not wash the marks away. Arkady writes down the number of marks strictly above the water level each day, on the i-th day this value is equal to mi.

Define di as the number of marks strictly under the water level on the i-th day. You are to find out the minimum possible sum of di over all days. There are no marks on the channel before the first day.

Input

The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers m1, m2, ..., mn (0 ≤ mi < i) — the number of marks strictly above the water on each day.

Output

Output one single integer — the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.

Note

In the first example, the following figure shows an optimal case.

Note that on day 3, a new mark should be created because if not, there cannot be 3 marks above water on day 4. The total number of marks underwater is 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 = 6.

In the second example, the following figure shows an optimal case.

Program:
```
from sys import stdin

def func():
    (n, a) = (int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()])
    (tem, tem2, ans) = ([], [0] * n, 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if not tem or a[i] > a[tem[-1]]:
            tem.append(i)
    tem.append(n - 1)
    for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
        cur = max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])
        for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
            tem2[j] = cur
            cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
    for i in range(n):
        ans += max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: After carefully analyzing the provided program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The program constructs a list `tem` to keep track of the indices where new marks are added, and another list `tem2` to store the maximum number of marks that can be above the water level at each index. It then calculates the sum of the differences between the actual number of marks above the water (`a[i]`) and the maximum possible marks above the water (`tem2[i]`), which gives the number of marks strictly below the water level. This approach ensures that the minimum possible sum of `di` is calculated correctly for all given inputs. No edge cases or logical errors were identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), and m1, m2, ..., mn are a sequence of n integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, representing the number of marks strictly above the water level on each day.
def func():
    n, a = int(input()), [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]
    tem, tem2, ans = [], [0] * n, 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not tem or a[i] > a[tem[-1]]:
            tem.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.
    tem.append(n - 1)
    for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
        cur = max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])
        
        for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
            tem2[j] = cur
            cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its execution).
    for i in range(n):
        ans += max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is the sum of `max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and a list of `n` integers `a` where each element `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai < i. It then processes these inputs to calculate and print the total "water trapped" between the elements of `a`. The function constructs a list `tem` of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element. It uses this list to fill another list `tem2` with values that represent the maximum height of water that can be trapped at each position. Finally, it calculates the total amount of water trapped by summing the differences between the values in `tem2` and `a`, and prints this total. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (no water can be trapped), or when all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order (minimal or no water trapped).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
