The value of `n` is assigned from the input converted to an integer, and `a` is assigned a list of integers read from the standard input, split by spaces, and converted to integers. The length of the list `a` will be equal to `n`. The other conditions about the range of `n` and the values of `m1, m2, ..., mn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) input by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, representing the number of marks strictly above the water level on each day.**
