To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop conditions step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem` must have at least 2 elements
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `tem[i]` down to `tem[i - 1] + 1` (exclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than or equal to `tem[i - 1] + 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 1`
   - `tem[i]` is the last element in `tem`
   - `tem[i - 1]` is the second-to-last element in `tem`

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the current iteration of the outer loop (the `for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1)` loop), `i` will be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `len(tem) - 2`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` will be `len(tem) - 2`
   - `tem[i]` will now be `tem[len(tem) - 2]`
   - `tem[i - 1]` will now be `tem[len(tem) - 3]`
   - `cur` will be updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, which translates to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is now `len(tem) - 2`)
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` (which is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`)
- `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]` (which is `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`)

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`**
