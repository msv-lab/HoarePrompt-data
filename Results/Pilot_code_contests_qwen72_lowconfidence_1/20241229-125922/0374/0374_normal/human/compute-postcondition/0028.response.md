To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration
- `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of `j`**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1)`.
   - This means `j` starts at `tem[i]` and decrements to `tem[i - 1] + 1`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, `tem[i]` must be greater than `tem[i - 1]`.
   - This ensures that the range `range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1)` is non-empty and the loop will run at least once.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 3`.
   - `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, we need to verify that `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`. Given that `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element, this condition should hold true if `tem` is correctly constructed.

However, we need to ensure that the initial values of `i` and the lengths of `tem` and `a` are consistent with the loop requirements.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements (to ensure `i` is valid)
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
