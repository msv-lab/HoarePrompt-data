To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements and the initial conditions:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):` will execute if `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]` and there is at least one value between `tem[i]` and `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive).

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
   - `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
   - `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
   - `tem` includes `n-1`.
   - `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive).
   - `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `tem[i]` must be less than `tem[i - 1]`.
   - `tem` must have at least 4 elements to ensure `i` is valid.
   - `j` must be in the range `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), meaning `tem[i]` and `tem[i - 1]` should be such that `tem[i] < tem[i - 1]`.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]` and that `tem` has at least 4 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**.
