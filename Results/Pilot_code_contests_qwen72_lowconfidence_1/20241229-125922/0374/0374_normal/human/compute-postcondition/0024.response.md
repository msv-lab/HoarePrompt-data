The code snippet updates the value of `cur` to the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `cur` was previously defined as `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`.

Given this, let's calculate the new value of `cur`:

1. `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, so `i - 1` is `len(tem) - 3`.
2. `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.

Since `cur` was already set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, the new value of `cur` will be the same as the previous value of `cur` unless `a[tem[i - 1]]` is greater than `cur - 1`.

However, since `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]` and `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element, it implies that `a[tem[len(tem) - 3]]` is less than `a[tem[len(tem) - 2]]`.

Therefore, the value of `cur` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = cur`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`, `j` is `tem[i] - 1`**
