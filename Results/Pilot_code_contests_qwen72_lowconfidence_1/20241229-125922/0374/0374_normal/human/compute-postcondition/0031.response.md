To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and the current state:

### Current State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `tem[i]` down to `tem[i - 1] + 1` (exclusive).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than `tem[i - 1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `j` starts at `tem[i]` and decreases by 1 each iteration.
- After the first iteration, `j` will be `tem[i] - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `tem[i] - 1` must be greater than `tem[i - 1]`.

### Updated State:
- `n` remains the same
- `a` remains the same
- `tem` remains the same
- `tem2` remains the same
- `cur` remains the same
- `ans` remains the same
- `i` remains the same
- `j` is now `tem[i] - 1`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `j` is `tem[i] - 1`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
