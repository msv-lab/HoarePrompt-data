The code snippet assigns the maximum value between `a[tem[i]]` and `a[tem[i - 1]]` to the variable `cur`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.

Given this, the code snippet:
```python
cur = max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Values of `tem[i]` and `tem[i - 1]`:**
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
   - `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
   - `tem` includes `n-1`, meaning the last element of `tem` is `n-1`.

2. **Calculate `cur`:**
   - `cur` is assigned the maximum value between `a[tem[i]]` and `a[tem[i - 1]]`.
   - Since `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `tem[i]` is the 4th last element in `tem`, and `tem[i - 1]` is the 5th last element in `tem`.

3. **Update the State:**
   - The value of `cur` is now `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 4]], a[tem[len(tem) - 5]])`.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 4]], a[tem[len(tem) - 5]])`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.**
