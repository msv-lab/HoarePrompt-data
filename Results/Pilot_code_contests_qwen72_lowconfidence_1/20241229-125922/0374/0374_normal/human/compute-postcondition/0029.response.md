The code snippet `tem2[j] = cur` assigns the value of `cur` to the element at index `j` in the list `tem2`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

The value of `cur` is determined as follows:
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`

After executing the code snippet:
- `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur`

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, specifically `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
