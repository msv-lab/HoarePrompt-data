To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])` and `tem2[j]` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
- `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` in reverse order (`-1` step). For the loop to execute, `tem[i]` must be greater than or equal to `tem[i - 1] + 1`.
2. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will start at `tem[i] - 1` in the next iteration.
   - `i` remains the same until the outer loop (which is not shown) changes it.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is `tem[i] - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `tem`, `tem2`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])` and `tem2[j]` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`, `j` is `tem[i] - 1`**
