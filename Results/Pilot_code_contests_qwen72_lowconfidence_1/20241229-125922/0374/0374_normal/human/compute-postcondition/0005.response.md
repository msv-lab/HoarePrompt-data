Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]`, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0. If `tem` is empty or `a[i]` is greater than `a[tem[-1]]`, `tem` is a list containing `[0]`.***
