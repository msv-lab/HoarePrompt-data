To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `n-1`
- `tem` includes `n-1`

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates from `len(tem) - 1` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(tem) > 1`. This means `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` in the loop is `len(tem) - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`tem` must have at least 2 elements**: This ensures that the loop can execute at least once.
- **`i` should be set to `len(tem) - 1`**: This is the starting point of the loop.

### Final State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`
- `tem` includes `n-1`

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 1`, `tem` includes `n-1`**
