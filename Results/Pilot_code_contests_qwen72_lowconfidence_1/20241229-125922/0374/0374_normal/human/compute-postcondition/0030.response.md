The code snippet updates the value of `cur` to the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `cur` was initially set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, which means `i` points to the third last element in `tem`.
- `tem[i - 1]` refers to the fourth last element in `tem`.
- `a[tem[i - 1]]` is the value of `a` at the index corresponding to the fourth last element in `tem`.

The new value of `cur` is calculated as follows:
- `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Let's break it down:
- `a[tem[i - 1]]` is the value of `a` at the index corresponding to the fourth last element in `tem`.
- `cur - 1` is the current value of `cur` decreased by 1.

Therefore, the new value of `cur` is the maximum of these two values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**.
