The code `tem.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list `tem`. Given that `i` is 2, the new state of `tem` will be `[0, 1, 2]`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is `[0, 1, 2]`, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tem` is empty or `a[i]` > `a[tem[-1]]`**
