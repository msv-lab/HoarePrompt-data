The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the maximum value between `tem2[i] - a[i]` and `0`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `ans` is updated to `ans + max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)`.
- `i` is initially 1.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards.
- `ans` is initially `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`.

Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + max(tem2[1] - a[1], 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0) + max(tem2[1] - a[1], 0)`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
