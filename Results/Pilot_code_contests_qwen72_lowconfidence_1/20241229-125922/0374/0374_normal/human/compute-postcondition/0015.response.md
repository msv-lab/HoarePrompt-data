The code snippet assigns the maximum value between `a[tem[i]]` and `a[tem[i - 1]]` to the variable `cur`. Let's break down the impact:

- `i` is set to `len(tem) - 1`, which means `i` points to the last index of the `tem` list.
- `tem` is a list of indices, and `tem[i]` refers to the last element in `tem`.
- `tem[i - 1]` refers to the second-to-last element in `tem`.
- `cur` is assigned the maximum value between `a[tem[i]]` and `a[tem[i - 1]]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.

Let's determine the values:
- `i` is the last index of `tem`, so `i = len(tem) - 1`.
- `tem[i]` is the last element of `tem`, which is `n-1`.
- `tem[i - 1]` is the second-to-last element of `tem`.

Since `tem` includes `n-1`, let's denote the second-to-last element of `tem` as `j` (where `j` is some index less than `n-1`).

Thus, `cur` is assigned the maximum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[j]`.

The output state will include:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[j])` where `j` is the second-to-last element of `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 1`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[j])` where `j` is the second-to-last element of `tem`.**
