The code snippet `ans += max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)` updates the value of `ans` based on the difference between the elements `tem2[i]` and `a[i]`. Specifically, it adds the maximum of `tem2[i] - a[i]` and 0 to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0

The code updates `ans` as follows:
- `ans` is incremented by the value of `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`

Let's break this down:
1. `tem2[0]` is the first element in the list `tem2`.
2. `a[0]` is the first element in the list `a`.
3. `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)` computes the maximum of `tem2[0] - a[0]` and 0.
4. `ans` is updated by adding this maximum value to its current value (which is 0).

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`.

The updated state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards
- `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`, `i` is 0**
