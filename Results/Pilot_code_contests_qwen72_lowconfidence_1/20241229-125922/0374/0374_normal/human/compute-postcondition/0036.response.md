The code updates the value of `cur` based on the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `tem`, `tem2`, `ans`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Since `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is a valid index for `tem`. Also, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`, which means `a[tem[i - 1]]` is a valid element in `a`.

Let's assume the current value of `cur` is `C` and `a[tem[i - 1]]` is `A`. After executing the code, `cur` will be `max(A, C - 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `cur`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `j` is `tem[i] - 2`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `cur`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `j` is `tem[i] - 2`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1], `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`**
