To determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    tem2[j] = cur
    cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive) in reverse order.
2. **Variable Updates**:
   - `tem2[j]` is set to `cur`.
   - `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- **`tem2`**: The values in `tem2` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive) will be filled with the decreasing values of `cur`.
- **`cur`**: After the loop, `cur` will be the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and the last value of `cur - 1` before the loop ends.
- **`i`**: Remains unchanged (`len(tem) - 3`).
- **`ans`**: Remains 0.
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- **`a`**: Remains a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- **`tem`**: Remains a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements. It still includes `n-1`.

### Summary:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the state of the variables will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`.**
