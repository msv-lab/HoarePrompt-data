The code snippet `tem2[j] = cur` updates the value of `tem2[j]` to `cur`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Impact on `tem2[j]`:**
   - Before: `tem2[j]` was `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
   - After: `tem2[j]` is now `cur`.

2. **Impact on other variables:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
   - `tem` remains a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `tem2` remains a list of `n` zeros, but the value at index `j` is now `cur`.
   - `ans` remains 0.
   - `i` remains `len(tem) - 2`.
   - `tem` includes `n-1`.
   - `cur` remains `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
   - `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`.
   - `j` remains `tem[i] - 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = cur`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`, `j` is `tem[i] - 1`**.
