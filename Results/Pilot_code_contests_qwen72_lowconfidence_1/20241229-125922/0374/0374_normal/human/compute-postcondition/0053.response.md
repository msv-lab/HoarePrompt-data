To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards.
- `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration (which is the initialization), `i` is 0.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue executing. Since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0)`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
