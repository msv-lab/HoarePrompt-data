The given code snippet updates the value of `tem2[j]` to `cur`. To understand the impact, let's break down the relevant parts:

1. `tem2[j] = cur`: This line sets the value of `tem2[j]` to the current value of `cur`.

From the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive).
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

Given the code snippet:
- The value of `tem2[j]` is updated to `cur`.
- The value of `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.

Since `j` is not specified, we assume `j` is a valid index within the range of `tem2` that is being updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**.
