To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])` and `tem2[j]` is now updated to `cur`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `j` is `tem[i] - 1`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `tem[i - 1]`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
   - `j` is `tem[i] - 1`
3. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `j = tem[i] - 1` and decrements `j` by 1 until `j` is no longer greater than `tem[i - 1]`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- **`j`**: After the first iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1.
- **`tem[i]`**: Remains the same.
- **`tem[i - 1]`**: Remains the same.
- **Other Variables**: `n`, `a`, `tem`, `tem2`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])` and `tem2[j]` is now updated to `cur`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `j` is `tem[i] - 2`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])` and `tem2[j]` is now updated to `cur`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `j` is `tem[i] - 2`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
