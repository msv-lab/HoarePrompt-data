To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `tem[i]` and less than `tem[i - 1]`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `j` starts at `tem[i]`
   - The loop will decrement `j` by 1 until it reaches `tem[i - 1]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`j`**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `tem[i] + 1` because the loop decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains the same for the current loop iteration, but it will be decremented in the next outer loop iteration.

### Updated State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`
- `j` is `tem[i] + 1`
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `j` is `tem[i] + 1`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**
