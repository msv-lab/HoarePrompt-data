The code snippet `tem2[j] = cur` updates the value of `tem2[j]` to the current value of `cur`. Let's analyze the impact of this code:

- `tem2[j]` is updated to `cur`.
- The value of `cur` is defined as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- The value of `j` is `tem[i]`.
- The value of `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `j` is `tem[i]`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet `tem2[j] = cur`:
- `tem2[j]` is updated to the value of `cur`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is `cur` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `j` is `tem[i]`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**.
