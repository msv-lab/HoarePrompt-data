The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. The initial state specifies that `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, and `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`. Therefore, `a[tem[i - 1]]` is a valid element in the list `a`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is `cur` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`
- `j` is `tem[i]`
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]

After executing the code:
- `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is `cur` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `j` is `tem[i]`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]**
