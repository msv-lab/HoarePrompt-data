To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- **State before the loop starts:**
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) input by the user.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
  - `tem` is an empty list.
  - `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros.
  - `ans` is 0.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n-1`. This is automatically handled by the `range(n)` function.

3. **List `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `mi` satisfies 0 ≤ mi < i. This condition is given and does not need adjustment.

4. **List `tem`:**
   - `tem` is an empty list. This state does not affect the loop execution directly but might be used within the loop body.

5. **List `tem2`:**
   - `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros. This state is given and does not need adjustment.

6. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is 0. This state does not affect the loop execution directly but might be modified within the loop body.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the only condition that needs to be ensured for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is an empty list, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
