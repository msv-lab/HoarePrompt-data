To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop's behavior over its entire run. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[j])` where `j` is the second-to-last element of `tem`.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` in reverse order, updating `tem2` and `cur` as follows:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    tem2[j] = cur
    cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
```

### Final Output State:
- **`n`**: Remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- **`a`**: Remains the same list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- **`tem`**: Remains a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements. `tem` includes `n-1`.
- **`tem2`**: After the loop, `tem2` will be populated such that for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`, `tem2[j]` will be set to the value of `cur` during the iteration. The final value of `cur` will be `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, where `cur` starts as `max(a[n-1], a[j])` and decreases or stays the same with each iteration.
- **`ans`**: Remains 0.
- **`i`**: Decrements by 1 with each full iteration of the outer loop (if there is an outer loop). If the loop runs to completion, `i` will be `len(tem) - 2` after the first full iteration of the outer loop.
- **`cur`**: After the loop, `cur` will be the maximum value between the element at `a[tem[i - 1]]` and the decremented value of `cur` from the previous iteration.

### Summary:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the final state will be:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements. `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2` if the loop runs to completion.
- `cur` is the final value after the last update, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2` if the loop runs to completion, `cur` is the final value after the last update, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.**
