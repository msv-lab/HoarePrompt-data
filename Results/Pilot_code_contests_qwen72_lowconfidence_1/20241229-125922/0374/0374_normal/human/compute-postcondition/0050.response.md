Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its execution).**
