The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of `a[tem[i]]` and `a[tem[i - 1]]`. Given that `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `cur` is now the maximum of the elements in `a` at the indices `tem[len(tem) - 3]` and `tem[len(tem) - 4]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])`.
