The code `tem2[j] = cur` updates the value of `tem2[j]` to the current value of `cur`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`
- `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`

The code snippet `tem2[j] = cur` updates the value at index `j` in `tem2` to the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is defined as `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, the value of `cur` is the maximum of the element in `a` at the index `tem[len(tem) - 3]` and the current value of `cur` decremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, and `tem2[j]` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`
- `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])` and `tem2[j]` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`**
