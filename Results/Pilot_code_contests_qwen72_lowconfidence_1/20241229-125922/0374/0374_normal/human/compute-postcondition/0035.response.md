The value of `tem2[j]` is updated to `cur`. Given the initial conditions, `j` is calculated as `tem[i] - 2`, and `cur` is defined as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Since `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`, the specific value of `j` is determined by the value of `tem[i]`. The value of `cur` is also determined based on the current state of `cur` and the value of `a[tem[i - 1]]`.

Thus, the only change is the assignment to `tem2[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `cur`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `j` is `tem[i] - 2`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
