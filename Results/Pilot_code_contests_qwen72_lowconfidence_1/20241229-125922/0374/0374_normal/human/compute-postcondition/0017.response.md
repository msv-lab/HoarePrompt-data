The code snippet assigns the value of `cur` to `tem2[j]`. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means the exact position in `tem2` where `cur` is assigned cannot be determined. Since the assignment depends on the undefined variable `j`, we cannot precisely determine the updated state of `tem2`. However, we can state that `tem2[j]` will be assigned the value of `cur`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 1`
- `tem` includes `n-1`
- `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`
- `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`

After the execution of the code snippet:
- `tem2[j]` is assigned the value of `cur`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 1`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`**
