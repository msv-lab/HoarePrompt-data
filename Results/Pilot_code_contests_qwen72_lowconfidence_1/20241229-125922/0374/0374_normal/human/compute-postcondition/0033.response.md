The value of `cur` is updated to the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])` and `tem2[j]` is now updated to `cur`
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`
- `j` is `tem[i] - 1`
- `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`

The specific value of `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], a[tem[len(tem) - 4]])` and `tem2[j]` is now updated to `cur`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `j` is `tem[i] - 1`, `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`**
