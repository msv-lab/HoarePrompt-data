To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start and proceed through its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its execution)

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, as it is the initial value for the loop counter.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure `n` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute at least once.
- Set `i` to 0 to start the loop correctly.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
