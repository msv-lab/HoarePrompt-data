To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `j` is `tem[i] + 1`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive) in reverse order. This means `j` starts at `tem[i]` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `tem[i - 1] + 1`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
   - `j` is `tem[i] + 1`.
   - `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - **`j`**: Since `j` is currently `tem[i] + 1`, in the next iteration, `j` will be `tem[i] + 1 - 1 = tem[i]`.
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` remains the same for the duration of the loop, as the loop only modifies `j`.

### Adjusted State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `j` is `tem[i]`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `j` is `tem[i]`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**
