To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's break down the process step by step, focusing on the loop code and the initial conditions provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers initialized to some values.
- `cur` is initially set to `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1):
    tem2[j] = cur
    cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` in reverse order.
   - For each iteration, `tem2[j]` is set to the current value of `cur`.
   - `cur` is then updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

2. **State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute `tem[i - 1] - tem[i] - 1` times.
   - After the loop finishes, `cur` will be the result of applying the `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` operation repeatedly.
   - The final value of `cur` will be the last value computed by the loop, which depends on the values of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and the initial `cur`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - `tem2[j]` for `j` in the range `[tem[i] + 1, tem[i - 1]]` will be set to the values of `cur` during the loop.
   - `cur` will be the final value after all iterations, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - (tem[i - 1] - tem[i] - 1))`.

4. **Variables**:
   - `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
   - `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
   - `tem` remains a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 4 elements, including `n-1`.
   - `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` for `j` in the range `[tem[i] + 1, tem[i - 1]]` is set to the values of `cur` during the loop.
   - `cur` is the final value after the loop, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - (tem[i - 1] - tem[i] - 1))`.
   - `ans` remains 0.
   - `i` remains `len(tem) - 4`.
   - `j` is no longer relevant after the loop.

### Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` for `j` in the range `[tem[i] + 1, tem[i - 1]]` is set to the values of `cur` during the loop, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - (tem[i - 1] - tem[i] - 1))`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.**
