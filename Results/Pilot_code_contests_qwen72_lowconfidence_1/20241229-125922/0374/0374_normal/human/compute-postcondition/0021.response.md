The code updates the value of `cur` to be the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. Let's break down the impact:

- `cur` was previously set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2`.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`.

Given this, the new value of `cur` is calculated as follows:
- `cur = max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`
- Since `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `i - 1` is `len(tem) - 3`.
- Therefore, `cur = max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.

Since `cur` was already set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, the new value of `cur` remains the same as its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])` and `tem2[j]` is updated to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 2`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`, `tem[len(tem) - 2] > tem[len(tem) - 3]`**
