To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop conditions:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- If `tem` is empty or `a[i]` is greater than `a[tem[-1]]`, `tem` is a list containing `[0]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
3. **List `a`**: The list `a` contains `n` integers, and the condition `0 ≤ mi < i` ensures that each element in `a` is less than its index.
4. **List `tem`**: Initially, `tem` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]`. If `tem` is empty or `a[i]` is greater than `a[tem[-1]]`, `tem` is set to `[0]`.
5. **List `tem2`**: This is a list of `n` zeros, which remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
6. **Variable `ans`**: This is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `tem` will be checked based on the new value of `i`. Since `i` is now 1, we need to evaluate the condition `if tem is empty or a[i] > a[tem[-1]]`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `tem` is initially `[0]`, we need to check if `a[1] > a[0]`.
  - If `a[1] > a[0]`, then `tem` remains `[0]`.
  - If `a[1] <= a[0]`, then `tem` might be updated, but the problem does not specify how it changes in this case, so we assume it remains `[0]` for simplicity.
- `tem2` and `ans` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list containing `[0]`, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1.**
