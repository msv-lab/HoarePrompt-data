The value of `i` is appended to the list `tem`. Initially, `tem` contains `[0]`, and `i` is 1. After appending, `tem` will contain `[0, 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list containing `[0, 1]`, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1.**
