The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `max(tem2[i] - a[i], 0)` to its current value. The variable `i` is set to 2, and since `n` is greater than 2, the operation is valid.

Given that `i` is 2, `tem2[2]` and `a[2]` are accessed. The new value of `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus the result of `max(tem2[2] - a[2], 0)`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `tem`, `tem2`) remain unchanged, and the conditions that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, `a` is a list of integers with specific constraints, `tem` is a list of indices with specific properties, and `tem2` is constructed as described, all remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where each element `tem2[j]` is set to the maximum value between the corresponding element in `a` at the index from `tem` and the decrementing value of `cur`, starting from the last element in `tem` and moving backwards, `ans` is `max(tem2[0] - a[0], 0) + max(tem2[1] - a[1], 0) + max(tem2[2] - a[2], 0)`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
