The code snippet updates the value of `tem2[j]` to `cur`. Let's go through the impact of this line:

- `tem2[j]` is updated to the value of `cur`.
- `j` is calculated as `tem[i] + 1`.
- `cur` is defined as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `j` is `tem[i] + 1`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

The value of `tem2[j]` is set to `cur`. Since `j` is `tem[i] + 1`, the specific value of `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is updated to `cur`.

Therefore, the output state is:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])` and `tem2[tem[i] + 1]` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `j` is `tem[i] + 1`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**.
