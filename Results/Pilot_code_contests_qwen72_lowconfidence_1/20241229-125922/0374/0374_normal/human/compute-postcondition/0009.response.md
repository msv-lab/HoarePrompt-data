To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given state and the loop condition:

- **Current State**: 
  - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i
  - `tem` is a list containing `[0, 1]`
  - `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros
  - `ans` is 0
  - `i` is 1
  - `tem` is empty or `a[i]` > `a[tem[-1]]`

- **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The conditions involving `tem` and `a[i]` need to be re-evaluated:
- If `tem` is empty or `a[i]` > `a[tem[-1]]` was true at the end of the previous iteration, we need to check if this condition still holds with the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is now 2, we need to check the condition with `a[2]` and `a[tem[-1]]` (where `tem[-1]` is 1). If `a[2]` > `a[1]`, the condition remains true; otherwise, it may change.

However, without specific values for `a[1]` and `a[2]`, we cannot definitively say whether the condition will hold. Therefore, we will assume the condition remains the same unless specified otherwise.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list containing `[0, 1]`, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `tem` is empty or `a[i]` > `a[tem[-1]]`**
