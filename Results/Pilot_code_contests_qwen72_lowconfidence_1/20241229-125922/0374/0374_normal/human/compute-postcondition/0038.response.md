To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 3 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive).
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 3`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than 0. The loop starts with `i = len(tem) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 3`.
   - `tem` has at least 3 elements.
   - `tem2` is initialized based on the values of `cur` and the indices in `tem`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is currently `len(tem) - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `len(tem) - 4`.

4. **Adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
   - The condition `i > 0` must still hold true, so `len(tem) - 4 > 0` must be true, which means `len(tem) > 4`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `len(tem)` must be greater than 4 to ensure the loop continues.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the decreasing values of `cur` from `tem[i]` to `tem[i - 1]` (exclusive), `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.**
