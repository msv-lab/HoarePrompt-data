The code snippet updates the value of `cur` to be the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`.

- `cur` was initially set to `max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`.
- `i` is currently `len(tem) - 1`.
- `tem[i]` is the last element in `tem`, which is `n-1`.
- `tem[i - 1]` is the second-to-last element in `tem`.

The new value of `cur` is calculated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros with `tem2[j] = max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 1`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`**
