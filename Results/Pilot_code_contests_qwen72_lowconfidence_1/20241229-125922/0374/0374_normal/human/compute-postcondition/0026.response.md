To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 2` if the loop runs to completion.
- `cur` is the final value after the last update, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(tem) - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(tem) - 1` to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order. This means `i` starts at `len(tem) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `len(tem) - 2` (if the loop runs to completion).
   - `cur` is the final value after the last update, which is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `len(tem) - 3`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted from `len(tem) - 2` to `len(tem) - 3`.
   - `cur` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, `cur` will be set to `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`.

### Final Adjusted State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, and `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is set to the value of `cur` during the iteration, and `cur` is updated as `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)` for each `j` in the range `[tem[i], tem[i - 1]]`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 3`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[len(tem) - 3]], cur - 1)`**.
