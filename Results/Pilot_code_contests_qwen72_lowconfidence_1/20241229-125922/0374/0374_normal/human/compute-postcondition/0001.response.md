The provided code initializes three variables: `tem`, `tem2`, and `ans`. Here's the impact of this initialization:

- `tem` is initialized as an empty list.
- `tem2` is initialized as a list containing `n` zeros, where `n` is a positive integer input by the user.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.

The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) input by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is an empty list, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.**
