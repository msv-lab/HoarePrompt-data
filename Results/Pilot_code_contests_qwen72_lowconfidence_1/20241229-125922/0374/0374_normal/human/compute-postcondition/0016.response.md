To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the conditions required for the loop to run:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for j in range(tem[i], tem[i - 1], -1)` will execute if `tem[i]` is greater than `tem[i - 1]`. This means that the range must have at least one value to iterate over, which implies `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`.

2. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is set to `len(tem) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the `tem` list.

3. **Properties of `tem`**: `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index. Additionally, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, and it includes `n-1`.

4. **Initial State of `cur`**: `cur` is set to `max(a[n-1], a[j])` where `j` is the second-to-last element of `tem`. Since `i` is the index of the last element in `tem`, `j` would be `tem[len(tem) - 2]`.

Given these conditions, let's adjust the state:

- **`i` is `len(tem) - 1`**: This is already correct as per the initial state.
- **`tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`**: For the loop to execute, this condition must hold true. Given that `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, this condition should naturally be satisfied.
- **`tem` must have at least 2 elements**: This is necessary for the loop to execute because `i` is `len(tem) - 1` and we need `tem[i - 1]` to be defined.
- **`cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`**: This is already correct as per the initial state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `tem` has at least 2 elements and that `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]` for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 2 elements, `tem2` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 1`, `tem` includes `n-1`, `cur` is `max(a[n-1], a[tem[len(tem) - 2]])`, `tem[i] > tem[i - 1]`**
