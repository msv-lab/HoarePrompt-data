Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and a list of `n` integers `a` where each element `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai < i. It then processes these inputs to calculate and print the total "water trapped" between the elements of `a`. The function constructs a list `tem` of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element. It uses this list to fill another list `tem2` with values that represent the maximum height of water that can be trapped at each position. Finally, it calculates the total amount of water trapped by summing the differences between the values in `tem2` and `a`, and prints this total. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Potential edge cases include when `n` is 1 (no water can be trapped), or when all elements in `a` are in non-decreasing order (minimal or no water trapped). **
