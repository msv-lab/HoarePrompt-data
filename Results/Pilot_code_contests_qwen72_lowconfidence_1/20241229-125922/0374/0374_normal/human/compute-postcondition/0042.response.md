The code snippet updates the value of `cur` by setting it to the maximum of `a[tem[i - 1]]` and `cur - 1`. Let's break down the changes and their impact:

- `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `tem`, `tem2`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i.
- `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index.
- `tem` must have at least 4 elements.
- `tem` includes `n-1`.
- `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `cur` is `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is `len(tem) - 4`.
- `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`.

After executing the code:
- `cur` is updated to `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 105), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ mi < i, `tem` is a list of indices where each element in `a` at these indices is strictly greater than the previous element in `a` up to that index, `tem` must have at least 4 elements, `tem` includes `n-1`, `tem2` is a list of `n` integers where `tem2[j]` is now `max(a[tem[i]], a[tem[i - 1]])`, `cur` is `max(a[tem[i - 1]], cur - 1)`, `ans` is 0, `i` is `len(tem) - 4`, `tem[i]` is less than `tem[i - 1]`**.
