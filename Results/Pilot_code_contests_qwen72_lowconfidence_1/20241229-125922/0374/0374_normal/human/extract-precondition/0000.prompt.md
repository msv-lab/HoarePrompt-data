You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Arkady decides to observe a river for n consecutive days. The river's water level on each day is equal to some real value.

Arkady goes to the riverside each day and makes a mark on the side of the channel at the height of the water level, but if it coincides with a mark made before, no new mark is created. The water does not wash the marks away. Arkady writes down the number of marks strictly above the water level each day, on the i-th day this value is equal to mi.

Define di as the number of marks strictly under the water level on the i-th day. You are to find out the minimum possible sum of di over all days. There are no marks on the channel before the first day.

Input

The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers m1, m2, ..., mn (0 ≤ mi < i) — the number of marks strictly above the water on each day.

Output

Output one single integer — the minimum possible sum of the number of marks strictly below the water level among all days.

0 1 1 2 2


Output

0

Note

In the first example, the following figure shows an optimal case.

<image>

Note that on day 3, a new mark should be created because if not, there cannot be 3 marks above water on day 4. The total number of marks underwater is 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 1 = 6.

In the second example, the following figure shows an optimal case.
