The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input a value. It then converts the input to an integer and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, terminating the function execution. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value (if the input was valid), and no other variables or state changes are affected.
