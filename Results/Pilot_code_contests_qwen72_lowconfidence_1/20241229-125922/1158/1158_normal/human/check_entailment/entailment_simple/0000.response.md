Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Counting of 'a' and 'b':**
   - The program counts the total number of 'a' and 'b' in both strings `s` and `t` combined, which is incorrect. It should count the number of 'a' and 'b' in each string separately to determine if they can be made equal.

2. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - The program checks if the total count of 'a' and 'b' is odd, which is incorrect. It should check if the counts of 'a' and 'b' in each string are such that they can be balanced by swaps. Specifically, the difference between the counts of 'a' and 'b' in both strings should be even.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The swapping logic is flawed. The program attempts to swap 'a' and 'b' characters, but it does not correctly handle the cases where the counts of 'a' and 'b' are not balanced. It also does not ensure that the swaps are minimal and correct.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program does not correctly format the output as specified in the problem description. It should print the minimum number of operations required and the sequence of swaps, or `-1` if it is impossible to make the strings equal.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Count the Characters:**
   - Count the number of 'a' and 'b' in both strings `s` and `t` separately.
   - Check if the difference between the counts of 'a' and 'b' in both strings is even. If not, it is impossible to make the strings equal.

2. **Generate Swaps:**
   - If the counts are balanced, generate the minimal number of swaps required to make the strings equal.
   - Swap mismatched characters in pairs to minimize the number of operations.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the number of swaps and the sequence of swaps, or `-1` if it is impossible.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:

```python
def solve(n, s, t):
    s_count_a = s.count('a')
    s_count_b = n - s_count_a
    t_count_a = t.count('a')
    t_count_b = n - t_count_a

    if (s_count_a + t_count_a) % 2 != 0 or (s_count_b + t_count_b) % 2 != 0:
        return -1

    swaps = []
    mismatch_a = []
    mismatch_b = []

    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] != t[i]:
            if s[i] == 'a':
                mismatch_a.append(i)
            else:
                mismatch_b.append(i)

    for i in range(0, len(mismatch_a), 2):
        if i + 1 < len(mismatch_a):
            swaps.append((mismatch_a[i] + 1, mismatch_a[i + 1] + 1))
        else:
            swaps.append((mismatch_a[i] + 1, mismatch_b[0] + 1))

    for i in range(0, len(mismatch_b), 2):
        if i + 1 < len(mismatch_b):
            swaps.append((mismatch_b[i] + 1, mismatch_b[i + 1] + 1))
        else:
            swaps.append((mismatch_b[i] + 1, mismatch_a[0] + 1))

    print(len(swaps))
    for swap in swaps:
        print(swap[0], swap[1])

n = int(input())
s = input()
t = input()
result = solve(n, s, t)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
```

This implementation correctly follows the problem description and ensures that the strings can be made equal with the minimum number of swaps, or it prints `-1` if it is impossible.
