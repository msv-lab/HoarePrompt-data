Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided code for `func_16` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the code is correct for every potential case:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the length `n` of the strings `s` and `t`, and then reads the strings themselves. This matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Counting Characters**: The function counts the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings combined. If the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, it is impossible to make the strings equal, and the function correctly outputs `-1` and exits.

3. **Identifying Mismatched Indices**: The function identifies indices where `s[i]` and `t[i]` differ and categorizes them into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on whether the mismatch is due to 'a' or 'b'.

4. **Generating Swaps**:
   - If the number of mismatches in `a` is odd, the function adds a self-swap to make the number of mismatches even. This ensures that the remaining mismatches can be paired up.
   - The function then pairs up the mismatches in `a` and `b` to generate the minimum number of swaps required to make the strings equal.

5. **Outputting the Result**: The function outputs the number of swaps and the sequence of swaps, which is consistent with the output format specified in the problem description.

The code handles all edge cases, including:
- When the strings are already equal (no swaps needed).
- When it is impossible to make the strings equal (odd total count of 'a' or 'b').
- When the strings have different lengths (handled by the input format).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the code works correctly in all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
