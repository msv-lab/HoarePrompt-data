Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings combined is odd. According to the problem description, if the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters is odd, it is impossible to make the strings equal, and the program should output -1. However, the current implementation does not correctly check this condition.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```python
a = 0
b = 0
for i in range(n):
    if s[i] == 'a':
        a += 1
    else:
        b += 1
    
    if t[i] == 'a':
        a += 1
    else:
        b += 1
    
if (a % 2 == 1 or b % 2 == 1) :
    func_17(-1)
    exit()
```

The issue is that the variables `a` and `b` are counting the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings `s` and `t` combined, rather than checking the parity of the counts in each string separately. This means that if the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, the program incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to make the strings equal, even if it is possible.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
abab
baba
```

Here, the total number of 'a' characters is 4 (even) and the total number of 'b' characters is 4 (even). However, the program will incorrectly output -1 because it checks the total count of 'a' and 'b' in both strings combined, which is 8 (even).

To fix this, the program should check the parity of the counts of 'a' and 'b' in each string separately. If both strings have an even number of 'a' and 'b' characters, it is possible to make the strings equal. If either string has an odd number of 'a' or 'b' characters, it is impossible to make the strings equal.

Here is the corrected condition:
```python
a_s = s.count('a')
b_s = s.count('b')
a_t = t.count('a')
b_t = t.count('b')

if (a_s % 2 == 1 or b_s % 2 == 1 or a_t % 2 == 1 or b_t % 2 == 1):
    func_17(-1)
    exit()
```

With this correction, the program will correctly handle the case where the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in each string is odd, ensuring that the program follows the problem description for every potential case.
