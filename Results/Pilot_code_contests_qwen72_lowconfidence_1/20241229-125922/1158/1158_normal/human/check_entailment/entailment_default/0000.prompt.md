You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "a" and "b". 

Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.

You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the length of s and t.

The second line contains one string s consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

The third line contains one string t consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

Output

If it is impossible to make these strings equal, print -1.

Otherwise, in the first line print k — the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. In each of the next k lines print two integers — the index in the string s and the index in the string t that should be used in the corresponding swap operation. 

Examples

Input


4
abab
aabb


Output


2
3 3
3 2


Input


1
a
b


Output


-1


Input


8
babbaabb
abababaa


Output


3
2 6
1 3
7 8

Note

In the first example two operations are enough. For example, you can swap the third letter in s with the third letter in t. Then s =  "abbb", t =  "aaab". Then swap the third letter in s and the second letter in t. Then both s and t are equal to "abab".

In the second example it's impossible to make two strings equal.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input a value. It then converts the input to an integer and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, terminating the function execution. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value (if the input was valid), and no other variables or state changes are affected.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the returned value is the exact input provided by the user. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or special characters, which are treated as part of the input string.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting a string where elements are separated by spaces. It splits this string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input string is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input is not terminated by a newline, the function will wait for additional input until a newline is encountered.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_3` and returns a list generated from the output of `func_3`. The content of the returned list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3`, which is not provided. If `func_3` returns an iterable, `func_4` will convert it into a list and return it. If `func_3` returns a non-iterable, `func_4` will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert it to a list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. After the function `func_5` completes, the recursion limit and stack size are configured as specified, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The main thread that called `func_5` continues its execution independently of the new thread. If the `main` function or the thread creation fails, the behavior is undefined and could result in an error or exception.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the first element of `item`. The function assumes that the first element is comparable and can be used for sorting. However, the function does not handle cases where `item` is not a tuple or list, or where `item` is empty, which could lead to a TypeError or IndexError, respectively.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` where each element is either a dictionary or an object with a `getKey` method defined. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted based on the keys returned by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If any element in `l` does not have a `getKey` method, the function will raise an `AttributeError`. The sorting is stable, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order in the output list will be the same as in the input list.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is the value of `num`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers. If either `n` or `m` is 0, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not validate the type of `num`, so it can be any data type.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `0` if `x` is `0`, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly identifies whether `x` is a power of 2 by leveraging bitwise operations. If `x` is `0`, it explicitly returns `0`. For non-zero values, the function checks if `x` is a power of 2 by ensuring that `x & (x - 1)` is `0`. This works because a power of 2 in binary representation has exactly one bit set to `1`, and subtracting `1` from it flips all the bits up to and including the first `1`. Therefore, the bitwise AND of `x` and `x - 1` will be `0` if `x` is a power of 2. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers, which will always return `False` since negative numbers cannot be powers of 2.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles the conversion for all valid inputs within the specified range. No edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code. After the function executes, the program state includes the returned string representing the binary form of `n`.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. If `n` is 0, the function returns a list containing a single element `[0]`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes that `n` is always a non-negative integer. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the returned list of digits, and the original input `n` remains unchanged.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the initial values of these variables. After the function executes, `y` is 0, and the returned value is `x^y % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1. The annotation stating that the function always returns 1 is incorrect.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the returned value is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is a prime number. The function returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any prime number of the form 6k ± 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is greater than or equal to the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6. The function returns `True` if none of these conditions are met, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Edge cases include `n` being 2 or 3, which are correctly identified as prime numbers, and `n` being 1, which is correctly identified as not a prime number.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` redirects the standard input to read from the file 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to the file 'output.txt'. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the files do not exist or cannot be opened, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the function does not restore the original standard input and output streams after redirection, so these changes persist until explicitly reverted.
Function number 16 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` processes two lists of characters `s` and `t`, both of which contain only 'a' and 'b' and have the same length `n`. The function aims to transform `s` into `t` by swapping elements in `s` and `t` at specific indices, while ensuring that the number of swaps required is minimized. The function performs the following actions:

1.

    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
''' 

 Output hints for function17:  The function `func_17` prints the given positional arguments to a specified file stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It separates the arguments using a delimiter specified by the `sep` parameter (defaulting to a single space) and appends a string specified by the `end` parameter (defaulting to a newline character) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the write buffer of the file stream is flushed immediately after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representations of the positional arguments, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys if they were present. The `at_start` flag is `False` if there was at least one positional argument, otherwise, it remains `True`. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where no content is written to the file stream, and the `flush` parameter being `False`, where the buffer is not flushed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
