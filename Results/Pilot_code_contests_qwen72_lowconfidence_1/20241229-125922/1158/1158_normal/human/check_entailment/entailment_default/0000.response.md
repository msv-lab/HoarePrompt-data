Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_16` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the length `n` and the two strings `s` and `t` using the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Counting 'a' and 'b'**: It counts the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings combined. If the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, it is impossible to make the strings equal, and the function prints `-1` and exits.

3. **Identifying Mismatched Indices**: It identifies the indices where `s` and `t` differ and categorizes them into lists `a` and `b` based on the character ('a' or 'b') at those positions.

4. **Generating Swaps**:
   - If the number of mismatched 'a' indices is odd, it makes an extra swap to balance the counts.
   - It then pairs the remaining mismatched 'a' indices and generates the swap operations.
   - Similarly, it pairs the mismatched 'b' indices and generates the swap operations.

5. **Outputting the Result**: The function outputs the number of swaps and the swap operations using the helper function `func_17`.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including edge cases like:
- Strings with an odd number of 'a' or 'b' characters.
- Strings with no mismatches.
- Strings with an even number of mismatches.

Since the function follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all edge cases correctly, the program is correct.
