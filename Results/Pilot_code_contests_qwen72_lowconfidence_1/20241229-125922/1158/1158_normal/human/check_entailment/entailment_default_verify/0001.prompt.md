You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "a" and "b". 

Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.

You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the length of s and t.

The second line contains one string s consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

The third line contains one string t consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

Output

If it is impossible to make these strings equal, print -1.

Otherwise, in the first line print k — the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. In each of the next k lines print two integers — the index in the string s and the index in the string t that should be used in the corresponding swap operation. 

Examples

Input


4
abab
aabb


Output


2
3 3
3 2


Input


1
a
b


Output


-1


Input


8
babbaabb
abababaa


Output


3
2 6
1 3
7 8

Note

In the first example two operations are enough. For example, you can swap the third letter in s with the third letter in t. Then s =  "abbb", t =  "aaab". Then swap the third letter in s and the second letter in t. Then both s and t are equal to "abab".

In the second example it's impossible to make two strings equal.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly account for scenarios where the number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings combined is odd. This is a critical error because if the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, it is impossible to make the two strings equal through any number of swaps.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
abab
baba
```

In this case, the total number of 'a' characters is 4 (even) and the total number of 'b' characters is 4 (even). However, the program will still attempt to perform swaps, which is unnecessary since the strings are already equal. The correct output should be:
```
0
```

Another example where the program fails is:
```
4
abab
abba
```

Here, the total number of 'a' characters is 4 (even) and the total number of 'b' characters is 4 (even), but the program will incorrectly attempt to perform swaps. The correct output should be:
```
1
2 2
```

However, the program will output more than one swap, which is not optimal.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not always produce the correct output for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 17 : The function `func_17` prints the given positional arguments to a specified file stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It separates the arguments using a delimiter specified by the `sep` parameter (defaulting to a single space) and appends a string specified by the `end` parameter (defaulting to a newline character) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the write buffer of the file stream is flushed immediately after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representations of the positional arguments, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys if they were present. The `at_start` flag is `False` if there was at least one positional argument, otherwise, it remains `True`. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where no content is written to the file stream, and the `flush` parameter being `False`, where the buffer is not flushed.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
