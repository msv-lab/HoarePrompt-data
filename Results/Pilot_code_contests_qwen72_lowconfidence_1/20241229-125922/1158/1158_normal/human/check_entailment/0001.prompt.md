You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "a" and "b". 

Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.

You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the length of s and t.

The second line contains one string s consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

The third line contains one string t consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

Output

If it is impossible to make these strings equal, print -1.

Otherwise, in the first line print k — the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. In each of the next k lines print two integers — the index in the string s and the index in the string t that should be used in the corresponding swap operation. 

Examples

Input


4
abab
aabb


Output


2
3 3
3 2


Input


1
a
b


Output


-1


Input


8
babbaabb
abababaa


Output


3
2 6
1 3
7 8

Note

In the first example two operations are enough. For example, you can swap the third letter in s with the third letter in t. Then s =  "abbb", t =  "aaab". Then swap the third letter in s and the second letter in t. Then both s and t are equal to "abab".

In the second example it's impossible to make two strings equal.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
