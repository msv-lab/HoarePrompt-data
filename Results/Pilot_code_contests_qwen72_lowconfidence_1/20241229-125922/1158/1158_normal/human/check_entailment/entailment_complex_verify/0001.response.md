### Analysis and Final Assessment

#### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Transform two strings `s` and `t` of equal length containing only 'a' and 'b' to be equal by performing the minimum number of swaps between characters at specified indices.
- **Constraints**: 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- **Output**: Minimum number of operations required, followed by the indices of the swaps, or -1 if it is impossible to make the strings equal.

#### Original Assessment
- **Original Assessment**: Correctness: **False**
- **Reasoning**: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly, specifically when the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, which makes it impossible to make the strings equal. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the strings are already equal optimally.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
- **Function 16**:
  - **Initial State**: Reads the length `n`, and the strings `s` and `t`.
  - **Counting 'a' and 'b'**:
    - Counts the total number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings.
    - Checks if the total counts of 'a' and 'b' are even. If not, prints -1 and exits.
  - **Finding Mismatched Indices**:
    - Collects indices where `s` and `t` differ.
  - **Handling Odd Lengths**:
    - If the length of `a` (indices of 'a' mismatches) is odd, performs a self-swap to make it even.
  - **Performing Swaps**:
    - Swaps elements in `s` and `t` to make them equal, appending the swap indices to `ans`.
  - **Final Output**:
    - Prints the number of swaps and the swap indices.

#### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Even Count Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total count of 'a' and 'b' is even. If not, it prints -1 and exits, which is correct according to the problem constraints.

2. **Mismatched Indices**:
   - The program correctly identifies indices where `s` and `t` differ and categorizes them into `a` and `b` lists.

3. **Odd Length Handling**:
   - If the length of `a` is odd, the program performs a self-swap to make it even. This is necessary to ensure the number of swaps is even and the strings can be made equal.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program correctly swaps elements in `s` and `t` to make them equal, appending the swap indices to `ans`.
   - The logic ensures that the minimum number of swaps is performed by pairing mismatched indices.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices.

#### Edge Cases
- **Strings Already Equal**:
  - If `s` and `t` are already equal, the program will correctly output 0 swaps.
- **Odd Total Count**:
  - If the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, the program correctly outputs -1.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints. The annotated code confirms that the program's logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Assessment
Final: **True**
