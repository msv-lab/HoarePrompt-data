You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "a" and "b". 

Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.

You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the length of s and t.

The second line contains one string s consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

The third line contains one string t consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

Output

If it is impossible to make these strings equal, print -1.

Otherwise, in the first line print k — the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. In each of the next k lines print two integers — the index in the string s and the index in the string t that should be used in the corresponding swap operation. 

Examples

Input


4
abab
aabb


Output


2
3 3
3 2


Input


1
a
b


Output


-1


Input


8
babbaabb
abababaa


Output


3
2 6
1 3
7 8

Note

In the first example two operations are enough. For example, you can swap the third letter in s with the third letter in t. Then s =  "abbb", t =  "aaab". Then swap the third letter in s and the second letter in t. Then both s and t are equal to "abab".

In the second example it's impossible to make two strings equal.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle certain edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly account for scenarios where the number of 'a' and 'b' characters in both strings combined is odd. This is a critical error because if the total count of 'a' or 'b' is odd, it is impossible to make the two strings equal through any number of swaps.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
abab
baba
```

In this case, the total number of 'a' characters is 4 (even) and the total number of 'b' characters is 4 (even). However, the program will still attempt to perform swaps, which is unnecessary since the strings are already equal. The correct output should be:
```
0
```

Another example where the program fails is:
```
4
abab
abba
```

Here, the total number of 'a' characters is 4 (even) and the total number of 'b' characters is 4 (even), but the program will incorrectly attempt to perform swaps. The correct output should be:
```
1
2 2
```

However, the program will output more than one swap, which is not optimal.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not always produce the correct output for every potential case, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input a value. It then converts the input to an integer and returns this integer value. If the user inputs a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, terminating the function execution. After the function concludes, the program will have returned an integer value (if the input was valid), and no other variables or state changes are affected.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature. The function reads input from the standard input.
def func_2():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user through the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the returned value is the exact input provided by the user. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or special characters, which are treated as part of the input string.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as arguments to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, expecting a string that can be split into integers.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
    #The program returns a map object containing integer values obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting a string where elements are separated by spaces. It splits this string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input string is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input is not terminated by a newline, the function will wait for additional input until a newline is encountered.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are used in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return list(func_3())
    #The program returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The content of this list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`, which is not provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It calls the function `func_3` and returns a list generated from the output of `func_3`. The content of the returned list depends entirely on the implementation of `func_3`, which is not provided. If `func_3` returns an iterable, `func_4` will convert it into a list and return it. If `func_3` returns a non-iterable, `func_4` will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to convert it to a list.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not take any parameters and does not depend on any external variables. It sets the recursion limit and stack size, then starts a new thread to run the `main` function.
def func_5():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
    threading.stack_size(40960000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. After the function `func_5` completes, the recursion limit and stack size are configured as specified, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The main thread that called `func_5` continues its execution independently of the new thread. If the `main` function or the thread creation fails, the behavior is undefined and could result in an error or exception.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: item is a tuple or list where the first element (item[0]) is comparable and can be used for sorting.
def func_6(item):
    return item[0]
    #The program returns the first element of the tuple or list `item` which is comparable and can be used for sorting.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the first element of `item`. The function assumes that the first element is comparable and can be used for sorting. However, the function does not handle cases where `item` is not a tuple or list, or where `item` is empty, which could lead to a TypeError or IndexError, respectively.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of elements where each element is a dictionary or an object with a getKey method defined to return a comparable key.
def func_7(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey)
    #The program returns a sorted list of elements from `l`, where each element is a dictionary or an object with a `getKey` method, sorted based on the keys returned by `getKey`. The exact order of the elements depends on the values of the keys returned by `getKey`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` where each element is either a dictionary or an object with a `getKey` method defined. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted based on the keys returned by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If any element in `l` does not have a `getKey` method, the function will raise an `AttributeError`. The sorting is stable, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order in the output list will be the same as in the input list.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers representing the dimensions of a 2D list, and num is a value of any type that will populate the 2D list.
def func_8(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
    #The program returns a 2D list with dimensions n x m, where each element is the value of `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `num`. It returns a 2D list with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each element is the value of `num`. The function correctly handles the case where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers. If either `n` or `m` is 0, the function will return an empty list or a list of empty lists, respectively. The function does not validate the type of `num`, so it can be any data type.

#Function 9:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer.
def func_9(x):
    return x and not x & x - 1
    #The program returns 0 if x is 0, True if x is a power of 2, and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `0` if `x` is `0`, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly identifies whether `x` is a power of 2 by leveraging bitwise operations. If `x` is `0`, it explicitly returns `0`. For non-zero values, the function checks if `x` is a power of 2 by ensuring that `x & (x - 1)` is `0`. This works because a power of 2 in binary representation has exactly one bit set to `1`, and subtracting `1` from it flips all the bits up to and including the first `1`. Therefore, the bitwise AND of `x` and `x - 1` will be `0` if `x` is a power of 2. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers, which will always return `False` since negative numbers cannot be powers of 2.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_10(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
    #The program returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and returns the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix. The function correctly handles the conversion for all valid inputs within the specified range. No edge cases or missing functionality are present in the provided code. After the function executes, the program state includes the returned string representing the binary form of `n`.

#Function 11:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_11(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from the non-negative integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. If `n` is 0, the function returns a list containing a single element `[0]`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes that `n` is always a non-negative integer. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the returned list of digits, and the original input `n` remains unchanged.

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, p is a positive integer.
def func_12(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        
        y = y >> 1
        
        x = x * x % p
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `res` is `x^y % p` where `x` and `y` are the initial values of these variables, `p` is a positive integer.
    return res
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the initial values of these variables. After the function executes, `y` is 0, and the returned value is `x^y % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1. The annotation stating that the function always returns 1 is incorrect.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers.
def func_13(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`, where `y` is 0. Since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself, the program returns the original value of `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the returned value is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than 1.
def func_14(n):
    if (n <= 1) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 1
    if (n <= 3) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1, and n is greater than 3
    if (n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an integer greater than 1 and greater than 3, and n is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        
        i = i + 6
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1 and 3, not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and `n` is greater than or equal to the square of the largest value of `i` that was checked. `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n` such that `i` is congruent to 5 modulo 6. If `n` is divisible by any prime of the form 6k ± 1 up to this `i`, the program returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that `n` is not divisible by any prime of the form 6k ± 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is greater than or equal to the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is a prime number. The function returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any prime number of the form 6k ± 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is greater than or equal to the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6. The function returns `True` if none of these conditions are met, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Edge cases include `n` being 2 or 3, which are correctly identified as prime numbers, and `n` being 1, which is correctly identified as not a prime number.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function. This function is used to redirect standard input and output to files 'input.txt' and 'output.txt', respectively.
def func_15():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` redirects the standard input to read from the file 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to the file 'output.txt'. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the files do not exist or cannot be opened, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the function does not restore the original standard input and output streams after redirection, so these changes persist until explicitly reverted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` processes two lists of characters `s` and `t`, both of which contain only 'a' and 'b' and have the same length `n`. The function aims to transform `s` into `t` by swapping elements in `s` and `t` at specific indices, while ensuring that the number of swaps required is minimized. The function performs the following actions:

#Function 17:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of any type of values, and kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' defaults to a single space, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline character, and 'flush' defaults to False.
def func_17():

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`. The content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, except there is no trailing `sep` at the end.
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` does not contain `'end'`, `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, the content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'`. If `'flush'` in `kwargs` is `True`, it has been popped and the write buffer of `file` has been flushed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_17` prints the given positional arguments to a specified file stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It separates the arguments using a delimiter specified by the `sep` parameter (defaulting to a single space) and appends a string specified by the `end` parameter (defaulting to a newline character) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the write buffer of the file stream is flushed immediately after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representations of the positional arguments, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys if they were present. The `at_start` flag is `False` if there was at least one positional argument, otherwise, it remains `True`. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where no content is written to the file stream, and the `flush` parameter being `False`, where the buffer is not flushed.
