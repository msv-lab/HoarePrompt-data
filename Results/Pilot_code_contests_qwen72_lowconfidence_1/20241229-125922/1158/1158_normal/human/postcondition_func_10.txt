The function `func_11` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `n`. The function handles the conversion of the integer to a string, iterates over each character in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and collects these integers into a list. If `n` is 0, the function returns a list containing a single element `[0]`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, and it assumes that `n` is always a non-negative integer. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the returned list of digits, and the original input `n` remains unchanged.
