The function `func_12` accepts three parameters `x`, `y`, and `p`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `p` is a positive integer. It computes and returns `x^y % p`, where `x` and `y` are the initial values of these variables. After the function executes, `y` is 0, and the returned value is `x^y % p`. The function correctly handles the case where `y` is 0, returning 1. The annotation stating that the function always returns 1 is incorrect.
