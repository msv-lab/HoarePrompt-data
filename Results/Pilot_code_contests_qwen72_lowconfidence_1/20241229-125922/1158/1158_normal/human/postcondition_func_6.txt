The function `func_7` accepts a list `l` where each element is either a dictionary or an object with a `getKey` method defined. It returns a new list containing the elements of `l` sorted based on the keys returned by `getKey`. The original list `l` remains unchanged. If any element in `l` does not have a `getKey` method, the function will raise an `AttributeError`. The sorting is stable, meaning that if two elements have the same key, their relative order in the output list will be the same as in the input list.
