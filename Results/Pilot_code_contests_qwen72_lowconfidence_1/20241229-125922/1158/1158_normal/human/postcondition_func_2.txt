The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from the standard input, expecting a string where elements are separated by spaces. It splits this string into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. If the input string is empty or contains non-integer values, the function will raise a `ValueError`. If the input is not terminated by a newline, the function will wait for additional input until a newline is encountered.
