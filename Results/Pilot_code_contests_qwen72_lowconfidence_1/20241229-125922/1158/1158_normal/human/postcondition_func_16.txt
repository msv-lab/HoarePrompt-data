The function `func_17` prints the given positional arguments to a specified file stream, or to `sys.stdout` by default. It separates the arguments using a delimiter specified by the `sep` parameter (defaulting to a single space) and appends a string specified by the `end` parameter (defaulting to a newline character) at the end. If the `flush` parameter is set to `True`, the write buffer of the file stream is flushed immediately after writing. The function does not return any value. After the function executes, the `file` stream contains the concatenated string representations of the positional arguments, separated by `sep`, followed by `end`. The `kwargs` dictionary is modified by removing the `sep`, `file`, `end`, and `flush` keys if they were present. The `at_start` flag is `False` if there was at least one positional argument, otherwise, it remains `True`. Edge cases include handling an empty `args` tuple, where no content is written to the file stream, and the `flush` parameter being `False`, where the buffer is not flushed.
