The function `func_15` redirects the standard input to read from the file 'input.txt' and the standard output to write to the file 'output.txt'. After the function executes, any subsequent input operations (e.g., `input()`) will read from 'input.txt', and any subsequent output operations (e.g., `print()`) will write to 'output.txt'. The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur if the files do not exist or cannot be opened, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, the function does not restore the original standard input and output streams after redirection, so these changes persist until explicitly reverted.
