The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a single line of input from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the returned value is the exact input provided by the user. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or special characters, which are treated as part of the input string.
