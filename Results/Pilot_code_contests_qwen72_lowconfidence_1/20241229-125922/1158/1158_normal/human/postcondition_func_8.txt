The function `func_9` accepts an integer `x`. It returns `0` if `x` is `0`, `True` if `x` is a power of 2, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly identifies whether `x` is a power of 2 by leveraging bitwise operations. If `x` is `0`, it explicitly returns `0`. For non-zero values, the function checks if `x` is a power of 2 by ensuring that `x & (x - 1)` is `0`. This works because a power of 2 in binary representation has exactly one bit set to `1`, and subtracting `1` from it flips all the bits up to and including the first `1`. Therefore, the bitwise AND of `x` and `x - 1` will be `0` if `x` is a power of 2. The function handles all integer inputs, including negative integers, which will always return `False` since negative numbers cannot be powers of 2.
