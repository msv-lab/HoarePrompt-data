The provided code snippet is a comment that describes the functionality of a print function. It does not actually execute any changes to the variables or the program state. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any type of values, and kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'sep', 'file', 'end', and 'flush'. 'sep' defaults to a single space, 'file' defaults to sys.stdout, 'end' defaults to a newline character, and 'flush' defaults to False.**
