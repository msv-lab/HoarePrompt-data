Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 1. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`: 
- If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is an empty list.
- Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1]`.
If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.***
