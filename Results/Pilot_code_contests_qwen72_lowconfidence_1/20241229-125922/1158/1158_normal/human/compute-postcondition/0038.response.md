The code snippet reassigns the variable `b` to an empty list. This overrides the previous definition of `b` as twice the number of non-'a' characters in `s` (or `t`). Since the program does not exit due to this assignment, it implies that the conditions `a` % 2 == 1 or `b` % 2 == 1 did not cause an exit before this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b` and retains the unchanged state of other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**
