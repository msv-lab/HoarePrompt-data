To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can continue based on the provided state and the loop structure.

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is 0.
- If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
  - If the first character of `s` is 'a', `a` is `[0]` and `b` is an empty list.
  - Otherwise, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[0]`.
- If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer (so `n > 0`).
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 1.
- Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` was 0, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`, then if the first character of `s` is 'a', `a` is [0] and `b` is an empty list. Otherwise, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[0]`. If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.**
