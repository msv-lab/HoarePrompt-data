The code `a.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `a`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s` (unchanged).
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()` (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).

The conditions for `a` and `b` are:
- If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
  - If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0]` and `b` is an empty list.
  - Otherwise, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[0]`.
- If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.

Given these conditions, the code `a.append(i)` will append `1` to the list `a` only if `a` is not an empty list. Therefore, the only scenario where `a.append(i)` will have an effect is when the first character of `s` is 'a' and not equal to the first character of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 1, if the first character of `s` is 'a' and not equal to the first character of `t`, then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is an empty list. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain as they were in the initial state.**
