Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any type of values and must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `True`. If `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the value of `sep` appended to its current content.***
