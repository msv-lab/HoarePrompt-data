The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `i`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. However, since the initial state specifies that the values of `a` and `b` depend on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`, and the code does not alter these lists, the conditions for updating `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`. If `s[2]` is 'a', `a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` is incremented by 1.**
