The value `i` (which is 0) is appended to the list `a`. This operation changes the length of `a`, but since `nn` is defined as the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd), `nn` remains unchanged because appending one element to `a` does not affect its parity.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `t` is updated such that for every pair of indices `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `i` ranges from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, the values `t[a[i+1]]` and `t[a[i]]` are swapped, `s` is updated such that for every pair of indices `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `i` ranges from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, the values `s[a[i]]` and `s[a[i+1]]` are swapped, `a` is now `a` with an additional element `0` appended, `b` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of pairs `[a[i] + 1, a[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd), `b` is an empty list, the current value of `s[i]` is 'a', and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `t[i]`.**
