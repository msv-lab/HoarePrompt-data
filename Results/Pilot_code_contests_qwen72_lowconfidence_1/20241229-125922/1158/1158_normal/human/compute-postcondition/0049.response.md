The code snippet `b.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `b`.

- Given the initial state, `i` is 1.
- The initial state mentions that if the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`, and if the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0]` and `b` is an empty list. Otherwise, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[0]`.
- However, the initial state also mentions that if the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.
- Since the initial state does not specify which condition is true (whether the first characters of `s` and `t` are equal or not), we consider both possibilities.

If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`:
- `a` remains an empty list.
- `b` remains an empty list before the code is executed.
- After `b.append(i)`, `b` becomes `[1]`.

If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
- If the first character of `s` is 'a':
  - `a` is `[0]`.
  - `b` is an empty list before the code is executed.
  - After `b.append(i)`, `b` becomes `[1]`.
- Otherwise:
  - `a` is an empty list.
  - `b` is `[0]` before the code is executed.
  - After `b.append(i)`, `b` becomes `[0, 1]`.

Since the initial state does not specify which condition holds, we assume the most general case where the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t` and the first character of `s` is not 'a'. This leads to the most inclusive output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an empty list, `b` is `[1]`.**
