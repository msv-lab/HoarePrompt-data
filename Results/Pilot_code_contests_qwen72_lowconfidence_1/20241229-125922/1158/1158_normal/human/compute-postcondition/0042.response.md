The code `a.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is [0], `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0, the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`, and the first character of `s` is 'a'.**
