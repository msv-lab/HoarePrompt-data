The value of `i` is 2. The operation `a.append(i)` adds the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `a`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
  - If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1]` before this operation, and `b` is an empty list.
  - If the first character of `s` is not 'a', then `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1]`.

After executing `a.append(i)`, the list `a` will be updated to include the value 2. Therefore:

- If the first character of `s` is 'a', `a` will become `[0, 1, 2]`.
- If the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` will become `[2]`.
- If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, so `a` will become `[2]` from being an initially empty list.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, if the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `b` is an empty list; if the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` is `[2]` and `b` is `[1]`; if the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` is `[2]` and `b` remains an empty list.**
