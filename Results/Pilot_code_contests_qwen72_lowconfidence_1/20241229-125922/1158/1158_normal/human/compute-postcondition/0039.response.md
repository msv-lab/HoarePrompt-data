To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `b` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
- The initial state already specifies that `n` is a positive integer, which means `n > 0`.

### States to Adjust:
- The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, which is already given.
- The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
Since `n` is already a positive integer, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The only new state we need to add is the initialization of `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
