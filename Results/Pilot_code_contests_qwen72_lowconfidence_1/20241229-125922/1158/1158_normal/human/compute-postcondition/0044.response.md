The value `0` is appended to the list `b`, as `i` is initially `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is `[0]`, `i` is `0`, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`. The first character of `s` is not 'a'.
