To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is undefined.
- `t` and `s` are updated as described.
- `a` contains the indices as described.
- `b` contains the indices as described.
- `ans` is a list of pairs `[b[i] + 1, b[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `len(b)-2` in steps of `2`.
- `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` as described.
- `func_17(len(a))` has been called.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in ans:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`ans` must be non-empty**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. This means that the list comprehension used to create `ans` must produce at least one pair.
2. **`b` must have at least two elements**: Since `ans` is constructed by taking pairs of elements from `b` (with steps of 2), `b` must have at least two elements for `ans` to be non-empty.
3. **`i` will be defined inside the loop**: The variable `i` will be defined and will take on the values of the elements in `ans` during each iteration of the loop.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `b` has at least two elements.
- Ensure that `ans` is non-empty.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is undefined, `t` and `s` are updated as described, `a` contains the indices as described, `b` contains the indices as described and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list of pairs `[b[i] + 1, b[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `len(b)-2` in steps of `2` and must be non-empty, `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` as described, `func_17(len(a))` has been called.**
