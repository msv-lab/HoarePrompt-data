Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is 'a', `a` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `b` is an empty list. If `s[2]` is not 'a' and the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` is `[2]` and `b` is an empty list. If `s[2]` is not 'a' and the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1, 2]`. If `s[2]` is not 'a' and the first character of `s` is 'a', `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is `[2]`. If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.***
