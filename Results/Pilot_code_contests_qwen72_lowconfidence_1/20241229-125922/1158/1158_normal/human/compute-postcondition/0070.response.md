The code snippet appends a new list to `ans` containing the values of `a[i] + 1` and `a[i + 1] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so the new elements appended to `ans` will be `[a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1]`.

Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is `a[2]` and `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`. The values of `a[2]` and `a[3]` are not specified in the initial state, but they remain unchanged. Therefore, the new elements added to `ans` will be `[a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1]`.

The rest of the variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated with `s[a[0]]` at position `a[1]` and `s[a[1]]` at position `a[0]`, `s` is updated with `t[a[1]]` at position `a[0]` and `t[a[0]]` at position `a[1]`, `a` and `b` are unchanged, `ans` is `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1]`, `nn` must be at least 4, `i` is 2**
