Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is twice the number of 'a' characters in `s` (or `t`), `b` is twice the number of non-'a' characters in `s` (or `t`). If `a` % 2 == 1 or `b` % 2 == 1, the program exits; no further state information is available. Otherwise, the program continues with no changes to the variables.***
