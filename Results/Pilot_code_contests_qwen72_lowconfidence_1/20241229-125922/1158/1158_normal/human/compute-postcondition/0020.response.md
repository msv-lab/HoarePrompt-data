The code snippet `file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))` performs the following actions:

1. It attempts to remove and retrieve the value associated with the key `'end'` from the `kwargs` dictionary.
2. If `'end'` is present in `kwargs`, its value is used; otherwise, `'\n'` (newline character) is used.
3. The retrieved value is written to the `file` object.

Given the initial state:
- `args` is a tuple of any type of values.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters `'end'` and `'flush'`.
- `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.
- The content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, except there is no trailing `sep` at the end.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `'end'` from `kwargs` is written to `file`. If `'end'` is not in `kwargs`, `'\n'` is written to `file`.
- The key `'end'` is removed from `kwargs`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `args` is a tuple of any type of values.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters, but `'end'` is no longer in `kwargs`.
- `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`.
- The content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'`.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` does not contain `'end'`, `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, the content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'`.**
