The code snippet `b.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `b`. We need to consider the initial conditions and how they affect the final state.

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is 2.
- If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
  - If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is an empty list.
  - Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1]`.
- If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.

Given these conditions, the value of `b` before executing the code snippet could be:
- An empty list if the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`.
- `[1]` if the first character of `s` is not 'a' and not equal to the first character of `t`.

After executing `b.append(i)`, the value of `b` will be:
- `[2]` if the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`.
- `[1, 2]` if the first character of `s` is not 'a' and not equal to the first character of `t`.

The value of `a` remains unchanged based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, if the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t` then `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[2]`, otherwise if the first character of `s` is 'a' then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is `[2]`, otherwise if the first character of `s` is not 'a' then `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1, 2]`.**
