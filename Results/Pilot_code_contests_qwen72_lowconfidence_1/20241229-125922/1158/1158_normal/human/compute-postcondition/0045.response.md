Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`. If the first character of `s` is 'a', `a` is [0] and `b` is an empty list. Otherwise, `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[0]`.***
