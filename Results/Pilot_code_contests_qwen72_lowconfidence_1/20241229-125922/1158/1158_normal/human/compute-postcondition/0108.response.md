To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is the next pair in `ans`.
- `t` and `s` are updated as described.
- `a` contains the indices as described.
- `b` contains the indices as described and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ans` is a list of pairs `[b[i] + 1, b[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `len(b)-2` in steps of `2` and must be non-empty.
- `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` as described.
- `func_17(len(a))` has been called.
- `func_17(*i)` has been called.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in ans:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `ans`.
2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the next pair in `ans`.
   - `ans` is a list of pairs, and it must be non-empty for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- After the previous iteration, `i` has been set to the next pair in `ans`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another pair in `ans`.

### Conclusion:
- The state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to the next pair in `ans`.
- The list `ans` must still have at least one more pair for the loop to execute again.

### Updated State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is the next pair in `ans`, `t` and `s` are updated as described, `a` contains the indices as described, `b` contains the indices as described and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list of pairs `[b[i] + 1, b[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `len(b)-2` in steps of `2` and must have at least one more pair, `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` as described, `func_17(len(a))` has been called, `func_17(*i)` has been called.**
