Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `b` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`. If no characters in `s` differ from `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists, `ans` is an empty list. Additionally, the length of `a` is even.***
