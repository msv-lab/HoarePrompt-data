Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `b` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `ans` is an empty list, and `nn` is the length of `a`. If the length of `a` is even, `nn` remains the length of `a`. If the length of `a` is odd, `t[a[-1]]` is updated to 'a', `s[a[-1]]` is updated to the character from `t[a[-1]]`, `ans` is a list containing `[a[-1] + 1, a[-1] + 1]`, and `nn` is an even number equal to `len(a) - 1`.***
