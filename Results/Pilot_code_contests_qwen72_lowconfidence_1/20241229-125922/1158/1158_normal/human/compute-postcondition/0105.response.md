The code `func_17(*i)` calls the function `func_17` with the unpacked arguments from the variable `i`. However, since `i` is undefined in the initial state, this call will result in an error. No changes occur to any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is undefined, `t` and `s` are updated as described, `a` contains the indices as described, `b` contains the indices as described and must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list of pairs `[b[i] + 1, b[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `len(b)-2` in steps of `2` and must be non-empty, `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` as described, `func_17(len(a))` has been called.**
