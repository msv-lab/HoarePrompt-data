Postcondition: ***`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` does not contain `'end'`, `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, the content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'`. If `'flush'` in `kwargs` is `True`, it has been popped and the write buffer of `file` has been flushed.***
