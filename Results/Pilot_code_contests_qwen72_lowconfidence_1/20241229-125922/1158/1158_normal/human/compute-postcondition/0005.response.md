The code snippet `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the file specified by `file`. Given the initial state:

- `args` is a tuple of any type of values and must contain at least one element.
- `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush'.
- `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`.
- `at_start` is `False`.

The `file.write(sep)` operation will write the value of `sep` to the specified `file`. Since `file` is either a file object or `sys.stdout`, and `sep` is a string (either from `kwargs` or `' '`), this operation does not change the values of `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, `file`, or `at_start`. However, the content of the file or the standard output will be updated.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`args` is a tuple of any type of values and must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`, `at_start` is `False`, `file` now contains the value of `sep` appended to its current content.**
