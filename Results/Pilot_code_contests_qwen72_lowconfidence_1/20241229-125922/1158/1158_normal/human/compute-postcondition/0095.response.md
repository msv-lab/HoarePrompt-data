Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n > 0` otherwise `i` is undefined, `t` is updated such that for every pair of indices `(a[j], a[j+1])` where `j` ranges from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, the values `t[a[j+1]]` and `t[a[j]]` are swapped, `s` is updated such that for every pair of indices `(a[j], a[j+1])` where `j` ranges from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, the values `s[a[j]]` and `s[a[j+1]]` are swapped, `a` contains the indices `i` where `s[i] == 'a'` and `s[i] != t[i]` for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `b` contains the indices `i` where `s[i] != 'a'` and `s[i] != t[i]` for every `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `ans` is a list of pairs `[a[j] + 1, a[j + 1] + 1]` for every `j` from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd).**
