The code snippet modifies the `sep` and `file` variables by using the `kwargs.pop` method to extract their values from the `kwargs` dictionary. If these keys are not present in the dictionary, default values are used.

- `sep` is set to the value of `'sep'` in `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise it defaults to a single space `' '`.
- `file` is set to the value of `'file'` in `kwargs` if it exists, otherwise it defaults to `sys.stdout`.

After this operation, the `kwargs` dictionary will no longer contain the `'sep'` and `'file'` keys, if they were originally present.

Output State: **args is a tuple of any type of values, kwargs is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs`.**
