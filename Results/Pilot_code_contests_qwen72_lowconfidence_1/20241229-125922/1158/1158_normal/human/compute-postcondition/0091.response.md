The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`.

Given the Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is 2
- `a` is unchanged unless `s[2]` is 'a', in which case `0` is appended to `a`
- If `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, `t` is updated, and `s` is updated similarly, and `b` is `[1]` if `s[2]` is not 'a', otherwise `b` is `[0]`
- `ans` is a list of pairs `[a[i] + 1, a[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`
- `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd)
- If `s[2]` is equal to `t[2]`, `s` and `t` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` retain their initial states

After executing `a.append(i)`:
- `i` is 2, so `2` is appended to `a`.
- The length of `a` increases by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `a` is unchanged unless `s[2]` is 'a', in which case `0` is appended to `a` followed by `2`; if `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, `t` is updated, and `s` is updated similarly, and `b` is `[1]` if `s[2]` is not 'a', otherwise `b` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of pairs `[a[i] + 1, a[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`; `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd); if `s[2]` is equal to `t[2]`, `s` and `t` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` retain their initial states.**
