The `file.flush()` method is called, which flushes the write buffer of the file stream, ensuring all buffered data is written to the file. This operation does not change the values of the variables but ensures that any pending writes to the file are completed.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values, `kwargs` does not contain `'end'`, `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is `False` if `args` contains at least one element, otherwise `at_start` remains `True`, the content of `file` includes the string representations of all elements in `args`, separated by `sep`, followed by the value of `'end'` from `kwargs` or `'\n'`, `'flush'` in `kwargs` has been popped and is currently `True`, and the write buffer of `file` has been flushed.**
