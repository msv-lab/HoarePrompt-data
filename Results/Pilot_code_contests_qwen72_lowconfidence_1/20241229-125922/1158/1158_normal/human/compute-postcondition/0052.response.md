To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is 1.
- If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`:
  - If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is an empty list.
  - Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1]`.
- If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the first character of `t`: 
- If the first character of `s` is 'a', then `a` is `[0, 1]` and `b` is an empty list.
- Otherwise, if the first character of `s` is not 'a', `a` is an empty list and `b` is `[1]`.
If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `t`, `a` and `b` remain empty lists.**
