The value of `a` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `s[2]` is 'a', `a` is incremented by 1, this indicates that `s[2]` must be 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, `a` is incremented by 1, `b` is unchanged.**
