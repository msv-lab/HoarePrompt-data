The function call `func_17(-1)` is executed, but without the definition of `func_17`, we cannot determine its exact behavior or output. However, based on the information provided, we can assume that this function does not modify the global variables `n`, `t`, `s`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` is twice the number of 'a' characters in `s` (or `t`), `b` is twice the number of non-'a' characters in `s` (or `t`). Either `a` is odd or `b` is odd.**
