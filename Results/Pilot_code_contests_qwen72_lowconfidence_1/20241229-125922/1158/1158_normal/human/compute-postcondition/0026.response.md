The value of `a` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `b` is not affected, and its relationship to `t[2]` and `s[2]` remains the same. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, `a` is `a + 1`, and the values of `b` will be determined based on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`.**
