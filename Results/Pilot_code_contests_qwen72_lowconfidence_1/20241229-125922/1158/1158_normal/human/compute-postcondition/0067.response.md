The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. This element is a list containing two values: `a[i] + 1` and `a[i + 1] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`.
- `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`.
- `b` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `nn` is an even number and must be at least 2.
- `i` is 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` now contains one element, which is `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1]`.
- `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `nn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `b` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `ans` is a list containing one element `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1]`, `nn` is an even number and must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
