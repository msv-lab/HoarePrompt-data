Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `a` is unchanged unless `s[2]` is 'a', in which case `0` is appended to `a`. If `s[2]` is 'a', `2` is appended to `a` after the initial append of `0`. If `s[2]` is not equal to `t[2]`, `t` is updated such that for every pair of indices `(a[i], a[i+1])` where `i` ranges from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`, the values `t[a[i+1]]` and `t[a[i]]` are swapped, and `s` is updated similarly. `b` is `[1, 2]` if `s[2]` is not 'a', otherwise `b` is `[0, 2]`. `ans` is a list of pairs `[a[i] + 1, a[i + 1] + 1]` for every `i` from `0` to `nn-2` in steps of `2`. `nn` is an even number and is the length of `a` (if the length of `a` was initially even) or `len(a) - 1` (if the length of `a` was initially odd). If `s[2]` is equal to `t[2]`, `s` and `t` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` retain their initial states.***
