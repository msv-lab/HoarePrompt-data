Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2. If `t[2]` is 'a', `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `s[2]` is 'a', `a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` is incremented by 1.***
