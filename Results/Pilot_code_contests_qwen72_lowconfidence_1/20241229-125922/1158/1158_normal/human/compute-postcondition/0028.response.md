Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, and the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`. If `s[2]` is 'a', `a` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b` is incremented by 1.***
