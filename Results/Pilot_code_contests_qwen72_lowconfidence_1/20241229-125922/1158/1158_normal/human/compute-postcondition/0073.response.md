The code snippet `ans.append([a[i] + 1, a[i + 1] + 1])` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is a list containing two values: `a[i] + 1` and `a[i + 1] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 4
- `ans` is `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1]`

The new values to be appended are:
- `a[i] + 1` which is `a[4] + 1`
- `a[i + 1] + 1` which is `a[5] + 1`

Thus, the new element being appended to `ans` is `[a[4] + 1, a[5] + 1]`.

The updated state of `ans` is therefore:
- `ans` is `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1, [a[4] + 1, a[5] + 1]]`

All other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is updated with `s[a[0]]` at position `a[1]` and `s[a[1]]` at position `a[0]`, `s` is updated with `t[a[1]]` at position `a[0]` and `t[a[0]]` at position `a[1]`, `a` and `b` are unchanged, `ans` is `[a[0] + 1, a[1] + 1, a[2] + 1, a[3] + 1, [a[4] + 1, a[5] + 1]]`, `nn` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `s[a[2]]` is `t[a[3]]`, `t[a[3]]` is `s[a[2]]`**
