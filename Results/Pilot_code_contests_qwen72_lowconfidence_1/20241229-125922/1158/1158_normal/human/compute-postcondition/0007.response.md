The code snippet `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the file object `file`.

- `file` is the file object where the content is written. This could be `sys.stdout` or another file object depending on the value provided in `kwargs`.
- `x` is converted to a string using `str(x)` and written to `file`.

The variables `args`, `kwargs`, `sep`, and `at_start` remain unchanged. The state of `file` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current content.

Output State: **`args` is a tuple of any type of values and must contain at least one element, `kwargs` is a dictionary containing optional parameters 'end' and 'flush', `sep` is the value of `'sep'` from `kwargs` or `' '` if `'sep'` was not in `kwargs`, `file` is the value of `'file'` from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout` if `'file'` was not in `kwargs` with the string representation of `x` appended to its content, `at_start` is `True`.**
