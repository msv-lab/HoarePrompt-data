The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `b` depends on its previous value, which is not specified in the initial state. However, the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`, but since the code snippet does not modify `t[2]` or `s[2]`, these dependencies remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `t` is a list of characters equal to `s`, `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()`, `i` is 2, `b` is increased by 1, and the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the new values of `t[2]` and `s[2]`.**
