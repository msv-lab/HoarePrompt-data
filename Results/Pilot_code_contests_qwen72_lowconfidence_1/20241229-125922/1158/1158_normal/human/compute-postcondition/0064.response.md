The given code snippet swaps the characters at the index `a[-1]` between lists `s` and `t`.

- `s[a[-1]]` and `t[a[-1]]` are swapped.
- Since `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, swapping these characters means that the character at `s[a[-1]]` (which is 'a') will move to `t[a[-1]]`, and the character at `t[a[-1]]` (which is not 'a') will move to `s[a[-1]]`.

Therefore, after the swap:
- The character at `s[a[-1]]` is now the character from `t[a[-1]]`.
- The character at `t[a[-1]]` is now 'a'.

All other variables (`n`, `t` (except at index `a[-1]`), `s` (except at index `a[-1]`), `a`, `b`, `ans`, `nn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a list of characters equal to the original `s` except `t[a[-1]]` is now 'a', `s` is a list of characters returned by `func_2()` except `s[a[-1]]` is now the character from `t[a[-1]]`, `a` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `b` contains the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'a' and do not match the corresponding characters in `t`, `ans` is a list containing `[a[-1] + 1, a[-1] + 1]`, `nn` is an even number equal to `len(a) - 1`.**
