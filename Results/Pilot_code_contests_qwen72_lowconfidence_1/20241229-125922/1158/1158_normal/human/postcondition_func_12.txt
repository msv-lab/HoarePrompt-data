The function `func_13` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`. It computes and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. After the function executes, the returned value is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`. If either `x` or `y` is zero, the function correctly returns the non-zero value as the GCD, since the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
