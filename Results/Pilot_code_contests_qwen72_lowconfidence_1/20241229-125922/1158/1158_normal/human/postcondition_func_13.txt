The function `func_14` accepts an integer `n` greater than 1 and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is a prime number. The function returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1, if `n` is 2 or 3, if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, or if `n` is divisible by any prime number of the form 6k Â± 1 up to the smallest integer `i` that is greater than or equal to the square root of `n` and congruent to 5 modulo 6. The function returns `True` if none of these conditions are met, indicating that `n` is a prime number. Edge cases include `n` being 2 or 3, which are correctly identified as prime numbers, and `n` being 1, which is correctly identified as not a prime number.
