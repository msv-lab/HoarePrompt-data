The function `func_6` accepts a single parameter `item`, which is expected to be a tuple or list. It returns the first element of `item`. The function assumes that the first element is comparable and can be used for sorting. However, the function does not handle cases where `item` is not a tuple or list, or where `item` is empty, which could lead to a TypeError or IndexError, respectively.
