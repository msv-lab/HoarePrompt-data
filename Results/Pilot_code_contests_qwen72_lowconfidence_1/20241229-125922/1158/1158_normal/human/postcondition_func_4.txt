The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It sets the recursion limit to 100,000,000 and the stack size to 40,960,000 bytes. It then creates a new thread to execute the `main` function and starts this thread. After the function `func_5` completes, the recursion limit and stack size are configured as specified, and a new thread is running the `main` function. The main thread that called `func_5` continues its execution independently of the new thread. If the `main` function or the thread creation fails, the behavior is undefined and could result in an error or exception.
