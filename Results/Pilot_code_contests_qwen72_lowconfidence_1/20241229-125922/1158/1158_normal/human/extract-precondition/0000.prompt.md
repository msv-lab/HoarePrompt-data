You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Monocarp has got two strings s and t having equal length. Both strings consist of lowercase Latin letters "a" and "b". 

Monocarp wants to make these two strings s and t equal to each other. He can do the following operation any number of times: choose an index pos_1 in the string s, choose an index pos_2 in the string t, and swap s_{pos_1} with t_{pos_2}.

You have to determine the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to make s and t equal, and print any optimal sequence of operations — or say that it is impossible to make these strings equal.

Input

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^{5}) — the length of s and t.

The second line contains one string s consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

The third line contains one string t consisting of n characters "a" and "b". 

Output

If it is impossible to make these strings equal, print -1.

Otherwise, in the first line print k — the minimum number of operations required to make the strings equal. In each of the next k lines print two integers — the index in the string s and the index in the string t that should be used in the corresponding swap operation. 

Examples

Input


4
abab
aabb


Output


2
3 3
3 2


Input


1
a
b


Output


-1


Input


8
babbaabb
abababaa


Output


3
2 6
1 3
7 8

Note

In the first example two operations are enough. For example, you can swap the third letter in s with the third letter in t. Then s =  "abbb", t =  "aaab". Then swap the third letter in s and the second letter in t. Then both s and t are equal to "abab".

In the second example it's impossible to make two strings equal.
Program:
```
def func_17(*args, **kwargs):
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    (sep, file) = (kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout))
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        file.write(str(x))
        at_start = False
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False):
        file.flush()
```
