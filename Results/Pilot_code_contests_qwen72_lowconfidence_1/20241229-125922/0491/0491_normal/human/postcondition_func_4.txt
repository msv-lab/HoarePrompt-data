The function `func_5` takes a sorted list of integers `a` and an integer `x` as parameters. It returns the integer immediately before the position where `x` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain its sorted order. If `x` is already in the list, it returns the integer immediately before the leftmost occurrence of `x`. If `x` is less than or equal to the smallest element in `a`, the function raises a `ValueError`.
