The function `func_7` accepts a sorted list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It returns the first element in `a` that is strictly greater than `x`. If no such element exists (i.e., all elements in `a` are less than or equal to `x`), the function raises a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the integer `x` is also unchanged. The function only modifies the program state by either returning a value from the list or raising an exception.
