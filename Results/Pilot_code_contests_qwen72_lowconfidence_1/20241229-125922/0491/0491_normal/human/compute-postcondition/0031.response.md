Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`). After the loop, `left` > `right`. If `x` is found in `a`, the loop returns the index of `x` in `a`. If `x` is not found in `a`, the loop terminates with `left` > `right` and no index is returned.**
