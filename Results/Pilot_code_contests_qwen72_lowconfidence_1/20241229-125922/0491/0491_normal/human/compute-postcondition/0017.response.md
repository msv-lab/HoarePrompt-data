The value of `right` is updated to `mid - 1`. The initial conditions that remain valid are: `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), and `left` <= `right` after the update. The new value of `right` is `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` is an integer, `right` = `mid` - 1, `mid` = (`left` + `right`) // 2, and `left` <= `right` after the update.**
