The code `right = mid - 1` updates the value of `right` to be one less than the current value of `mid`. Since `mid` was calculated as `(left + right) // 2`, and given that `a[mid]` is greater than `x`, this update narrows the search range to the left half of the current range.

Output State: **a is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, x is an integer, left and right are integers such that 0 <= left <= right < len(a), mid = (left + right) // 2, a[mid] is not equal to x, a[mid] is greater than or equal to x, the current value of a[mid] is greater than x, right = mid - 1**
