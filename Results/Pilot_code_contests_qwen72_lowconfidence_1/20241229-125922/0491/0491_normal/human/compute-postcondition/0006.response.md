The value of `left` is updated to `mid + 1`. The initial conditions state that `a[mid]` is less than `x`, and `mid` is calculated as `(left + right) // 2`. After updating `left`, the new condition is that `left` is now `mid + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **a is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, x is an integer, left is mid + 1, right is an integer such that 0 <= left <= right < len(a), mid = (left + right) // 2, a[mid] is not equal to x, and a[mid] is less than x**
