Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), and `mid` = (`left` + `right`) // 2. If `a[mid]` < `x`, then `left` is updated to `mid` + 1. If `a[mid]` >= `x`, then `right` is updated to `mid` - 1 if `a[mid]` > `x`; otherwise, `left`, `right`, and `mid` remain unchanged. In all cases, `a[mid]` is not equal to `x`.***
