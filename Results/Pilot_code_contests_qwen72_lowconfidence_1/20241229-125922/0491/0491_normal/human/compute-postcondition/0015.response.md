Output State: **The program returns `mid`, which is the integer value calculated as (`left` + `right`) // 2, where `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), and `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The value of `mid` is determined based on the comparison of `a[mid]` with `x`.**
