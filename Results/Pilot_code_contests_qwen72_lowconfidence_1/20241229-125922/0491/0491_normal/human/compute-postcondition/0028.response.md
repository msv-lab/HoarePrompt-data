Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), `mid` is `(left + right) // 2`. If `a[mid] < x`, then `left` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 + 1`. If `a[mid] >= x`, then `right` is updated to `mid - 1` if `a[mid] > x`, otherwise, `left` and `right` remain unchanged.***
