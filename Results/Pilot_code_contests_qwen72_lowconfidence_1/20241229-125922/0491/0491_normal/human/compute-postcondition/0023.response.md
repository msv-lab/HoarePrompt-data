The value of `mid` is calculated as `(left + right) // 2`. This operation does not change the values of `a`, `x`, `left`, or `right`. It only introduces a new variable `mid` with a specific value.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), `mid` is `(left + right) // 2`**
