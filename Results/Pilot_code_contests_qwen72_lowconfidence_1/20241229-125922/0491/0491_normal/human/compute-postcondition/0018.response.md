Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`). If `a[mid] > x`, then `right` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is recalculated as (`left` + `right`) // 2, ensuring that `left` <= `right` after the update.***
