Postcondition: ***a is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, x is an integer, left and right are integers such that 0 <= left <= right < len(a), mid = (left + right) // 2, a[mid] is not equal to x, and a[mid] is greater than or equal to x. If a[mid] > x, then right is updated to mid - 1. Otherwise, the values of left, right, and mid remain unchanged.***
