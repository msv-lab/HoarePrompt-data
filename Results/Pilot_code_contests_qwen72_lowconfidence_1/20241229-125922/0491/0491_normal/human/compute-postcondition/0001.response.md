The code snippet `sys.stdout.write(str(format) % args)` performs the following actions:
- It formats the string `format` using the arguments provided in `args`.
- The formatted string is then written to the standard output (usually the console).

Since the code does not modify the variables `format` or `*args`, their values remain unchanged. However, the function `sys.stdout.write` outputs the formatted string to the console.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`format` is a string that represents a format pattern, `*args` is a variable-length argument list of values that correspond to the format pattern, and the formatted string is written to the console.**
