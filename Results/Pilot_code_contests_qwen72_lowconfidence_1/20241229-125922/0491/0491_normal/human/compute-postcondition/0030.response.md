The `pass` statement does not perform any action. It is used as a placeholder when no operation is needed. Since no operations are performed, none of the variables are modified.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), `mid` is `(left + right) // 2`. If `a[mid] == x`, the program returns the integer value of `mid`. Otherwise, if `a[mid] < x`, then `left` is updated to `(left + right) // 2 + 1`. If `a[mid] > x`, then `right` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `a[mid] == x`, `left` and `right` remain unchanged.**
