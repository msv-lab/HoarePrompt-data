`left` is updated to `mid + 1`. The value of `mid` was `(left + right) // 2`, so now `left` is equal to `(left + right) // 2 + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `x`, `right`, `mid`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` is `(left + right) // 2 + 1`, `right` is an integer such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), `mid` is `(left + right) // 2`**
