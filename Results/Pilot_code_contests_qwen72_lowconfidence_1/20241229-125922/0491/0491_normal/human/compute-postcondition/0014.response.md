The value of `mid` is updated to the integer division result of the sum of `left` and `right` by 2. The values of `a`, `x`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. The condition `0 <= left <= right < len(a)` still holds, and `left <= right` after the update based on the comparison of `a[mid]` with `x`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), `mid` = (`left` + `right`) // 2, and `left` <= `right` after the update based on the comparison of `a[mid]` with `x`.**
