The function `func_9` accepts four parameters: `a`, `x`, `left`, and `right`. 

- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `x` is an integer.
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left <= right < len(a)`.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If the element at index `mid` in the list `a` is equal to `x`, the function returns the index `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(left + right) // 2`.
- **Case_2**: If the element at index `mid` is not equal to `x`, the function returns the integer value of `mid` based on the comparison of `a[mid]` with `x`.
- **Case_3**: If neither of the above conditions are met, the function returns the integer value of `mid`, which is calculated as `(left + right) // 2`.
- **Case_4**: If the loop terminates with `left` > `right`, indicating that `x` was not found in the list `a`, the function returns `-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `a`, an integer `x`, and two integers `left` and `right` such that `0 <= left <= right < len(a)`. It returns the index `mid` where `a[mid] == x` if found. If `x` is not found, it returns `-1`. In other cases, it returns the integer value of `mid` calculated as `(left + right) // 2`.**
