The value of `left` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `left` is no longer valid, but the other conditions remain unchanged. Since `mid` was calculated as `mid = (left + right) // 2`, the new value of `left` is `(left + right) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `left` = `(left + right) // 2 + 1`, `right` is an integer such that 0 <= `left` <= `right` < len(`a`), and `left` <= `right` after the update based on the comparison of `a[mid]` with `x`.**
