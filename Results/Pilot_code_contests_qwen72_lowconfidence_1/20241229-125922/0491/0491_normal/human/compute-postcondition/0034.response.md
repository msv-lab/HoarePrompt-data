Functionality: ** This function, `func_9`, performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers `a` to find the index of a given integer `x`. It accepts four parameters: a sorted list `a`, an integer `x`, and two integers `left` and `right` such that `0 <= left <= right < len(a)`. The function returns the index `mid` where `a[mid] == x` if `x` is found in the list. If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`. The function ensures that after the loop terminates, `left` is greater than `right`, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding `x`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is not present in the list and returns `-1`. **

### Detailed Summary:
- **Parameters:**
  - `a`: A list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - `x`: The integer to search for in the list `a`.
  - `left`: The starting index of the search range, inclusive.
  - `right`: The ending index of the search range, inclusive.

- **Returns:**
  - The index `mid` where `a[mid] == x` if `x` is found in the list.
  - `-1` if `x` is not found in the list.

- **Final State:**
  - If `x` is found, the function returns the index `mid` where `a[mid] == x`.
  - If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1` and the loop terminates with `left` > `right`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `x` is less than the smallest element in the list, the function will correctly return `-1` after `left` exceeds `right`.
  - If `x` is greater than the largest element in the list, the function will also correctly return `-1` after `left` exceeds `right`.
  - If `x` is exactly equal to an element in the list, the function will return the correct index `mid`.
  - If `left` and `right` are initially set to the same value and `x` is not at that index, the function will return `-1` after one iteration of the loop.

The function is designed to efficiently search for an integer in a sorted list using binary search, ensuring that the search space is halved in each iteration until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.
