This function, `func_9`, performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers `a` to find the index of a given integer `x`. It accepts four parameters: a sorted list `a`, an integer `x`, and two integers `left` and `right` such that `0 <= left <= right < len(a)`. The function returns the index `mid` where `a[mid] == x` if `x` is found in the list. If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`. The function ensures that after the loop terminates, `left` is greater than `right`, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding `x`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is not present in the list and returns `-1`.
