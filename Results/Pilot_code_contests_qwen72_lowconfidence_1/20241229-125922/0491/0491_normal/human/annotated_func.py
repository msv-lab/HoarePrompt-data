def func_1(delimiter):

    #The program returns a map object that converts each element from the split input (split by the delimiter, which defaults to a single space) into an integer. The exact integers depend on the user's input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `delimiter`, which is a string used to split the input, defaulting to a single space (' '). It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input using the specified delimiter, and returns a map object that converts each element from the split input into an integer. The exact integers depend on the user's input. If the user inputs non-integer values, the `int` conversion will raise a `ValueError`. If no input is provided, the function will block and wait for user input. After the function concludes, the program will have a map object containing the converted integers, or it will raise an exception if the conversion fails.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `delimiter`, which is a string used to split the user input, defaulting to a single space (' '). It reads user input from the standard input (stdin) and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using the specified delimiter. If the user input is empty or consists only of the delimiter, the function will return an empty list or a list containing an empty string, respectively. If the delimiter is an empty string, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (a string, defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a map object that iterates over the elements of the input string (provided by the user via `raw_input()`) split by the `delimiter`, with each element converted to a float. If the input string contains non-numeric values, the conversion to float will raise a `ValueError`. If the input string is empty, the returned map object will be empty.

If no such element exists (i.e., all elements in `a` are less than or equal to `x`), the function raises a `ValueError`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function, `func_9`, performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers `a` to find the index of a given integer `x`. It accepts four parameters: a sorted list `a`, an integer `x`, and two integers `left` and `right` such that `0 <= left <= right < len(a)`. The function returns the index `mid` where `a[mid] == x` if `x` is found in the list. If `x` is not found, the function returns `-1`. The function ensures that after the loop terminates, `left` is greater than `right`, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding `x`. The function correctly handles the edge case where `x` is not present in the list and returns `-1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10` accepts a single parameter `format`, which is expected to be a string representing a format pattern. It also implicitly accepts a variable-length argument list `*args`, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the function signature. The function writes a formatted string to `sys.stdout` using the provided format pattern and the corresponding values from `*args`. However, the function does not return any value, contrary to the annotation. If `*args` is not provided, the function will raise a `TypeError` because `args` is not defined. If `format` is not a valid format string, a `TypeError` or `ValueError` may also be raised. After the function executes, the formatted string is printed to the standard output, and the function does not return any value.
