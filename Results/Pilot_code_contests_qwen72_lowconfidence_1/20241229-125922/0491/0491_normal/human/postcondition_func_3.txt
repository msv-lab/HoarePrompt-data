The function `func_4` accepts a sorted list `a` and an element `x`. It returns the index `i` of the first occurrence of `x` in the sorted list `a`. If `x` is not found in the list, the function raises a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, and `x` retains its original value. The index `i` is either the position of the first occurrence of `x` in `a` or the insertion point where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`.
