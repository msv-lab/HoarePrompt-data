The function `func_6` accepts a sorted list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It returns the largest element in `a` that is less than or equal to `x`. If no such element exists (i.e., all elements in `a` are greater than `x`), the function raises a `ValueError`. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, and `x` retains its original value.
